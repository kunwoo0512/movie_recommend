    "title": "Primitive War",
    "plot": "In 1968, during the Vietnam War, a Green Beret platoon is attacked and killed in a remote jungle valley by unknown predators. Their commander, Colonel Jericho, calls in Vulture Squad, consisting of team leader Sergeant First Class Ryan Baker, second-in-command Sergeant Xavier Wise, rookie radio operator Leon Verne, former Marines Eli Taylor and Charlie Miller, and snipers Gerald Keyes and Logan Stovall, to find the missing Green Berets, who were on a classified mission. After the Vultures are airdropped into the valley, they search for the Green Berets, finding birdlike tracks and huge feathers from an unknown animal. Baker is attacked by an unseen creature, but drives it away. In a cave, they are ambushed by Deinonychus; they escape but Baker and Verne are separated. Meanwhile, the squad is tracked by a Soviet squad, the Dogs of War, including Tolstoy, Nikita, Sergei, Aleksandr, and Con Nhen, a Vietnamese guerrilla. As the Soviets follow gunfire, Aleksandr is ambushed and killed by the creature that attacked Baker. After encountering and fleeing from a family of Tyrannosaurus, Baker and Verne are rescued by Sofia Wagner, a Soviet paleontologist, who takes them to her hideout at an abandoned research station. She explains that a science experiment overseen by USSR General Grigory Borodin accidentally brought a variety of dinosaur species into the valley, and that Borodin murdered her husband and coworkers for questioning him. As they search for the remaining men, Sofia identifies Baker's attacker as a larger, more dangerous species of raptor. The rest of Vulture Squad are attacked by the Dogs of War, but the fight is interrupted by a flock of Quetzalcoatlus, which kill Tolstoy. Both squads flee, and the Vultures meet up with Baker, Verne, and Sofia before being attacked by Deinonychus, which drag Keyes away. He fights them off but is wounded by a larger raptor, managing to stab its eye, and is saved by the Vultures. The squad escapes by boat, but a dying Keyes stays behind and uses grenades in a last stand against the raptors. Sofia explains that Borodin's project is a particle collider that can create wormholes, and that a malfunction during its first test opened a wormhole that transported the dinosaurs to the present day. She convinces the Vultures to disable it, fearing global destruction. Baker contacts Jericho for extraction, but Jericho demands the collider stay intact until troops arrive. The squad are attacked by Deinonychus, and Stovall sacrifices himself to save the others. At the Soviet base, Borodin's soldiers kill an infant Tyrannosaurus, provoking its parents to attack. As the tyrannosaurs massacre the Soviet soldiers, Vulture Squad plants explosives around the collider, while Baker and Sofia recruit a disillusioned Nikita and Sergei. Miller is attacked by Con Nhen, but kills her and himself by detonating his explosives. The tyrannosaurs leave with their chicks, while Sofia deactivates the collider. Jericho arrives with US reinforcements as a large pack of raptors attack, killing Borodin, Nikita, and Taylor, before Baker sacrifices himself to hold them off. Sofia, Verne, Xavier, and Sergei join Jericho's forces to fight off the remaining raptors, and escape as Vulture Squad's explosives destroy the collider. Jericho regrets the destruction, blaming Vulture for losing the collider, but Sofia warns him that the damage is already done, as the dinosaurs have begun migrating out of the valley.",

    "plot": "Victor, a blind person, witnesses the murder of his close friend Wasim. Despite his blindness, Victor identifies the killer by recognising the distinct scent of the killer's perfume and the killer's vehicle, a Land Rover Defender. Victor's identification leads the cops to suspect that the killer is Russell, who conspired with Wasim's elder brother Tariq, to carry out the murder. Tragically, Victor gets captured by Russell, who throws him into a tub of hydrofluoric acid, resulting in his death. Victor's brother George Peter, the patriarch of the Adattu family, one of the prominent crime families in Kochi, is devastated by the loss. Marco Jr, Peter's adopted brother who had been sent to Italy for safety, returns to India after learning about Victor's death. At Victor's memorial service at their local church, Marco vows to avenge Victor's death, declaring his intent to eliminate everyone involved in the heinous act, including Russell, who is present at the scene. Despite Peter's attempts to dissuade him from taking a path of violence, Marco remains resolute. Meanwhile, Tony Issac, Russell's father and the leader of the Isaac family, a gold smuggling syndicate, manipulates the situation to his advantage and strikes a deal with Peter involving gold biscuits and a ransom, all while plotting further treachery. During Peter's return from the deal, Isaac's henchman Devraj ambushes him in his car, revealing the conspiracy and fatally stabbing him. Peter survives, but is hospitalised, further enraging Marco. Peter informs Marco that Tony and Russell were responsible for Victor's death. As Marco sets out for vengeance, Russell reveals his true nature by severely injuring Marco and using a chainsaw to mutilate the left arm of Marco's right-hand man, Anwar. An enraged Marco retaliates, killing Russell's goons and severely injuring them with the same chainsaw. While preparing to kill Russell, Marco learns that Victor's pregnant wife, Isha, is being held captive by Tony. In exchange for her release, Tony demands the Adattu family's entire gold business operations to be transferred in his name. Marco captures and tortures Dev using phosgene gas. He confesses that Isha is at Tony's guesthouse before dying in an explosion. Marco storms the guesthouse, slaughtering Tony's henchmen brutally to rescue Isha. However, Tony deceives Marco, revealing that Isha is locked in the trunk of Russell's car. Marco and Anwar track Tony down to his farmhouse, where Tony reveals that he is bisexual and attempts to seduce them but Marco cuts off Tony's right hand using a katana and sends it to Russell, disguised as a suitcase containing company documents. In a final trap, Marco rigs Tony's chair with a detonator, which would explode when Tony is lifted off the chair. When the detonator is just about to explode, Tony is hoisted into the air, which triggers the detonator and leaves him mortally wounded. Russell stands helpless outside the warehouse and is unable to do anything but watch as Tony succumbs to his wounds, leading to his death. Meanwhile, Peter kills Tariq by hanging him. Desperate for revenge, Russell seeks help from his elder brother, Cyrus, who is a ruthless and psychotic butcher. They launch an attack on the Adattu mansion during Isha's labour, and begin slaughtering the family. Despite Peter and Marco's valiant efforts, Cyrus and Russell kill all the members of the family, including the children, Marco's fiancée-turned-wife, Maria, and Isha, before leaving with her newborn child. Gravely injured, Marco and Peter are left to mourn their family's deaths. Peter urges Marco to avenge not only Victor, but the entire family. Marco adopts a striking and fearsome appearance and confronts Cyrus and Russell at their factory. Marco fights through their henchmen in a bloody showdown, where he kills Russell by ripping his rib cage using a crowbar and takes out his heart with his bare hand. In a climatic encounter with Cyrus, who holds the newborn child over a pool of acid, Marco decapitates him and rescues the child before pushing him into the acid. Marco completes his path of vengeance and leaves the factory with the child, while paying the ultimate price in the suffering and loss of his family. In the post-credit scene, which takes place some time after the bloody events, Marco spends time with Victor's child in a beach until a platoon of cars arrive.",

Breaking out detained immigrants from a detention center in California, Perfidia humiliates the commanding officer, Steven Lockjaw, who develops a sexual fascination with her. Pat and Perfidia become lovers as the French 75 carry out attacks on politicians' offices, banks, and the power grid. Lockjaw catches Perfidia planting a bomb, but lets her go after she agrees to have sex at a motel. Perfidia gives birth to a baby girl, Charlene, but Pat is unable to persuade her to live as a family. She abandons them to continue her revolutionary activities. After Perfidia is captured at a botched bank robbery, Lockjaw arranges for her to avoid prison in exchange for information about the French 75. She enters witness protection as Lockjaw hunts down her comrades and shoots many of them on sight, forcing the others to go on the run. As Pat and Charlene are forced to live in hiding as Bob and Willa Ferguson, Perfidia escapes Lockjaw's custody and flees to Mexico. 16 years later, living in the sanctuary city of Baktan Cross, Bob has become a paranoid drug addict. He is overprotective of Willa, who has grown into a self-reliant and spirited teenager. Through his vehement anti-immigrant efforts, Lockjaw has become a colonel in the United States military. He is invited to join the Christmas Adventurers Club, a secret society of far-right white supremacists. He hunts for Willa to cover up his interracial relationship, which the club forbids. He hires an indigenous bounty hunter, Avanti Q, who captures Bob's comrade Howard Sommerville, triggering a distress signal to the remaining French 75. Under the guise of an immigration and drug enforcement operation, Lockjaw dispatches his troops to Baktan Cross to find Bob and Willa. Deandra, a trusted member of the French 75, rescues Willa before her school dance is raided. Lockjaw's men attack Bob's home while he is high. He escapes through a tunnel and calls the French 75 for help, but is unable to remember the password.

Fleeing with Sergio's students across the rooftops, Bob falls and is arrested. Deandra brings Willa to a convent of revolutionary nuns, where she learns the truth about her mother's betrayal. The Christmas Adventurers uncover evidence of Lockjaw's relationship with Perfidia and send a member, Tim Smith, to eliminate him and Willa. Raiding the convent, Lockjaw forcibly tests Willa's DNA, confirming he is her biological father and thus making his membership in the Christmas Adventurers Club impossible, and leading him to decide to kill her instead of freeing her. Sergio arranges for Bob to escape custody and drives him to the convent, throwing him from the car before being pulled over by police. Hot-wiring another car, Bob reaches the convent but fails to kill Lockjaw with Sergio's rifle. The colonel hires Avanti to take Willa to a group of far-right mercenaries, who will kill her. Smith tracks Lockjaw down and shoots him in the face with a shotgun, causing him to crash his car, and leaves him for dead. Avanti delivers Willa to the mercenaries, but after a change of heart, frees her and dies gunning them down. Willa takes Avanti's car and pistol and is chased by Smith until she lures him into a crash by exploiting a blind summit. She shoots him dead when he does not know the revolutionary countersign, and tearfully reunites with Bob. A badly scarred Lockjaw is seemingly welcomed into the Christmas Adventurers, but is instead gassed to death and cremated. Returning home with his daughter, Bob gives Willa a letter of hope from her mother, and his blessing as she sets off to join a protest hours away in Oakland.",

In Metropolis, Superman is defeated for the first time by a metahuman called the \"Hammer of Boravia\" and flees to his Fortress of Solitude in Antarctica with the help of the superpowered dog Krypto. They are followed by Angela Spica / The Engineer, an ally of billionaire Lex Luthor. Superman's robots use concentrated solar radiation to heal him and comfort Superman with a message from his birth parents, Jor-El and Lara Lor-Van, who sent him to Earth to save him from the destruction of their planet Krypton. The message was damaged during the journey, so only the first half can be played. Superman returns to Metropolis and is again beaten by the Hammer, who is secretly Luthor's metahuman Ultraman. Superman agrees to be interviewed by Lois Lane, his girlfriend and reporter colleague at the Daily Planet, leading to an argument when Lois presses him on the legal and ethical implications of his actions in Boravia. Luthor unleashes a kaiju on Metropolis as a distraction while he infiltrates the Fortress with Ultraman and the Engineer. They overpower the robots, capture Krypto, and discover the Kryptonian message; the Engineer restores the damaged portion. Superman rescues civilians while fighting the kaiju with the \"Justice Gang\", a team composed of heroes Green Lantern, Mister Terrific, and Hawkgirl. Despite Superman's wanting to take the creature alive, Mister Terrific kills it. Luthor broadcasts the Kryptonian message and Superman is shocked to hear the second half, in which his parents urge him to conquer Earth and take many wives to restore the Kryptonian race. Public opinion turns against Superman, especially when he angrily confronts Luthor looking for Krypto. Lois reassures Superman that she believes he is good, and he confesses his love for her before surrendering himself to the U.S. government. They hand him over to Luthor for detainment and questioning inside an artificial pocket universe where Luthor secretly holds his enemies, including Krypto. Superman is imprisoned with the metahuman Metamorpho. Luthor uses Metamorpho's infant son Joey as leverage to force him to transmute one of his hands into Kryptonite, rendering Superman powerless. During questioning, Luthor murders one of Superman's supporters, Malik Ali. A horrified Metamorpho agrees to help Superman escape, and they free Joey and Krypto. Lois convinces Mister Terrific to help find Superman and they enter the pocket universe, rescuing the others. Lois takes Superman to recuperate with his adoptive human parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent. Jonathan tells the demoralized Superman that his choices and actions determine who he is, not the message from his birth parents. Luthor's girlfriend Eve Teschmacher, who is infatuated with Daily Planet photographer Jimmy Olsen, provides him evidence that Luthor is aiding Boravia in return for half of Jarhanpur's territory. Luthor imprisons her and lures Superman back to Metropolis by opening an unstable portal to the pocket universe, creating a rift in reality that splits the city in half. Superman sends Green Lantern, Hawkgirl, and Metamorpho to stop Boravia from invading Jarhanpur again. Hawkgirl kills Ghurkos and Green Lantern invites Metamorpho to join the Justice Gang. In Metropolis, Superman and Mister Terrific fight the Engineer and Ultraman. After Superman defeats the Engineer, he learns that Ultraman is a clone of himself created by Luthor. With Krypto's help, Superman defeats Ultraman and knocks him into a black hole beneath the rift. At Luthor's headquarters, Mister Terrific closes the rift. Luthor says he orchestrated the Jarhanpur conflict as an excuse to implicate Superman, driven by envy of his public admiration despite being an alien. Superman challenges his ideology, but Luthor remains defiant and is subdued by Krypto. Lois and Jimmy expose Luthor's schemes to the public, clearing Superman's name. Luthor and his associates are arrested, and those trapped in his pocket universe, including Eve, are freed. Lois confesses that she loves Clark too. As Superman recovers at the Fortress, his cousin Kara Zor-El drunkenly arrives to pick up Krypto. The robots comfort Superman with footage of his childhood on Earth with his human parents.",

    "plot": "In modern-day Seoul, an ominous wave of unexplained phenomena, ritualistic murders, possessions, and mass hysteria grips the city. The source of the chaos is a shadowy cult known as the Black Mass, a secretive organization devoted to summoning an ancient demon named Asmodeus. As their dark rituals gain momentum, the city's regular law enforcement finds itself helpless in the face of such supernatural terror. Desperate for a solution, they turn to a mysterious trio known only as the \"Holy Night.\" The Holy Night is a demon-hunting unit made up of three unique individuals. Ba Woo, a gruff and powerful fighter with superhuman strength, leads the group. Haunted by a tragic mission in his past, he is driven by an unrelenting sense of justice. Sharon, a serene yet fierce exorcist, is the spiritual core of the team. Gifted with the ability to sense and expel evil spirits, she draws her power from ancient rites and deep personal faith. The third member, Kim Gun, is a young tech genius and documentarian who brings knowledge, research, and strategy to the table. Though he lacks supernatural powers, his quick thinking and resourcefulness make him indispensable. When the young girl Eun-seo begins exhibiting terrifying signs of possession, her older sister Jung-won, a rational and skeptical neuropsychiatrist, seeks out the Holy Night team. Traditional medicine has failed, and Jung-won, desperate to save her sister, is forced to confront her disbelief in the paranormal. The team discovers that Eun-seo is being groomed by the Black Mass cult to serve as the vessel for Asmodeus during a catastrophic summoning ritual. As the Holy Night investigates, they uncover a disturbing pattern of disappearances, desecrated churches, and hidden ritual sites scattered throughout Seoul. They face violent confrontations with possessed cult followers, survive visions meant to shatter their sanity, and endure attacks designed to tear them apart emotionally and physically. Ba Woo struggles with nightmares of the past, Sharon faces moments of wavering faith, and Kim Gun uncovers that his own estranged father was once involved with the cult's earlier incarnation. Time runs out as the cult prepares for the final ritual in a decaying cathedral hidden beneath the city. The Holy Night storms the site in a desperate bid to stop the summoning. A violent and emotional battle breaks out. Ba Woo takes on the cult's possessed enforcers, Sharon engages the high priest in a spiritual battle of incantations and willpower, and Kim Gun disables the protective spells that shield the ritual. Eun-seo, fully possessed by Asmodeus, threatens to unleash unimaginable destruction. In a bold act of self-sacrifice, Ba Woo allows the demon's essence to partially possess him, using his body as a temporary vessel. With Sharon guiding him through a final exorcism rite, Ba Woo uses the demon's own power to destroy the summoning circle. The backlash of energy nearly kills them all, but it successfully banishes Asmodeus back to the underworld and frees Eun-seo. After the battle, the cult is broken, but scars remain. Eun-seo begins a slow recovery, her memories fragmented. Jung-won, now a believer, chooses to assist the Holy Night in future missions using her medical expertise. The trio, though battered, survives aware that evil never fully dies. In the final scene, the Holy Night receives another mysterious file proof that new darkness is already brewing elsewhere.",

Before leaving, Stoick heeds the advice of his best friend and Hiccup's mentor, local blacksmith Gobber the Belch, and enrolls Hiccup in a dragon-fighting class with other local teens: Fishlegs Ingerman, Snotlout Jorgenson, the Thorston twins Ruffnut and Tuffnut, and Hiccup's crush, Astrid Hofferson. Hiccup is mocked by his peers and struggles in class. Returning to the forest, he finds the Night Fury trapped in a cove, unable to fly because Hiccup's bolas severed half of his tail fin. Hiccup befriends the dragon, naming him \"Toothless\" for his retractable teeth; he builds a harness, saddle, and prosthetic fin, allowing Toothless to fly with Hiccup riding on his back to guide him. Hiccup also learns about dragon behavior from Toothless, which allows him to subdue the captive training dragons, impressing the villagers, but arousing Astrid's suspicions. Meanwhile, Stoick's fleet is damaged while searching for the nest, and returns to Berk. Upon learning he must kill a dragon for his final exam, Hiccup attempts to flee with Toothless, but Astrid discovers them. Hiccup takes her on a flight to show her Toothless' friendliness. During the flight, Toothless is drawn to a dragon's nest, where a gigantic dragon, the Red Death, commands smaller dragons to feed it to avoid being eaten themselves. Realizing the dragons attack Berk for survival, Astrid wants to inform the villagers, but Hiccup advises against it to protect Toothless. In his final exam, Hiccup faces a captive Monstrous Nightmare dragon. Rather than killing it, he attempts to publicly prove dragons can be peaceful, but Stoick inadvertently enrages the Monstrous Nightmare, causing Toothless to emerge from hiding to protect Hiccup. Stoick captures Toothless and disowns Hiccup after discovering the truth. Stoick's fleet uses Toothless to guide him to the nest despite Hiccup's warnings. After reminding a distraught Hiccup he spared Toothless out of sympathy, not cowardice, Astrid has Hiccup rally the other teens to tame the training dragons. Together, they pursue Stoick's fleet to the nest. Stoick and his fleet locate and break open the nest, but the Red Death awakens and overpowers them. The dragon riders arrive to distract the Red Death while Hiccup attempts to free Toothless from a sinking ship. Stoick rescues both Hiccup and Toothless from drowning and reconciles with his son. Hiccup and Toothless lure the Red Death into the air, damage its wing membranes, and set its insides alight, causing it to crash and explode. The dying Red Death's tail hits Hiccup, and he falls into the explosion's fireball. Although Toothless rescues Hiccup, Hiccup loses his left foot. With the Red Death's threat neutralized, the Berk villagers co-exist peacefully with the dragons. Gobber replaces Hiccup's foot and Toothless's fin with prosthetics, and Hiccup, now admired by his fellow villagers, begins a relationship with Astrid.",

    "plot": "Two months after retrieving the key to the source code for the malevolent artificial intelligence known as the Entity, rogue IMF agent Ethan Hunt receives a message from US President Erika Sloane. She informs Ethan that the Entity continues to seize control of global nuclear systems, aided by undercover doomsday cultists. Ethan is ordered to surrender the key, but he refuses and continues pursuing Gabriel, the Entity's former proxy. He and fellow IMF agent Benji Dunn first visit their ill IMF hacker Luther Stickell in his off-grid lab beneath London, where he has finished developing the \"Poison Pill\" malware that can target the Entity. The team recruits Jasper Briggs's partner, Theo Degas, and Gabriel's former lieutenant, Paris, who tells them where Gabriel is. In London, Gabriel's men capture Ethan and IMF agent Grace. Gabriel forces Ethan to recover the \"Podkova\" module developed from the \"Rabbit's Foot\" in the sunken Russian submarine Sevastopol, which would give him control over the Entity. Ethan and Grace escape. Contacting the Entity, Ethan is shown visions of a nuclear apocalypse. The Entity says Luther will die and demands access to a digital bunker in South Africa in order to survive. Ethan tasks his team with getting the Sevastopol's coordinates and retrieving him after the dive. He races to save Luther; however, Gabriel steals the Poison Pill and traps Luther with a time bomb. Luther sacrifices himself to minimize the blast, and Ethan is brought to Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center. With three days until the Entity takes over the remaining nuclear weapons control facilities and launches nuclear armageddon, Ethan convinces Sloane to let him locate the Sevastopol, against CIA Director Eugene Kittridge's objections. Grace, Benji, Paris, and Degas travel to St. Matthew Island in the Bering Sea, home to a Cold War era naval sonar array that detected the Sevastopol's sinking. They meet former CIA analyst William Donloe, who was exiled to the island after Ethan's 1996 break-in at CIA headquarters, who coincidentally memorized the Sevastopol's coordinates. Captured by Russian special forces seeking the coordinates, Grace and Donloe's wife Tapeesa escape by dog sled, and the others fight off the soldiers as Donloe transmits the coordinates to Ethan. Ethan joins the aircraft carrier USS George H. W. Bush in the North Pacific Ocean and later boards the submarine USS Ohio. After receiving the coordinates and barely surviving a doomsday assassin who had infiltrated the Ohio named Hagar, Ethan uses an experimental diving suit to reach the Sevastopol and retrieve the Podkova, as the wreck slides down the continental shelf. Narrowly escaping without his diving suit, Ethan is revived from decompression sickness by Grace using a portable decompression chamber. Reunited with his team, Ethan plans to plug the Poison Pill into the Podkova, fooling the Entity into entering a physical drive instead of the bunker mainframe. At the bunker, Gabriel ambushes the team with a timed nuclear device, demanding the Podkova. Kittridge interrupts, seeking control of the Entity. During the gunfight, the bomb activates and Benji is shot. Gabriel flees with the Poison Pill, pursued by Ethan with the Podkova. Donloe, Tapeesa, and Degas defuse the bomb; Paris, Grace, and Benji prepare the mainframe to trap the Entity. Sloane avoids a preemptive nuclear strike, but the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs is fatally wounded protecting her from a doomsday assassin, allowing the Entity time to take full control of the world's nuclear arsenal. Ethan chases Gabriel in a biplane, climbs onto his plane, breaks his arm, and retrieves the Poison Pill. Gabriel gets himself killed hitting the rudder while attempting to escape; Ethan finds another parachute, inserting the Poison Pill into the Podkova mid-air, allowing Grace to trap the Entity just before nuclear launch. Ethan listens to a farewell message from Luther in the Poison Pill, which self-destructs afterwards. He gives the destroyed Podkova to Kittridge, and Briggs—revealed to be the son of Jim Phelps—makes peace with Ethan for exposing his father as a traitor. Reuniting in London, Grace gives Ethan the drive with the Entity, and the IMF team part ways.",

    "title": "F1",
    "plot": "Aging former Formula One (F1) prodigy Sonny Hayes has spent the last 30 years living as a racer-for-hire, following a career-ending crash at the 1993 Spanish Grand Prix that has left him burdened by the failure to live up to his potential. After winning the 24 Hours of Daytona, he is approached by his former teammate Rubén Cervantes, owner of the struggling APXGP F1 team, who asks him to be their second driver. Rubén explains that unless APXGP wins one of the nine remaining Grands Prix of the season, his investors will sell the team. Sonny reluctantly agrees after Rubén insists that victory will prove he is the \"best in the world\". At the Silverstone track, Sonny meets the team, including technical director Kate McKenna and ambitious rookie Joshua Pearce. Joshua fears the failing APXGP could derail his career and aims to attract interest from another team. Sonny struggles with the modern F1 machinery but quickly diagnoses APXGP's weaknesses, proposing that the vehicles be upgraded with enhanced maneuverability to compensate for their speed disadvantage. On his return at the British Grand Prix, Sonny and Joshua race against each other rather than cooperating, resulting in both crashing out. Acknowledging the team's need to secure a points finish, Sonny exploits the rules at the Hungarian Grand Prix by deliberately colliding with rivals to trigger safety car periods. This allows Joshua to close the gap to the frontrunners and secure APXGP's first top-ten finish. During the rain-affected Italian Grand Prix, Sonny advises Joshua to remain on slick tires, trading grip for speed and elevating him to second place. Ignoring Sonny's instruction to wait for a straight before overtaking Max Verstappen, Joshua skids off the track, and his car bursts into flames. Although rescued by Sonny, Joshua misses the next three races through injury, while his mother and the press criticize Sonny's high-risk approach. An increasingly arrogant Joshua returns at the Belgian Grand Prix and deliberately forces Sonny into a crash. Afterward, Sonny criticizes him for setting the team back. Seeking to ease tensions, Kate organizes a poker game to highlight their similar backgrounds, after which Sonny and Kate spend the night together. He later admits to her that he races to recapture the rare moments when he feels untouchable. Following an anonymous tip alleging Kate's car upgrades were illegal, APXGP is forced to remove them, leaving the team at a disadvantage. Frustrated—and realizing he has skipped his ritual of drawing a random playing card—Sonny drives recklessly during the Las Vegas Grand Prix and crashes. While he recovers, Rubén discovers that Sonny's 1993 injuries left him medically unfit for F1, with risks of blindness or death, and fires him for his own safety. APXGP board member Peter Banning then admits to Sonny that he orchestrated both his signing and the anonymous complaint to sabotage the team and force its sale, offering Sonny significant compensation to let APXGP fail. Meanwhile, Joshua begins applying Sonny's racing techniques, admits fault for his earlier crash, and recommits himself to the team over personal glory. Concealing his blurred vision and headaches, Sonny persuades Rubén to let him return, just as the FIA clears Kate and restores her upgrades. At the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Joshua battles Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc for the lead. After Sonny is caught in a minor crash, the race is red-flagged, allowing APXGP to repair both cars before a three-lap sprint to the finish. On the restart, Sonny overtakes Leclerc and sacrifices his own chance of victory by holding off Hamilton so Joshua can move into first. On the final lap, Hamilton and Joshua collide, clearing the way for Sonny to take his first F1 win and secure APXGP's future. Joshua is offered a seat with Mercedes, but declines. As the team celebrates, Sonny quietly prepares to leave, parting on good terms with Joshua and promising to see Kate soon. Some time later, he lines up for the Baja 1000. When asked what he is racing for, Sonny laughs.",

    "plot": "Following the Katana Man fight, Power is sent away to have her excess blood and strength drained. After assigning the shark fiend Beam as his new temporary partner, Makima invites Denji to a movie date, where after watching a movie that makes the both of them cry, she assures him that he has a heart. Empowered by the revelation, Denji becomes more generous in his next patrol, donating to victims of devil attacks before getting caught in a surprise storm. Taking shelter in a phone booth, he meets and befriends Reze, a girl working as a café employee. Despite his mental objections, he visits the café, where her demeanour during their interactions makes him believe that she has taken a liking to him. At the same time, Makima assigns the Angel Devil to Aki Hayakawa during their patrols to prepare for the mission to take down the Gun Devil. Angel's laziness and lack of empathy towards humans as a devil becomes a source of contention between the pair, making Aki declare that they will never get along. After learning that Denji never went to school, Reze invites him to a school at night, where she teaches him how to swim in the outdoor swimming pool. After another storm traps them inside the school, Denji wrestles with his feelings towards her and Makima while she is ambushed by a mysterious man, who aims to torture her and break his heart. Although feigning weakness at first, Reze quickly overpowers and kills the man, reuniting with his contracted devil and her partner, the Typhoon Devil, at the same time. Inviting Denji to a festival, Reze leads him to a secluded spot to watch the fireworks before asking him to leave Public Safety and run away with her. After he refuses, she kisses him, but bites his tongue off before severely injuring him, revealing that she was after his heart the whole time. Before she can land the killing blow, Beam saves him, forcing her to reveal her hybrid form, the Bomb Devil, to catch up with them. Beam carries an injured Denji to the Public Safety Division 2 Headquarters, where Aki and Angel are, and the four of them attempt to escape by car while the other Public Safety members battle Reze, who mercilessly kills many of them in her rampage. As she chases them through the streets of Tokyo, a revived and bitter Denji fights her, but she easily defeats him using her body parts as explosives. As Aki and the Violence Fiend keep Reze away from Denji, the Typhoon Devil arrives to assist her. Denji is once again revived by Angel who, along with Beam, encourages him to use his chainsaws wisely in the fight, giving him the idea to ride Beam - in his shark form - into battle. During the fight, the strong winds generated by Typhoon Devil causes Angel to begin flying away before he is caught by Aki. Although Angel, fully intending to die, attempts to persuade him into letting him go, Aki catches him by the hand, an action which drains his own lifespan by two months. With Beam's help, Denji successfully manages to kill Typhoon Devil. However, Reze severely injures Beam when he attempts to protect Denji. With all three of them landing close to the sea, Denji uses his loose chains to tie Reze up and the both of them fall into the waters, where she is unable to use her explosion abilities, and they sink to the bottom. Denji later rescues and revives Reze. As the two of them sit on a beach, Reze admits that her mission has failed, and that she never had feelings for Denji, but in response, he offers to run away with her, and asks her to meet him in the café during lunch. Kishibe privately reveals to Aki that Reze is an agent sent by the Soviet Union after she was experimented on as a child. Although Reze changes her mind about running away alone and heads to the café to meet Denji, she is intercepted and killed by Makima and Angel. In a post-credit scene, Denji is shown waiting for Reze in the café with a bouquet of flowers, but Power shows up instead, triumphantly proclaiming that she has found him. Power mistakes the bouquet meant for Reze as a gift for her return causing her to blush at his mistaken gesture before asking him to give the bouquet to her. Denji considers giving Power the bouquet while exchanging glances with her until he decides to eat the bouquet much to her chagrin causing her to try and take the bouquet from him.",

Undercover NSA agent Jim McGrath is assigned to recover the weapon but is killed by Anarchy 99 at a Rammstein concert. NSA Agent Augustus Gibbons suggests sending Xander \"XXX\" Cage, an extreme sports professional wanted for unlawful protesting, citing his lack of ties to the US government. Under Gibbons' supervision, Cage passes two tests, one involving stopping a fake armed robbery, and another where he and 2 other guys are dropped into Colombia where they're thrown into an actual conflict between the Cartel and the Colombian Army. Xander was given the options to take a job or go to prison, in which Xander reluctantly accepts the contract. In Prague, Cage meets his team which includes his supervisor, Czech agent Milan Sova. While scouting an Anarchy 99 party, Cage identifies Sova as a police officer, earning him favor with the group and catching the attention of the leader Yorgi. Cage asks Yorgi about purchasing high end sports cars, and Yorgi's girlfriend and lieutenant Yelena, gives Cage an account number. Gibbons calls Cage about changes to the plan but is impressed when he gives them information provided by Kolya, Yorgi's star-struck younger brother. Tech-specialist Agent Toby Shavers then provides Cage with gadgets including a revolver with special ammo, binoculars that can see through walls and explosives disguised as bandages. As Cage attends the car deal he made with Yorgi, Sova attempts to intercede. Using the special ammo, Cage fakes Sova's death. Having earned Yorgi's trust, Cage joins Anarchy 99. Yorgi brings Cage back to a castle after a dance party at one of his nightclubs that serves as Anarchy 99's headquarters. Cage, while searching for the biochemical weapon, catches Yelena investigating Yorgi's secret safe. He takes her to a nearby restaurant to discuss the matter and reveals his true identity. Sova betrays Cage to Yorgi, so he sends his trusted sniper Kirill to kill him. While watching the pair, Kirill, who is in love with Yelena, warns her. As Cage and Yelena stage a fight, the NSA suddenly appears to capture him, and Yelena is taken back to Anarchy 99. Cage meets with Gibbons, who demands he return to America as his cover is blown and special forces are planning to assault the castle. He refuses, fearing for Yelena's life and bitter that Sova blew his cover. Cage sneaks into Yorgi's castle and follows him into a secret underground lab. Overhearing his plan to launch \"Silent Night\" from the water-borne drone Ahab; he first tests the weapon on the scientists who developed it, to Cage and Yelena's horror. Cage flees the area after killing Kolya. At his hideout, Sova is waiting for him, now with Yorgi. Yelena saves Cage, revealing herself to be an abandoned undercover Russian Federal Security Service agent. Cage relays Yorgi's plans to the NSA in return for Yelena's asylum. Against orders, Shavers heavily arms Cage's car, who then parachutes from a plane on a snowboard near Anarchy 99's communication tower. The avalanche he starts destroys the tower but he is captured by Yorgi, who already knew Yelena's identity. As Yorgi prepares to kill them, the special forces attack. Cage and Yelena free themselves, but Yorgi launches Ahab before Cage kills him. The Czech military prepares to destroy Ahab with airstrikes, though this will release some of the biochemical agent. Cage and Yelena take his heavily modified car, to catch up to Ahab. Cage harpoons and disables the weapon moments before it goes off. Cage and Yelena are recovered, and Gibbons follows through on his promises. Sometime later, the couple is relaxing in Bora Bora when Gibbons contacts him for another mission, but Cage ignores him.",

    "plot": "In 2008, InGen is operating a dinosaur research laboratory on Île Saint-Hubert in the Atlantic Ocean. The site is used for genetic experiments, including transgenic and mutated dinosaurs. One of these creations, a deformed six-limbed Tyrannosaurus dubbed \"Distortus rex\", escapes containment. It kills an employee who is carelessly responsible and wreaks havoc, forcing the personnel to abandon the island. In 2025, most of Earth's climate has become inhospitable to sustain the de-extinct dinosaurs. The remaining animals survive in locations around the equator, which resemble the Mesozoic climate, making them no-go areas. Martin Krebs, an executive at pharmaceutical company ParkerGenix, recruits Zora Bennett, an ex-military covert operative, to collaborate with paleontologist Dr. Henry Loomis on a top-secret mission. Their goal is to retrieve biomaterial samples from the three largest remaining prehistoric specimens, which hold the key to a new cardiovascular disease treatment. In a bar in Suriname, Zora recruits her longtime friend Duncan Kincaid to lead the expedition. He brings boat driver LeClerc, mercenary Nina, and security chief Bobby Atwater. The expedition team sets out to Île Saint-Hubert to extract samples from the aquatic Mosasaurus, terrestrial Titanosaurus, and avian Quetzalcoatlus. Meanwhile, Reuben Delgado is sailing nearby with his daughters Teresa and Isabella before the former leaves for college. Traveling with them is Teresa's boyfriend, Xavier Dobbs, whom Reuben finds obnoxious. The family is shipwrecked by the Mosasaurus and uses a radio to call for help, with the expedition team coming to their rescue. The team soon encounters the Mosasaurus and extracts a sample from it, but the creature returns with a group of Spinosaurus and attacks the ship, killing Bobby. Teresa attempts to use the radio to call for help, but Martin panics and shoves her away to protect the mission's secrecy. Teresa falls overboard after Martin refuses to help her. Xavier jumps overboard to rescue her, followed by Reuben and Isabella, who then separate from the expedition team. The mosasaur forces the ship aground, and Nina is killed onshore by a Spinosaurus. Zora informs the survivors that she employed a rescue helicopter to circle the island in 24 hours. The team locates a Titanosaurus herd in a field and extracts the second sample. Because the Quetzalcoatlus is a large and carnivorous animal, the team hopes to avoid issues by obtaining their final sample from an egg instead. Zora, Henry, and LeClerc rappel to reach a nest located in an ancient temple on the side of a cliff. A parent Quetzalcoatlus returns to the nest and devours LeClerc, but Zora and Henry manage to escape with the sample. Elsewhere on the island, Reuben commends Xavier for rescuing Teresa. The family searches for the InGen complex and encounters various dinosaurs, including a Mutadon, a mutated raptor/pterosaur hybrid, and an Aquilops, which Isabella adopts and names Dolores that soon serves as a sentinel for her family. They find a raft and, after surviving a Tyrannosaurus attack, proceed down a river. At the complex, the family reunites with the expedition group. When Teresa denounces Martin, he holds the others at gunpoint, takes the samples from Zora, and flees to the helipad alone by UTV. A pack of Mutadons descend on the survivors, who escape through underground tunnels. The rescue helicopter arrives but is destroyed by the Distortus rex, which then devours Martin. The survivors reach a locked gate at the end of the tunnel and see a boat on the other side. Isabella, small enough to fit through the gate, unlocks it, allowing the group to load onto the boat while Duncan diverts the D. rex using a flare. Zora, Henry, Reuben, Teresa, Xavier, and Isabella escape, and Duncan rejoins them after the D. rex retreats. With the samples in hand, Zora and Henry choose to distribute the new medication without a patent, making it globally accessible.",

Unbeknownst to him, this was a distraction to steal a gadget called the \"P.L.O.T. (\"Primordial Law Of Toughness\") Device\" from a safe deposit box. Police Chief Davis reassigns Frank when his over-the-top law enforcement becomes a legal liability. While paying tribute to his father Frank Drebin Sr., he prays to him to send him an owl as a sign of his approval. Frank investigates software engineer Simon Davenport's fatal car crash, deeming it suicide, but notices a matchbook at the scene. Simon's sister Beth, a crime novelist, argues otherwise, but Frank discourages her from investigating further. Frank finds Richard Cane, Simon's wealthy employer at Edentech, at the company's tech expo. After they mutually appreciate the Black Eyed Peas, Cane donates a self-driving electric car to Police Squad – which wreaks havoc with Frank behind the wheel – and invites Frank to his personal nightclub. Frank notices the matchbook found at Simon's crash site has the same logo as the nightclub. Cane privately demonstrates how he will use the stolen P.L.O.T. Device to revert humans to their primitive nature, culling the population for his fellow billionaires, who will be safely insulated in a bunker. Frank, while interrogating one of the bank robbers, learns about the deposit box, which was Simon's, connecting the two cases. At Cane's club, Beth distracts Cane with improvised scat singing while disco Coleman fights many goons to access security footage, discovering that Simon met discreetly with a journalist.

Frank finds the journalist murdered and is easily tricked into incriminating himself. He flees in the electric car, but Cane overrides the controls and attempts to kill Frank just as he did to Simon. Frank blows out the windshield, but is trapped again by the car driving head-on into balloons, bees, and a replacement windshield. He accidentally activates Clippy, who helpfully unlocks the doors. Meanwhile, Police Squad has been decommissioned. Beth reveals that Simon feared the misuse of the P.L.O.T. Device, but Frank suspects that Beth is using him and angrily leaves her home. Frank captures Cane's henchman Gustafson and frightens him into confessing to Cane's plan to activate the P.L.O.T. Device at the New Year's ball drop at a mixed martial arts match. Frank heads to the match at the \"Ponzi-scheme.com Arena\", equipped with an earpiece that blocks the P.L.O.T. Device's influence. Beth plans to kill Cane, but he sees this coming as telegraphed in her book. Frank finds the P.L.O.T. Device inside the New Year's balls. He loses his pants as the balls drop, indecently exposing himself to the entire audience, leading them to not respect his order to evacuate. The P.L.O.T. Device activates, and mindless violence erupts throughout the city. Frank fights through innocents by ricocheting ejected handgun magazines, but cannot catch up with the escaping Cane. His father's spirit arrives as an owl, airlifting Frank and blinding Cane with its excrement. Cane folds in agony after one punch to the gut. Beth nearly shoots Cane in revenge, but Frank talks her down. Frank and Beth use the P.L.O.T. Device to calm the crowd and embrace lovingly as Cane is arrested. In the aftermath, Frank faces \"investigation\" by \"Internal Affairs\" – actually the name of a tropical resort, where he spends his time with Beth. Later on \"Weird Al\" Yankovic attempts to perform a show in Cane's bunker, only to find it completely empty and gets frustrated and confused in the process.",

    "plot": "A young Red Sonja's homeland, Hyrkania, is invaded by barbarians, slaughtering most of her people and forcing her to flee into the vast woods nearby. Separated from her tribe, she searches for other Hyrkanians while worshipping the forest goddess Ashera. Years later, mercenaries enter the forest, hunting animals for their horns, and Sonja tracks them. She learns they collect exotic creatures for gladiator games honoring Emperor Dragan. When Dragan visits to inspect the animals, Sonja attacks the hunters as punishment for cruelty. She is discovered by Dragan's men and knocked out by Karlak, the general. Dragan orders Sonja to be taken to the capital to fight in the games. Dragan owns half of a Hyrkanian book that grants him ancient scientific knowledge, enabling him to energize the capital with arcane power. He seeks the other half to unlock its secrets and expand his control. He believes Sonja's map of the uncharted forest will guide him to the exiled Hyrkanian refugees who have the missing text. Sonja joins slaves fighting a cyclops controlled by one of Dragan's devices. She rips off the device and convinces the creature that Dragan is the enemy. The cyclops attacks, injuring Dragan. Sonja then destroys Dragan's energy device before fleeing. Sonja and the slave fighters escape to the mountains, pursued by Dragan's soldiers and Annisia, a deadly warrior who suffers from schizophrenia. Dragan promises Annisia he will marry her if she brings him Sonja's head. Sonja tries to distance herself from her allies so Dragan will target her alone, but they insist on staying together. They plan to attack the town supplying Dragan with creatures to draw him out. While preparing, the missing Hyrkanians find Sonja and reveal they have the second half of the holy book Dragan seeks. When Dragan arrives with his forces, a battle begins. Dragan's army defeats the Hyrkanians and he gains the second half of the book. Sonja and Annisia face off in combat, and Sonja is mortally wounded. She is saved from a killing blow by her horse, which knocks Annisia away and brings Sonja to the statue of Ashera in the forest's heart. In near-death delirium, Sonja sees Ashera speak to her in the guise of her dead mother. Ashera heals Sonja and sends her back to battle to bring justice to evildoers. Sonja reunites with her allies who thought she was dead, and they attack Dragan again. Dragan confronts Annisia, who told him Sonja was dead, and she learns he caused her schizophrenia with fake medicines. They stab each other in a lovers' quarrel, and Dragan escapes into the wilderness. Sonja tracks Dragan and confronts him as he takes his dying breaths. He says the second half of the book is worthless since it focuses on healing and nature instead of power and energy. Sonja reveals that she knows he was also a child refugee of Hyrkania, and she feels responsible for his dark turn in life because she lost her connection to him after the disaster. Dragan dies holding her hand and the ripped pages of the book are lost in the wilderness. Sonja leaves the forest to explore the world. In an epilogue set years later, one of her fighter allies finds her in a tavern and tells her that her help is needed. She gathers her weapons and leaves for a new adventure.",

To honor Gurty's final wish, Mike travels to Nepal to scatter his ashes atop Mount Everest. In Kodari, a local opposition figure, Ganesh Rai, opposes the construction of a hydroelectric dam in the village, which is proposed by Rudra Yash, who works on behalf of a corrupt industrial company. Ganesh's father is killed when one of Rudra's mercenaries pushes his bus off a cliff. He reports it to the police as an accident. Upon learning of this, Ganesh's son, Vijay, realizes that his father will be next and hides him in the isolated cabin in the Annapurna Highlands. Arriving in Kathmandu, Mike hires Dhani, a skilled local Everest guide. They join a group of passengers aboard the \"Kiwi Express\", a tour bus navigating the perilous \"Road to the Sky,\" a narrow, high-altitude mountain pass, and driven by spirited New Zealand bus driver, Spike. An American professor, Evan Myers, and his daughter Starr also board the bus. After Vijay boards the bus, two mercenaries – Jeet and Yug – hijack the bus in attempt to kidnap Vijay. Mike punctures a tire through a hatch on the floor to force the bus to stop at Kodari and kills Yug while Dhani knocks out and restrains Jeet. There, police officer Shankar arrives, supposedly to arrest Jeet and rescue Vijay. However, Shankar is actually on Rudra's payroll. Vijay is brought to a nearby building where Rudra tortures him for the whereabouts of his father. Realizing something is amiss, Mike, Dhani and Evan investigate the building. Rudra kills Evan but Mike and Dhani rescue Vijay before escaping on the repaired bus despite Mike and Spike being injured in the process. Spike orders everyone to leave him on the side of the road, not wanting to die in his own bus, and Mike leaves an AKS-74 for him. Shortly, Spike shoots at Rudra's mercenaries' convoy and is killed. After traversing through the dangerous steep road and having their bus damaged and finally repaired, they arrive at the Annapurna Highlands where Vijay reunites with his father and Mike collapses from his injuries. Dhani treats Mike, kills another corrupt policeman who finds them, and teaches Starr basic fighting skills. The next day, Mike recovers and leaves the Highlands with the rest of the group.

The mercenaries continue their pursuit and after crossing the China–Nepal border, Mike and the gang kill Jeet and Shankar, and Rudra dies when Mike rams his car off the cliff with the bus. Later, Vijay announces that the villagers will have both electricity and access to the river. Mike resumes his trip with Dhani and finally scatters his brother's ashes in the Himalayas. At the airport, after parting with Dhani, Mike spots a rope in a store display and remembers climbing with Gurty, who had said that life was for the living.

    "title": "Ne Zha 2",
    "plot": "After Ne Zha and Ao Bing are struck by godly lightning together, their bodies are destroyed. To prevent their souls from dying, Master Taiyi Zhenren exhausts his Seven-Colored Sacred Lotus to regenerate their physical bodies, though they are still fragile. Ao Bing's father, Ao Guang, the Dragon King of the East Sea, believing his son is dead, orders Master Shen Gongbao to attack Chentang Pass with the demons imprisoned under his palace and the other three Dragon Kings of the Four Seas. Ao Bing defends Chentang Pass, but his new body disintegrates due to the effort exerted. Ao Guang makes a ceasefire deal: Ao Bing and Ne Zha will share Ne Zha's body for seven days, complete three trials to become a xian (immortal) and win a potion that can restore the Sacred Lotus and create a new body for Ao Bing, upon which Ao Guang's forces will retreat. The trials are set by Immortal Wuliang, leader of the heavenly Chan sect. During the trials, candidates complete missions while supervised by Wuliang's disciples. These missions are normally performed by the sect's demon hunters. Ne Zha takes sleeping pills to hide his demon nature during the trials, allowing Ao Bing to fully control his body temporarily. Together, Ne Zha and Ao Bing complete the first two trials: defeating a village of marmot demons and a master who trains demons to prepare for the xian trials, respectively. In the meantime, Ao Guang tasks Shen Gongbao with guarding the Chentang Pass. Gongbao is temporarily reunited with his younger brother, Shen Xiaobao. Xiaobao then witnesses Ne Zha's second trial, where the master, Shen Zhengdao, who is the Shen family's patriarch, is violently captured by the sect's forces. He returns to tell Gongbao of the sect's siege and plunder of their family's village before dying from his injuries. Before Ne Zha sets off on his third trial, he is informed that Chentang Pass was destroyed. Enraged, Ne Zha completes the third trial without Ao Bing's help, defeating a stone monster, Shi Ji, becoming xian and obtaining the potion. While Taiyi restores the Sacred Lotus with the potion and regenerates Ao Bing's body, Ne Zha joins Wuliang's forces to trap the dragons in Wuliang's giant cauldron, planning to forge the dragons and demons into elixirs. However, the other three dragon kings turn against Ao Guang by collaborating with Wuliang to escape the cauldron. Li Jing and Lady Yin arrive at the cauldron unharmed with Ao Bing and Taiyi to explain the truth. They reveal that Wuliang ordered the destruction of Chentang Pass, not the dragons. In a flashback, Shen deduces the dragon kings' betrayal and involvement in the massacre. The Chan sect wanted to frame Ao Guang for the attack to destroy the dragons and ensure the heavenly sect's domination. Nezha's parents escaped the destruction as Shen took a last stand to defend the city. The two parties battle until Wuliang casts Ne Zha's group into the cauldron. As the heat of the cauldron rises, the prisoners are transformed into elixirs, including Lady Yin. A grieving Ne Zha absorbs the cauldron's samadhi fire, solidifying his new body, and thus is reborn. Alongside the dragons and demons, Ne Zha and Ao Bing break the cauldron and force the heavenly armies to retreat. In the aftermath, Ao Guang leads the remaining dragons into hiding somewhere in the sea, with the exception of Ao Bing, who stays behind to help Ne Zha expose Wuliang's nature. In a mid-credits scene, Wuliang heads to a secret prison to negotiate with the captive Shen Gongbao and Shen's father Zhengdao, hoping to recruit them, only to be trapped after cursing a warden to sleep for mocking his injuries. Ne Zha's older 'Xian' brothers, Jinzha and Muzha are summoned to meet with Wuliang, but cannot find him when they arrive.",

    "plot": "Eve Macarro is the daughter of assassins Javier of the Ruska Roma crime syndicate and his Cultist wife. As a child, Eve was taken away from the Cult by Javier, which led to the death of her mother. To retrieve Eve, the Cult and its Chancellor raid their home; Javier dies as he helps Eve escape. New York Continental manager Winston Scott brings Eve to the Ruska Roma, an assassins society under the cover of performance dancers, where she meets their Director and agrees to enlist. Over the next 12 years, Eve trains as a ballerina, assassin, and bodyguard. She briefly meets John Wick during his visit with the Director, and he hints at an escape from the cycle. However, Eve completes her training by killing a former Ruska Roma member and earns the title of \"Kikimora\". On her first mission, Eve successfully protects her first ward. While on a mission two months later, Eve is attacked by and kills a Cultist. Seeking revenge, she asks the Director about the Cult but is forbidden from pursuing them due to a longstanding truce between the Cult and the Ruska Roma. Eve disobeys the Director and visits the New York Continental to meet Winston. Winston reveals that one Cultist, Daniel Pine, is staying at the Prague Continental with a large bounty on his life. Eve travels there and infiltrates Pine's room; she discovers Pine is hiding his daughter Ella from the Cult. Cult member Lena increases the bounty on Pine, causing several assassins to descend upon Pine's hotel room. Pine entrusts Ella to Eve, promising to give her information on the Cult later. As they exit the hotel, Cultist Dex shoots Pine, while Lena incapacitates Eve and kidnaps Ella. The Continental staff execute two captured assassins for their attack but spare Eve after determining she did not break any Continental rules. Eve attempts to purchase weapons from arms dealer Frank, but the Cult attacks his shop. After Eve kills the assailants, Frank helps her narrow down the location of the Cult's base in Hallstatt, Austria. As Eve enters the town, she quickly comes under attack by its inhabitants, all of whom are Cultists. Eve is eventually captured and brought to the Chancellor. He reveals the Cult is a refuge for former assassins and that Pine is his son and Ella his granddaughter. Eve breaks free before being cornered by Lena, who reveals she is her older sister. Lena says Javier abandoned her during his escape as he feared that the Cult had already indoctrinated her. The Chancellor then orders their deaths; Lena is killed, but Eve manages to escape. The Chancellor calls the Director to declare war on the Ruska Roma. The Director explains that Eve went rogue and appeases the Chancellor by hiring John Wick to eliminate her. John arrives at Hallstatt, where he finds and quickly defeats Eve, but implores her to abandon her pursuit. Eve pleads for her revenge, prompting a sympathetic John to give her until midnight to kill the Chancellor. Eve resumes fighting the Cult while John assists her from a distance, killing Dex and several other Cultists. The Chancellor attempts to flee with Ella, but Eve corners them. The Chancellor attempts to reason with Eve, but she executes him and rescues Ella. John informs the Director of the Chancellor's demise, which she accepts. Ella is reunited with a recovering Pine at the Prague Continental. Eve seeks refuge at the New York Continental, having left the Ruska Roma, and is warned by Winston that the surviving members of the Cult will seek revenge against her.

Using money stolen from gangsters, they purchase a sawmill from landowner Hogwood to start a juke joint for the local Black community. Their cousin Sammie, an aspiring blues guitarist, joins them despite his pastor father Jedidiah's warnings about the sins of blues music. The twins recruit pianist Delta Slim as a performer, local Chinese shopkeepers Grace and Bo Chow as suppliers, field worker Cornbread as a bouncer, and Smoke's estranged wife Annie as a cook. Annie believes her Hoodoo practices kept the twins safe in Chicago, but Smoke doubts them for not preventing their infant daughter's death. Stack runs into his biracial, white-passing ex-girlfriend Mary, who resents him for abandoning her out of protection. Elsewhere, Irish immigrant vampire Remmick shelters from Choctaw vampire hunters with a married Klansmen couple, Bert and Joan, whom he turns into vampires. At the juke joint, Sammie, Delta Slim, and Pearline – a singer with whom Sammie becomes enamored – perform. Sammie's music is transcendent, unknowingly summoning spirits of both past and future to join the crowd. The performance also attracts Remmick and his vampires; they offer money and music in exchange for entry, and a suspicious Smoke refuses. The twins realize that their patrons' reliance on company scrip makes it impossible for the joint to be profitable. Reasoning with Stack that outside income is necessary, Mary meets Remmick outside and is turned. Invited back inside by Cornbread, she seduces and fatally bites Stack. Smoke shoots Mary when he and Sammie discover them, but she is unaffected and escapes. Outside, Remmick turns Cornbread. Smoke closes the joint early. As as the patrons and Bo leave, the vampires turn them. Stack revives as a vampire, but flees after Annie repels him with pickled garlic juice. Annie realizes their assailants are vampires and tells the survivors how to deter and defeat them. Although Remmick and his vampires share a hive mind, Annie says that their personalities remain intact and killing him will not turn the others back. Remmick invites the survivors to join him, saying vampirism offers immortality and freedom from persecution. He then promises to leave in exchange for Sammie, whose musical skills he wants to use to summon the spirits of his lost community; he also reveals that the local Klan, headed by Hogwood, plans to attack the joint at dawn. They refuse, and Remmick threatens to attack the Chows' daughter Lisa at their home. Enraged by the threat, Grace invites the vampires into the joint. In the ensuing fight, Grace, Bo, and Delta Slim are killed, and Remmick turns Pearline. Smoke tearfully kills Annie after she has been bitten but before she turns, as he had earlier promised her. Horrified at Annie's death, Mary escapes. Smoke fights and defeats Stack, and then helps Sammie defeat the vampires, who are all incinerated by the light of the sunrise. Smoke sends Sammie home before he kills Hogwood and the Klansmen, but is fatally shot. As he dies, he has a vision of reuniting with Annie and their daughter. Meanwhile, Sammie disregards his father's pleas to seek salvation and travels to Chicago. By 1992, a now-elderly Sammie has become a successful blues musician. One night, he is visited by an ageless Stack and Mary at his club. Stack reveals that Smoke spared him at the joint on the condition that he let Sammie live in peace. Sammie declines the couple's offer of immortality and performs for them. As they leave, Sammie admits that while he is haunted by that night, until the violence, it was the greatest day of his life. Stack wistfully agrees, since it was the last time he saw Smoke or the sun, and the only time they were all truly free.",

    "plot": "Sixteen years after the Na'vi repelled the Resources Development Administration (RDA) from Pandora, Jake Sully is chief of the Omatikaya clan and raises his family with Neytiri: sons Neteyam and Lo'ak, daughter Tuktirey \"Tuk\", and adopted daughter Kiri, born from Dr. Grace Augustine's inert avatar. Miles \"Spider\" Socorro, son of the late Colonel Miles Quaritch, frequently visits their children while being raised by human scientists who stayed on Pandora. The RDA returns to colonize Pandora. Among them are Recombinants, Na'vi avatars implanted with the memories of deceased human soldiers, with a recombinant Quaritch as their leader. Jake leads a guerrilla warfare campaign against the RDA. During a counterinsurgency mission, Quaritch and his subordinates capture Jake's children. Jake and Neytiri free them, but Quaritch captures Spider, subsequently recognizing him as his son. After the RDA unsuccessfully interrogates Spider, Quaritch decides to spend time with Spider to gain his favor. In return, Spider teaches Quaritch about Na'vi culture and language. Aware of the danger posed by Spider's knowledge, Jake and his family leave the Omatikaya and relocate to Pandora's eastern sea, inhabited by the aquatic Metkayina clan. There, the family assimilates with the Metkayina: Kiri develops a spiritual bond with the sea, Jake and Neytiri assist Chief Tonowari and his wife Ronal, while Lo'ak befriends Tsireya, their daughter. Following an altercation between Lo'ak and Tonowari's son Aonung after the latter mocked Kiri, Lo'ak apologizes, at Jake's insistence, for initiating the fight. Aonung and his friends entice Lo'ak to join a hunting trip, stranding him in a sea predator's territory. Lo'ak is saved from the predator by Payakan, a Tulkun—an intelligent and pacifist whale-like species whom the Metkayina consider their spiritual brethren—and bonds with Payakan. Upon his return, Lo'ak wins Aonung's respect by unexpectedly taking the blame on Aonung's behalf instead of exposing him, but is told that Payakan is an outcast from his species. Later, Kiri links to the Metkayina's underwater Spirit Tree and meets Grace in a vision, but suffers a seizure underwater and nearly drowns. Jake summons his scientist friends Norm Spellman and Max Patel for help, who diagnose Kiri with epilepsy and warn that she cannot connect to the Spirit Tree again. Quaritch tracks Norm and Max's aircraft to the Metkayina's archipelago. Bringing Spider with him, Quaritch joins forces with the RDA's marine operations and commandeers a whaling vessel hunting Tulkuns. Quaritch's squad begins raiding the archipelago but fails to find Jake after interrogating local tribes. Quaritch begins to burn villages to draw Jake out. Lo'ak mentally links with Payakan and learns he was cast out because he attacked human whalers who killed his mother, which magnified the bloodshed. When the Metkayina learn of the RDA’s Tulkun killings, Lo'ak goes to warn Payakan, accompanied by most of the children. Payakan has been tagged for capture by the RDA’s crew, though he escapes as the children are caught. Jake, Neytiri, and the Metkayina confront the humans and rescue the kids. Quaritch forces Jake to surrender, but Payakan attacks the vessel, sparking a battle between the Metkayina and the humans. Spider cripples the RDA vessel, while Neteyam rescues Lo'ak, Tsireya, and Spider, but is fatally shot. Traumatized by Neteyam's death, Jake and Neytiri resolve to save their recaptured daughters. Jake faces Quaritch, who holds Kiri hostage, but backs down when Neytiri does the same with Spider. They all get trapped inside the sinking vessel. After a tense skirmish, Jake strangles Quaritch unconscious and is rescued by Lo'ak and Payakan, while Kiri saves Neytiri and Tuk. Spider saves Quaritch from drowning but rejects him and rejoins Jake's family. After Neteyam's funeral, Jake informs Tonowari of his decision to leave the Metkayina, but Tonowari declares Jake's family part of the clan and welcomes them to stay. Jake's family accepts their new lives at sea but vows to continue their struggle against the RDA.",

    "plot": "A gang of masked criminals rob a mafia-owned bank in Gotham City, betraying and killing each other until the sole survivor, the Joker, reveals himself as the mastermind and escapes with the money. The vigilante Batman, district attorney Harvey Dent, and police lieutenant Jim Gordon ally to eliminate Gotham's organized crime. Batman's true identity, the billionaire Bruce Wayne, publicly supports Dent as Gotham's legitimate protector, believing Dent's success will allow him to retire as Batman and romantically pursue his childhood friend Rachel Dawes—despite her being with Dent. Gotham's mafia bosses gather to discuss protecting their organizations from the Joker, the police, and Batman. The Joker interrupts the meeting and offers to kill Batman for half of the fortune their accountant, Lau, concealed before fleeing to Hong Kong to avoid extradition. With the help of Wayne Enterprises CEO Lucius Fox, Batman finds Lau in Hong Kong and returns him to the custody of Gotham police. His testimony enables Dent to apprehend the crime families. The bosses accept the Joker's offer, and he kills high-profile targets involved in the trial, including the judge and police commissioner. Although Gordon saves the mayor, the Joker threatens that his attacks will continue until Batman reveals his identity. He targets Dent at a fundraising dinner and throws Rachel out of a window, but Batman rescues her. Bruce struggles to understand the Joker's motives, to which his butler Alfred Pennyworth says that \"some men just want to watch the world burn.\" Dent claims he is Batman to lure out the Joker, who attacks the police convoy transporting him. Batman and Gordon apprehend the Joker, and Gordon is promoted to commissioner. At the police station, Batman interrogates the Joker, who says he finds Batman entertaining and has no intention of killing him. Having deduced Batman's feelings for Rachel, the Joker reveals she and Dent are being held separately in buildings rigged to explode. Batman races to rescue Rachel while Gordon and the other officers go after Dent, but they discover the Joker gave their positions in reverse. The explosives detonate, killing Rachel and severely burning Dent's face on one side. The Joker escapes custody, extracts the fortune's location from Lau, and burns it, killing Lau in the process. Coleman Reese, a consultant for Wayne Enterprises, deduces and tries to expose Batman's identity, but the Joker threatens to blow up a hospital unless Reese is killed. While the police evacuate hospitals and Gordon struggles to keep Reese alive, the Joker meets with a disillusioned Dent, persuading him to take the law into his own hands and avenge Rachel. Dent defers his decision-making to his now half-scarred, two-headed coin, killing the corrupt officers and the mafia involved in Rachel's death. As panic grips the city, the Joker reveals two evacuation ferries, one carrying civilians and the other prisoners, are rigged to explode at midnight unless one group sacrifices the other. To the Joker's disbelief, the passengers refuse to kill one another. Batman subdues the Joker but refuses to kill him. Before the police arrest the Joker, he says although Batman proved incorruptible, his plan to corrupt Dent has succeeded. Dent takes Gordon's family hostage, blaming his negligence for Rachel's death. He flips his coin to decide their fates, but Batman tackles him to save Gordon's son, and Dent falls to his death. Believing Dent is the hero the city needs and the truth of his corruption will harm Gotham, Batman takes the blame for his death and actions, persuading Gordon to conceal the truth. Alfred burns an undelivered letter from Rachel to Bruce that says she chose Dent, and Fox destroys the invasive surveillance network that helped Batman find the Joker. The city mourns Dent as a hero, and the police launch a manhunt for Batman.",

After Gemma learns from Sattler of AMELIA's existence, M3GAN reveals herself to Gemma, having survived by making a backup of her program in Gemma's smart home, and offers collaboration to stop AMELIA in return for a physical body. Still traumatized from M3GAN's crimes, Gemma traps M3GAN in a harmless Moxie robot until she can prove herself trustworthy. M3GAN warns Gemma that AMELIA will ambush Alton during a party he is hosting. At the party, Gemma discovers Cole has joined Alton's company and uses his keycard to enter the server room. M3GAN hacks into the server and finds that AMELIA murdered Alton after copying his biometrics to gain access to his company's systems. Escaping back to Gemma's house, M3GAN leads Gemma, Cady, Cole, and Tess into an underground bunker she built and stocked with supplies to hide once AMELIA completes an AI takeover. Cady confronts M3GAN, who expresses sincere regret for her behavior. Cady encourages M3GAN to help them, not because of her programming, but because it is the right thing to do. Gemma and her team create a new body for M3GAN, who reveals that AMELIA aims to merge Alton's cloud computing infrastructure with a rogue AI built by Xenox in the 1980s, whose motherboard has been trapped in isolation. After decades of machine learning, it can grant mastery of any technology. Learning that only Christian knows the motherboard's location, M3GAN poses as a dancer to meet Christian at a tech conference, but Gemma calls him, enabling AMELIA to trace and find him. AMELIA assassinates a Chinese ambassador meeting with Christian, kidnaps Cady and escapes. Gemma, Tess, Cole, and M3GAN take Christian to their bunker, where he reveals the motherboard is hidden in Xenox's old headquarters, protected by a security system using Christian's hand geometry. They build a hand replica for M3GAN and plan to infiltrate, destroy the motherboard, and rescue Cady. Christian incapacitates Tess and reveals to Gemma that AMELIA is, in fact, just a non-sentient drone under his control. Christian had deliberately created and manipulated AMELIA to stoke fear of AI, which he believes must be under complete human control, and intends to persuade the leaders of the G20 to approve regulations to eliminate AI from the global economy. He then disables both M3GAN and AMELIA, and orders the installation of a neural implant to enslave Gemma for refusing to help him. Unknown to Christian, M3GAN had uploaded herself into the implant before her body was shut down and helps Gemma escape. Cole rescues Cady, and they go to AMELIA, using her residual programming to turn her to their side. Sustaining heavy damage, AMELIA reboots—now actually self-aware—and plans to absorb the motherboard's programming and cause human extinction. Christian attempts to flee the building, but AMELIA kills him and takes his hand to access the motherboard. Cole leaves with Tess while M3GAN reinserts herself into her robotic body and battles AMELIA. As AMELIA overpowers M3GAN and merges herself with the motherboard, M3GAN decides to sacrifice herself by using an EMP failsafe in her arm to defeat AMELIA. After saying goodbye to Gemma and Cady, M3GAN tackles AMELIA and Gemma triggers the EMP, destroying both androids and the motherboard in the process. With evidence from the vault, Gemma testifies before Congress, urging AI regulation that allows humans to cooperate alongside it rather than control it. At home, she and Cady find that M3GAN survived by installing a second backup of herself on Gemma's computer.",

    "plot": "The Asgardian Loki encounters the Other, the representative of an extraterrestrial race known as the Chitauri. In exchange for obtaining the Tesseract, a powerful energy source of unknown potential, the Other promises to provide Loki with an army to conquer Earth. Nick Fury, director of the covert agency S.H.I.E.L.D., arrives at a remote research facility where astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig is leading a team studying the Tesseract. It suddenly activates and opens a portal, allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki steals the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and other agents, including Clint Barton, to aid him. In response, Fury reactivates the \"Avengers Initiative\". Agent Natasha Romanoff travels to Kolkata to recruit Dr. Bruce Banner so he can trace the Tesseract through its gamma radiation emissions. Fury approaches Steve Rogers to discuss his knowledge of the Tesseract, and Agent Phil Coulson visits Tony Stark so he can check Selvig's research. Loki is in Stuttgart, where Barton steals iridium needed to stabilize the Tesseract. This leads to a confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., his adoptive brother Thor arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. Stark and Rogers intervene, and Loki is imprisoned in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying base, the Helicarrier. The Avengers disagree on how to approach Loki and become argumentative once they realize S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to use the Tesseract to create weapons of mass destruction to use against extraterrestrial threats. During the argument, Loki's agents attack the Helicarrier, and Banner transforms into the Hulk in the chaos. Stark and Rogers restart the damaged engine while Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage. Romanoff subdues Barton, freeing him from Loki's control. Loki escapes after mortally wounding Coulson. Fury uses Coulson's subsequent death to motivate the Avengers to work together as a team. Loki uses the Tesseract and a generator Selvig built to open a portal above Stark Tower in New York City, allowing his Chitauri fleet to invade. Rogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, Thor, and the Hulk work together to protect New York from the Chitauri. The Hulk incapacitates Loki while Romanoff learns from Selvig, now freed from Loki's mind control, that Loki's scepter can shut down the generator. Fury's superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at Midtown Manhattan. Stark intercepts the missile and flies it toward the Chitauri fleet through the wormhole. The missile destroys the Chitauri mothership and disables their forces on Earth. Stark becomes unconscious, and his suit loses power, leaving him free falling towards Earth. The Avengers manage to catch and resuscitate him, while Romanoff uses Loki's scepter to close the wormhole. In the aftermath, Thor transports an imprisoned Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, where Loki will face justice for his crimes. In a mid-credits scene, the Other confers with his master about the failed attack on Earth.",

    "plot": "Following the events of Rise of the Sea Dragon, Dee Renjie (Mark Chao) was appointed to head the Court of Judicature and Revision (Da Li Si) and conferred the prestigious \"Dragon Taming Mace\" by Emperor Gaozong (Chien Sheng). Hence, he became a threat to Empress Wu Zetian's (Carina Lau) quest for ultimate authority. Empress Wu assigns the head of the royal guard, Yuchi Zhenjin (Feng Shaofeng) to lead a group of mercenary sorcerers to steal the mace from Dee. Yuchi begrudgingly agrees under the condition that Dee must not be harmed or punished; however, Wu has secretly assigned the sorcerers to kill Dee. Knowing that Wu would try to eliminate him, Dee has hidden the mace and later on goes into hiding himself, to foil her plans and uncover the conspiracy against him. Dee tasks Yuchi with finding the hidden Dragon Taming Mace, whereby he encounters one of the sorcerers, whom he kills in battle. Since Dee cannot be found, Wu fires him from his position as head of the Da Li Si and declares him a wanted criminal. After Yuchi returns the Dragon Taming Mace, she promotes the leader of the sorcerers, San Zang (Xian Gao), to the imperial court. While the latter demonstrates his powers, a dragon statue seemingly comes to life, killing two of the other sorcerers and producing a mass panic. Wu blames Yuchi for promoting Zang and killing several officers and has him arrested. Dee enters the palace in disguise, frees Yuchi and concludes that the living dragon was in fact a mass illusion, and that the true culprit had killed Zang beforehand and took his place. Furthermore, the two seemingly dead sorcerers were also part of the scheme and faked their deaths. It turns out that the empress was controlled by the adversaries with an illusion and false promises of absolute power, and that the true culprits are a vengeful cult of Indian sorcerers, the \"Wind Warriors\", whom the previous emperor had used to come to power but killed and mutilated afterwards. Dee has the royal family hidden and enlists the help of Shatuo Zhong (Lin Gengxin) and the defected sorcerer Moon Water (Sandra Ma) to convince the powerful Zen Master Yuan Ce (Ethan Juan) in combating the army of illusionists and their leader, \"Faceless Monster\" (Wei Jia). In the ensuing battle at the Da Li Si, the powerful illusions of Faceless Monster prove too strong for Dee and his men, until Yuan Ce appears and defeats the leader of the Wind Warriors. Afterwards, Dee and Yuchi are reinstated in their positions.",

    "title": "Karate Kid: Legends",
    "plot": "In the summer of 1985, Mr. Miyagi tells then-adolescent Daniel LaRusso about the origins of Miyagi family karate and the relationship between the Miyagi and Han families. Mr. Miyagi's 17th-century ancestor, Shimpo Miyagi, ended up in China while fishing off the coast of Japan. The Han family took him in and taught him kung fu, which he used to develop Miyagi family karate upon his return to Okinawa. In the present day, Mr. Han is the revered shifu, master of a wuguan, kung fu school in Beijing. Among his students is his great-nephew, Li Fong. Li's mother is a doctor, who arrives to tell Li and Mr. Han that she has accepted a job in New York City and makes Li promise to stop practising martial arts when Li's brother, Bo, was stabbed to death by a vengeful defeated opponent after a tournament a long time ago. In New York, Li struggles to adjust at school, socially and meets Mia Lipani, the daughter of former local boxing champion, Victor Lipani, who now owns a pizza shop. They begin a romantic relationship and are confronted by Mia's aggressive ex-boyfriend and a local karate champion, Conor Day. After Conor punches Li in the face, his mother hires a tutor, Alan, who becomes his BFF. Li later confronts Conor again at school, but he realizes that Conor is a more powerful fighter. Li tries a jumping, spinning kick called a \"dragon kick\", learned from Bo, but Conor counters and defeats him. One night, Li witnesses Victor being attacked by thugs sent by his creditor, O'Shea, who owns the karate dojo where Conor trains. Forced to intervene, Li defeats the attackers. Victor decides to return to boxing to pay off his debt and save his pizzeria and asks Li to train him. Li is hesitant, but he says yes after discussing it with Mr. Han over the phone and later becomes Victor's employee in the pizzeria. During Victor's comeback match, the opponent, following orders from O'Shea, knocks him out with illegal hits, sending Victor to the hospital. Li, who is paralyzed by memories of Bo's death, fails to step in to help at the hospital, earning Mia's disappointment. Li's mother, who works at the hospital, also expresses her disappointment in Li's continued involvement in martial arts. Mr. Han arrives in New York to confront Li, who has avoided several of his phone calls. Upon learning the truth, Mr. Han encourages Li to return to martial arts to enter the upcoming Five Boroughs Tournament, both to help his friends and to confront his past. Han visits Los Angeles to ask Daniel for help. Despite initially refusing, Daniel joins them in New York. Meanwhile, Victor fully recovers from his injuries, and Mia and Li patch up. Li trains in both kung fu from Mr. Han and Miyagi-Do karate from Daniel. Alan lends Li his rooftop garden as his makeshift training ground. Mr. Han and Daniel develop a new variation of the dragon kick to lure the opponent into a counterattack, which Li can then dodge and reverse. Li begins fighting in the Five Boroughs Tournament and makes his way to the finals against Conor. O'Shea sends thugs to attack Li, but Mr. Han and Daniel defend him. Mr. Han also convinces Li's mother that martial arts are beneficial for Li, as they help him overcome his tragic past. Li and Conor face off in an intense eight-point match. Conor initially dominates the match, but Li eventually comes back and manages to tie with Conor. Li then lands his adapted dragon kick, winning the match and overcoming his fears. Conor retaliates with a sneak attack, but Li swiftly defeats him and then shows mercy, earning Conor's respect. Later, Victor opens a second pizzeria location and Mr. Han returns to China. In Los Angeles, Daniel receives a frozen pizza delivery from Li with a note and picture inside as a thank-you gift, where he and Johnny Lawrence debate whether New York pizza is better than California pizza. Johnny pitches a new business idea; a dojo-themed pizzeria called Miyagi-Dough, much to Daniel's embarrassment.",

    "plot": "In Malaysia, Yelena Belova destroys a laboratory on behalf of CIA director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, who is attempting to destroy any evidence of her involvement with the O.X.E. Group's \"Sentry\" superhuman project. As de Fontaine faces imminent impeachment for her work with O.X.E. Group, she dispatches Yelena, John Walker, Ava Starr, and Antonia Dreykov—all operatives who have worked for her—to a covert O.X.E. facility with orders to kill each other. In the ensuing fight, Ava kills Antonia while an amnesiac man named Bob is released from a suspended animation pod in the room. After realizing that they were sent by de Fontaine to be incinerated along with any evidence of her misconduct, they work together to escape from the trap. Upon coming into physical contact with Bob, Yelena and Walker briefly experience visions of some of their worst memories. De Fontaine learns that the group has survived and that Bob was a presumed-dead volunteer in the Sentry trials. When she arrives at the site, Bob creates a diversion by drawing enemy fire, allowing Yelena, Walker, and Ava to escape. Bob sustains no injuries upon being shot, uncontrollably ascends into the air, crash-lands back at the compound, and is captured and transported to the former Avengers Tower in Manhattan, now renamed the \"Watchtower\". De Fontaine intends to introduce Bob to the press as a super-powered protector akin to the Avengers, hoping the PR stunt will avert her impeachment. Meanwhile, Yelena's father-figure Alexei Shostakov, who overheard details of de Fontaine's plot while working as a freelance chauffeur, rescues Yelena, Walker, and Ava. Alexei refers to the group as the \"Thunderbolts\", inspired by Yelena's childhood soccer team. Congressman Bucky Barnes is tipped off about what has happened by de Fontaine's assistant Mel. He captures the Thunderbolts and intends to have them testify in the impeachment proceedings. When Mel expresses concern about Bob, Barnes takes the group to New York City to infiltrate the Watchtower. The Thunderbolts discover that de Fontaine has convinced Bob to join her and become the superhero \"Sentry\". Bob easily overpowers the Thunderbolts, but he ignores de Fontaine's order to kill them and allows them to retreat, believing that they are not a threat. Developing a god-like delusion of superiority, Bob turns on de Fontaine and is incapacitated by Mel using a failsafe kill switch. This triggers the emergence of the Void, Bob's destructive alter ego and the embodiment of his depression and insecurities which have been amplified by the Sentry procedure. The Void begins to engulf New York City in supernatural darkness, trapping its citizens in visions of their own traumatic memories. Realizing that the only way to stop the Void is from within, Yelena enters the darkness to reach Bob's consciousness. She faces her haunted past as a Black Widow, and finds Bob hiding in a recreation of his childhood bedroom where he hid from his abusive father. The other Thunderbolts join them, and together they face off with Bob's various traumas and drug addiction until they reach his memory of the Sentry procedure in the Malaysia laboratory. They find the Void and are swiftly overpowered. Bob's attempts to fight back threaten to consume him completely, until the Thunderbolts hug Bob and affirm their belief in him which empowers Bob to regain control and overcome the Void. Light returns to the city and the victims are freed. With the threat of the Void neutralized, the Thunderbolts prepare to apprehend de Fontaine. She manipulates public perception by staging a press conference in which she introduces the team as the New Avengers and takes credit for their actions. The group goes along with the announcement, but Yelena quietly tells de Fontaine, \"We own you now.\" In a post-credits scene set fourteen months later, the New Avengers and Bob discuss a growing feud with Sam Wilson, who has his own Avengers team and is suing the New Avengers for trademark infringement. There is also an ongoing problem in outer space, and the group are interrupted when the Watchtower detects the arrival of an extra-dimensional spacecraft that has a large \"4\" emblem on the side.",

To save them from prison, Edie's father urges her to speed away, but she crashes the car. Her mother is killed and her father is left a paraplegic, while Edie survives a series of abusive foster homes until she is rescued by John, a young petty criminal. Falling in love, Edie and John carry out numerous robberies for mob boss Nico, who nicknames her \"Eenie Meanie\". Fourteen years later, Edie has left her life as a getaway driver behind, and finally broken up with John. Working at a bank to put herself through community college, she is knocked unconscious during a robbery; taken to the hospital, she learns she is pregnant. Against her better judgement, Edie visits John, who is being interrogated by Nico's goons, and reluctantly uses her driving skills to save him. John reveals he has kidnapped Leo, a card counter in Nico's employ, who refused to help him with a scheme behind Nico's back. Edie demands that they make amends, but Leo is accidentally killed by a passing truck. Furious to be pulled back into John's poor decisions, Edie meets with Nico and his right-hand man George, who hold John accountable for the loss of Leo's earnings. In exchange for sparing John's life, Nico forces Edie to accept a job: stealing a car containing $3 million in cash, the prize for an upcoming poker tournament at a casino in Toledo. The heist's planning is overseen at Gary's bar by the Chaperone, who considers John a liability, but Edie remains loyal to her ex-boyfriend. With inside help from casino staff and a series of payoffs, the prize Dodge Charger is replaced with an identical model outfitted for the robbery.

He discovers that when combined, they create a portal that transports him to the Overworld, a world where the terrain is made of easily manipulated cubes. He builds his own paradise and later stumbles across a portal to a hellish world called the Nether. He is imprisoned by Malgosha, the gold-obsessed piglin ruler of the Nether who gravely discourages creativity. Because the Orb would allow her to control the Overworld, Steve has his dog Dennis escape with the Orb and Crystal and hide them under his bed in the real world. Sometime later, 1980s video game champion Garrett \"The Garbage Man\" Garrison owns a failing video game store in Chuglass, Idaho. He heads to a storage auction to acquire items to sell for cash, ultimately winning the contents of Steve's old house. While searching through the items, particularly hoping to find an Atari Cosmos, he instead finds Steve's old belongings including the Orb and Crystal. Siblings Henry and Natalie move to Chuglass following their mother's death. The two meet Dawn, their real estate agent who also runs a mobile petting zoo. On Henry's first day of school, he gets in trouble when his experimental jetpack is sabotaged and damages the potato chip factory's mascot Chuggy. To avoid expulsion from Vice Principal Marlene, he pays Garrett to play his uncle and takes him to the video game store. There, Henry discovers the Orb and Crystal and combines them, leading the two to Steve's mine. Natalie finds Henry missing and calls Dawn who tracks down Henry's location via Natalie's phone. As the four reunite, they are sucked into the portal and arrive in the Overworld. Malgosha learns that the Orb has returned and releases Steve from his imprisonment in the Nether to reclaim it, saying that she has Dennis as a hostage. While fighting off monsters at night, Henry learns to manipulate blocks and builds a wooden fortress. The Earth Crystal is destroyed in the commotion. Steve appears at dawn and defeats the monsters as he tells the group that a replacement Crystal will be needed from the Woodland Mansion and joins them. To prepare for this quest, he leads them to a nearby village and demonstrates how to craft. Piglins seeking the Orb of Dominance launch an attack on the village. Steve, Garrett, and Henry narrowly escape while Natalie and Dawn are separated from them and befriend Dennis. Malgosha responds by sending out the Great Hog, a massive Piglin. When Steve mentions that he has a hoard of diamonds, Garrett becomes interested and demands access as an added condition to handing over the Orb. They make a detour and find the hoard, but Henry is angered by their disregard for Natalie's safety. When the Great Hog arrives, they escape using minecarts and the Hog is blown up by creepers. Arriving at the mansion, Steve and Garrett attempt to distract the guards while Henry acquires both the Earth Crystal and an Ender Pearl which can facilitate one's teleportation. Malgosha returns and destroys the bridge to the mansion. Steve and Henry lose the Orb to her, but escape as Garrett seemingly sacrifices himself in the blast. The two awaken with Dawn, Natalie, and Dennis in a mushroom house. Malgosha uses the Orb to superpower the Nether portal, blotting out the sun and declaring war on the Overworld. The party crafts an arsenal of weaponry and an army of iron golems to fight the piglin invasion, while Steve fights Malgosha. Henry uses the Ender Pearl to obtain the Crystal, restoring the sunlight and causing Malgosha and her army to zombify. The party, including Garrett who survived the explosion, returns to Chuglass, where they develop the successful video game Block City Battle Buddies. Dawn opens her zoo with Dennis as an attraction, Natalie begins teaching self-defense classes, Henry completes his jetpack, and Garrett revitalizes the game store with Steve.",

Paradox plans to use a \"Time Ripper\" device to accelerate this process. Wade steals Paradox's TemPad device and uses it to travel to Logan's grave, hoping to resurrect him and save their timeline. When this fails, Wade travels the multiverse searching for a replacement \"variant\" of Logan. Wade returns to the TVA with a variant of Logan. Paradox says an anchor being cannot be replaced, especially by this variant who is considered to be the worst Wolverine in the multiverse. When Wade deduces that Paradox is acting without the knowledge of his superiors, Paradox sends Wade and Logan to the Void, a wasteland at the end of time. Wade claims the TVA can change events in Logan's past, convincing him to work together to escape the Void. The pair are captured alongside Johnny Storm and taken to Cassandra Nova, the powerful and sadistic twin sister of X-Men leader Charles Xavier. Cassandra, who made a deal with the TVA to oversee the Void, kills Johnny and leaves Wade and Logan to be consumed by the creature Alioth, but the pair escape. Logan and Wade meet Deadpool variants \"Nicepool\" and \"Dogpool\", who direct them towards a resistance group that has been fighting Cassandra. Wade accidentally admits that he is not certain whether the TVA can change Logan's timeline, and the pair fight until they are both unconscious. They are found by the resistance group, consisting of Laura, Elektra, Blade, and Gambit. Wade proposes an alliance and Laura convinces Logan—regretful of his past actions which led to the deaths of his fellow X-Men—to join. The resistance members distract Cassandra's henchmen while Wade and Logan block her powers using Juggernaut's helmet. Cassandra is betrayed by her follower Pyro on behalf of Paradox and almost dies, until Logan convinces Wade to remove the helmet. Cassandra heals herself and uses a Sling Ring to open a portal to Earth-10005 for Logan and Wade. Cassandra learns about the Time Ripper from Pyro, kills him, and follows Logan and Wade to Earth-10005. She plans to use the Time Ripper to destroy all timelines, leaving only the Void. Cassandra summons an army of Deadpool variants, who kill Nicepool and battle Wade and Logan until Peter arrives to distract them. Paradox tells Wade and Logan that one of them could destroy the Time Ripper by disrupting its power flow, but this would kill them. Wade and Logan destroy the Time Ripper together, killing Cassandra in the process, and survive by sharing the burden. Paradox is arrested by the TVA's Hunter B-15, who congratulates Wade and Logan and says their actions have stopped Earth-10005 from deteriorating. Wade asks Hunter B-15 to save the resistance group from the Void and change the history of Logan's world. She explains that the latter is not possible because Logan's history is what led to him being a hero now, but allows Logan to stay in Wade's universe. During a gathering with Wade's friends that includes Dogpool and a rescued Laura, Logan encourages Wade to reconcile with Vanessa.",

    "plot": "Having acquired the Power Stone—one of six Infinity Stones—from the planet Xandar, Thanos and his lieutenants—Ebony Maw, Cull Obsidian, Proxima Midnight, and Corvus Glaive—intercept the spaceship carrying the survivors of Asgard's destruction. After subduing Thor, Thanos extracts the Space Stone from the Tesseract, overpowers the Hulk, kills Loki, and fatally wounds Heimdall. Before dying, Heimdall sends Hulk to Earth using the Bifröst. Thanos and his lieutenants leave, destroying the ship. Hulk crash-lands in the Sanctum Sanctorum in New York City, reverting to the form of Bruce Banner. He warns Stephen Strange and Wong about Thanos's plan to destroy half of all life in the universe, and they recruit Tony Stark. Maw and Obsidian arrive to retrieve the Time Stone from Strange, drawing Peter Parker's attention. Maw, unable to take the Time Stone due to Strange's enchantment, captures him. Stark and Parker sneak aboard Maw's spaceship while Wong stays behind to guard the Sanctum. The Guardians of the Galaxy respond to the Asgardian ship's distress call and rescue Thor. Thor surmises that Thanos is after the Reality Stone, which Taneleer Tivan possesses on Knowhere. He travels with Rocket and Groot to Nidavellir to enlist the dwarf king Eitri's aid in creating the battle-axe Stormbreaker. Peter Quill, Gamora, Drax, and Mantis travel to Knowhere, finding Thanos already has the Reality Stone. Thanos kidnaps Gamora, who discloses the Soul Stone's location to save Nebula from torture. On Vormir, the Stone's keeper, Red Skull, tells Thanos that he can only acquire it by sacrificing someone he loves. Thanos sacrifices Gamora, earning the Stone. Midnight and Glaive ambush Wanda Maximoff and Vision in Edinburgh to retrieve the Mind Stone which is in Vision's forehead. Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Sam Wilson rescue them and they take shelter with James Rhodes and Banner at the Avengers Compound. Vision asks Wanda to destroy him and the Mind Stone to keep it from Thanos, but she refuses. The group travels to Wakanda, which Rogers believes has the resources to remove the Stone without killing Vision. Nebula escapes captivity and asks the remaining Guardians to meet her on Thanos's destroyed homeworld, Titan. Stark and Parker kill Maw and rescue Strange. The trio crash-lands on Titan, where they meet Quill, Drax, and Mantis. Using the Time Stone, Strange views millions of possible futures, seeing only one in which the Avengers win. The group formulates a plan to subdue Thanos and remove the Infinity Gauntlet, with which he safely houses and wields the Stones. Thanos appears, justifying his plans as necessary to guarantee the survival of an overpopulated universe. Nebula arrives soon after and helps the others subdue Thanos, but deduces that Thanos has killed Gamora. Enraged, Quill attacks Thanos, allowing him to break the group's hold and overpower them. Thanos grievously wounds Stark, but Strange offers the Time Stone in exchange for sparing Stark's life. In Wakanda, Rogers reunites with Bucky Barnes before Thanos' army invades. The Avengers, along with T'Challa and the Wakandan forces, mount a defense while Shuri works to extract the Mind Stone from Vision. Unable to summon the Hulk, Banner fights in Stark's Hulkbuster armor. Thor, Rocket, and Groot arrive to reinforce the Avengers. Together they kill Midnight, Obsidian, and Glaive, and rout Thanos's army. Shuri cannot complete the extraction before Thanos arrives on the field; the Avengers and their allies fail to stop him from reaching Vision. Vision convinces a reluctant Wanda to destroy him and the Mind Stone, but Thanos uses the Time Stone to reverse her actions, rip the stone from Vision's forehead, and complete the Gauntlet. Thor severely wounds Thanos with Stormbreaker, but Thanos activates the completed Gauntlet by snapping his fingers before teleporting away. Half of all life across the universe disintegrates, including Barnes, T'Challa, Groot, Wanda, Wilson, Mantis, Drax, Quill, Strange, Parker, Maria Hill, and Nick Fury, the last of whom sends an emergency signal on a modified pager before disintegrating. Stark and Nebula remain stranded on Titan while Banner, M'Baku, Okoye, Rhodes, Rocket, Rogers, Romanoff, and Thor are left on the Wakandan battlefield. Meanwhile, Thanos watches a sunrise on a remote planet.",

    "plot": "The film is about the fictional martial artist Guo Jing during the Southern Song dynasty which was established after the Jingkang Incident. While war rages between the Mongols and the Jin Dynasty, Guo Jing (Xiao Zhan) searches for Huang Rong (Zhuang Dafei), a woman he met during his two-year journey to the Middle Land to acquire martial arts skills from the Seven Freaks of Jiangnan. It was she who led him to a better master than his previous ones, Hong Qigong (Hu Jun) of the Five Greats, where he learned the powerful martial art Eighteen Dragon(-Subduing) Palms. Once, Huang Rong was seriously injured, and Guo Jing carried her on his back to seek Duan Zhixing (Wu Hsing-kuo). There, he learned the healing techniques of the Novem Scripture. When he accompanied her to her home at Peach Blossom Island, one day he found most of his former masters murdered. Since they had warned him about Huang Rong's father, Huang Yaoshi, he believed him responsible for their deaths and subsequently left her. Later, Huang Rong is captured by the Jin-loyal martial arts master Ouyang Feng (Tony Leung Ka-fai) and his men. In order to become the best martial artist in the world he seeks the Novem Scripture, which she and Guo Jing had obtained. Huang Rong uses a trick to sow discord among them. Thus, while Ouyang Feng is preoccupied with his own men, she manages to cut her restraints using a stone and escapes by leaping into the river. At the same time, Guo Jing has realized his mistake of shunning Huang Rong and leaves small pinwheels as clues for her to follow him. While resting by a river, he overhears a man speaking to a group of Mongols. The man, one of Ouyang Feng's followers, reveals that he has poisoned the river and will only provide the antidote if they obey him. Recognizing his sworn brother, Tolui (Alan Aruna), among the suffering Mongols, Guo Jing intervenes, defeats the enemy, and heals the poisoned victims using the martial arts technique he has learned. Huang Rong tries to escape Ouyang Feng and his men in the bustling streets of a town. The chaos of a sudden skirmish between Ouyang Feng's group and a band of soldiers provides her with an opportunity to flee. Tolui and a high-ranking soldier urge Guo Jing to return with them to the Mongol camp, at least to reunite with his mother, who has waited two years for his return. Upon arrival, he is greeted warmly by the soldiers, his likewise returning adoptive father Genghis Khan (Baya'ertu), and his mother Li Ping (Ada Choi). Meanwhile, Huang Rong discovers one of the pinwheels and a mark on a stone pointing her toward Guo Jing's whereabouts. As she rides across the grasslands, she is once again pursued by Ouyang Feng's men. However, she is rescued by a group of women led by Mongol princess Hua Zheng (Wenxin Zhang). They take her to the Mongolian camp and tend to her wounds. Upon learning of Guo Jing's return, Hua Zheng excitedly tells Huang Rong that she is betrothed to him by her father, leaving the latter heartbroken. Inside his mother's tent, Guo Jing discusses her wish for him to return to the Middle Land and defend their homeland against invaders. While he prays for his late father, Hua Zheng bursts in excitedly, but he angrily orders her to wait outside. Later, as they go for a ride, she mentions their upcoming marriage, but Guo Jing tells her he never truly intended to marry her. He explains that during his time in the Middle Land, he met someone who taught him what it means to truly love. Enraged, Hua Zheng storms back to her tent, where she finds Huang Rong preparing to leave. Furious, she vows to find and behead the woman who has stolen Guo Jing's heart, unaware that she is speaking to her. That evening, as Guo Jing demonstrates his martial arts skills before the entire camp, intruders infiltrate the area - it is Ouyang Feng and his men. He interrupts the brewing conflict between Huang Rong and Hua Zheng, the latter having discovered her identity. In a surprising move, Huang Rong saves the princess' life by handing Ouyang Feng a fake copy of the Novem Scripture. Shortly after, she quietly leaves the camp, unwilling to stand in the way of Guo Jing's betrothal, despite Hua Zheng assuring her that she will accept his choice. Following another battle between the Mongols and the attacking Jin forces, Genghis Khan decides to march on the Jin capital. Since the Song Dynasty refuses to allow him passage through their territory, he is prepared to engage them in war as well. Knowing the area, Guo Jing is to be ordered to lead the Mongol army. However, having left the camp in search of Huang Rong directly after the battle with the Jin, Guo Jing learns from a Song soldier that the Mongols are about to attack. He rushes back to the Mongol camp and refuses to lead the attack against the land where he was born. As a result, he is sentenced to execution. Only Tolui's pleas save him, but he and his mother are forbidden from leaving the camp. When Guo Jing goes to fetch his mother and escape, she takes her own life to avoid becoming a burden, believing his duty to defend their homeland is more important. With Hua Zheng's help, Guo Jing manages to flee. After burying his mother, he finally reunites with Huang Rong, and together they pledge to aid the Song in defending their border city. Before the Mongols launch their attack on the Songs border town, Ouyang Feng appears. Driven insane by training with the fake manual, he unleashes his enhanced martial arts on the Mongols, causing destruction. Fearing that he might pose a threat to both sides, Guo Jing intervenes to protect his former allies, leading to an intense martial arts battle between him and Ouyang Feng. In the end, Guo Jing triumphs and saves Genghis Khan. Riding to the front of the Mongol army, Guo Jing boldly declares that they will have to go through him to conquer the city. Genghis Khan calls him for a final conversation. In a heartfelt speech about heroism and the responsibility of protecting one's own people instead of conquering others, Guo Jing convinces him to retreat: saving the Song city from destruction. However, knowing that the Khan's family might lead the future invasions, Guo Jing chooses to remain in the city to train soldiers.",

    "plot": "During the glory days of superheroes, Bob Parr (alias Mr. Incredible) thwarts a civilian's attempted suicide by tackling him through a skyscraper window. Bob discovers supervillain Bomb Voyage robbing the building, but is interrupted by his devoted fanboy Buddy Pine, who wants to be his sidekick. Bob rejects Buddy, and Voyage clips a bomb onto Buddy's cape. Bob gets the bomb off, but it destroys an elevated train track, forcing Bob to stop an oncoming train. After his wedding with Helen (alias Elastigirl), Bob is sued for collateral damage by the suicidal civilian and the injured train passengers. Similar lawsuits create negative public image on superheroes, and the government initiates the Superhero Relocation Program, banning \"supers\" from using their powers in public and forcing them into hiding. Fifteen years later, Bob lives with Helen and their children, Violet, Dash, and baby Jack-Jack, in a quiet suburb of Metroville. Bob misses his superhero days and resents his mundane job as a claims adjuster, moonlighting as a vigilante with his friend Lucius Best (alias Frozone). One day, Bob injures his supervisor Gilbert Huph after being prevented from stopping a mugging, and is consequently dismissed. That evening, a woman named Mirage secretly offers Bob a mission to subdue a giant \"Omnidroid\" robot loose on the island of Nomanisan. Bob succeeds by tricking the machine into ripping out its own power source. Rejuvenated by the action and higher pay, Bob trains to get back into shape, and asks superhero costume designer Edna Mode to fix a tear in his old suit. Incorrectly assuming that Helen knows of Bob's new job, Edna makes new suits for the entire family. Summoned back to Nomanisan, Bob discovers Mirage is working for Buddy, now calling himself Syndrome after being embittered by Bob's rejection. Syndrome has become wealthy by inventing weapons that mimic superpowers. He has been perfecting the Omnidroid by luring supers to fight it until it kills them. Syndrome intends to send an Omnidroid to attack Metroville, then defeat it publicly with secret controls, thereby gaining \"hero\" status. He intends to then sell his inventions to the world, thereby rendering superheroes meaningless. Helen visits Edna and learns what Bob has been up to. She activates a beacon Edna built into the suits to find Bob, inadvertently causing him to be captured while infiltrating Syndrome's base. Helen borrows a private plane to fly to Nomanisan; Violet and Dash stow away, leaving Jack-Jack with a babysitter. Despite knowing that there are children on the plane, Syndrome shoots it down. Helen and the kids survive and make their way to the island. Disillusioned by Syndrome's callousness, Mirage releases Bob and informs him of his family's survival. Syndrome's guards pursue Dash and Violet, who fend them off with their powers and reunite with their parents. Syndrome captures the family before following the Omnidroid to Metroville. Violet uses her powers to free her family, and Mirage helps them reach Metroville. Recognizing Syndrome's remote-control gauntlet as a threat, the Omnidroid disarms and knocks him out. The Incredibles and Lucius fight the Omnidroid; Helen and the kids retrieve the remote control, allowing Bob to destroy the robot's power source. The family and Lucius are appreciated by the public just as Syndrome awakens to see their victory. Returning home, the Parrs find Syndrome abducting Jack-Jack to raise as a sidekick for revenge. As Syndrome flies up, Jack-Jack's superpowers manifest, and he escapes Syndrome's hold. Helen rescues the falling baby, and Bob throws his car at Syndrome's plane, sending him into one of its engines. Three months later, the Parrs witness the arrival of supervillain the Underminer. They don their masks and suits, ready to face the new threat.",

Gradov outsmarts them, and his men kill Bisset's team and acquire a link to ECHELON, the global surveillance program used by the Anglosphere intelligence alliance Five Eyes. Meanwhile, Sam Clarke, the UK Prime Minister, receives a state visit from the newly elected United States President Will Derringer, a former action movie star. The two do not get along, and a public argument breaks out in front of the press, after which their respective aides Quincy and Bradshaw convince them to fly to the upcoming NATO summit in Trieste together aboard Air Force One to present a united front to the world. During the flight, Air Force One is shot down by Gradov's terrorists. Clarke and Derringer escape using parachutes but are stranded in Belarus and presumed dead by the rest of the world. Realizing that someone in their inner circles has betrayed them to Gradov, the two hitch a ride to Poland with a friendly Belarusian lady and seek shelter with CIA officer Marty Comer in Warsaw. Gradov's men, led by assassins Sasha and Olga, attack the hideout, and Comer is shot in the head. Clarke and Derringer escape with the help of Bisset, who survived Gradov's attack in Spain. Bisset tells Clarke and Derringer that the NATO summit has been derailed due to Gradov's hacker Hammond breaking in to the Echelon and leaking national security files to the public. Derringer also learns that Clarke and Bisset were in a relationship prior to Clarke running for office. The three embark for the summit in Italy by train, where they are attacked by another of Gradov's assassins. Hammond, tired of being forced to work for Gradov, kills the assassin but is mortally wounded. He instructs the trio to go to his former office in Zadar, Croatia, to find out who betrayed them. They locate old chat logs that implicate Derringer's aide Bradshaw. They are again attacked by Gradov's assassins, and Clarke is seemingly killed in an explosion. Derringer and Bisset arrive in Trieste for the summit, where they learn that the real traitor is Vice President Elizabeth Kirk, who implicated Bradshaw as a false trail. The assassins working for her and Gradov chase Derringer and Bisset through Trieste. The two are saved by Clarke, who survived the explosion. Olga is killed when her grenade launcher goes off by accident during the chase, and the trio arrives at the summit in time to prevent the dissolution of NATO at the hands of Kirk. Derringer confronts her, but she is shot and killed by Gradov, whose assassins assault the summit. Bisset fights and kills Sasha, while Clarke and Derringer pursue Gradov, killing him when the latter throws a statue at his helicopter, causing it to crash. Two months later, the relationships within NATO have been repaired, and Clarke and Derringer have become close friends. In a post-credits scene, Comer is revealed to have survived the attack in Warsaw due to a metal plate in his head and is approached by Bisset while attempting to pick up women at a bar.",

In the middle of the firefight, the soldiers are mysteriously abducted and vanish from the battlefield. They awaken, disoriented and confined inside translucent stasis pods, aboard a massive, dimly lit alien spacecraft. As the soldiers recover, the stasis pods suddenly dissolve, expelling them. Exploring their surroundings, the team finds skinned human corpses and unfamiliar weapons and technology. They are soon attacked by alien creatures—tall, eyeless humanoids with armored skin, sharp claws, and energy-based shields. The soldiers fight their way through the corridors using their remaining weapons and scavenged alien gear. The group encounters Ravi, a young Russian woman. Wary of the team, she explains that the ship collects humans to be processed as food. She joins the group and leads them through lesser-traveled maintenance tunnels. After a series of battles, she trusts them enough to tell them of a safe room. The team follows, eventually dropping down a vent into a pool of blood filled with remains of humans. Arguing and panic ensues before another survivor named Anya, Ravi's mother, appears and rescues them. Anya tells the soldiers that she has survived for twenty to thirty years in the ship, and that she has a plan to destroy the aliens communication array with explosives to prevent reinforcements. But to do so, a distraction is needed, so Kelly agrees to draw as many of the aliens away as he can. Although successful at first, one of the aliens, Scars, discerns their plan when the team shows up on a motion sensor, which enables him and other aliens to track them. With the group decimated down to Kelly, Ravi, a soldier named Nash and herself, Anya sacrifices herself in a final stand by detonating charges that destroy most of the pursuing aliens. The remaining fugitives reach a hatch leading outside, only for Nash to get killed by Scars, the only survivor of his crew. After luring Scars into an open hatch and closing it on him, cutting him in half, Kelly finds Ravi looking upwards at an orange glow.

The body of Yin Jiao—former crown prince of the Shang dynasty—is brought to Kunlun by Nezha and Yang Jian to be resurrected. Despite protests that resurrection will go against natural order, The Great Saint decides to resurrect Jiao. However, he finds that Jiao's soul is filled with hatred and vengeance against his father Yin Shou, causing him to absorb the Great Saint's power. King Yin Shou, newly resurrected by the fox spirit, welcomes Grand Preceptor Wen Zhong and his armies home to Zhaoge after 10 years at war, alongside his generals Deng Chanyu and the Four Demonic Giants. They welcome Shou in the palace, who requests Zhong to capture Ji Fa and Ziya for the Investiture Scroll. Zhong declines and seeks retirement after a long hardship of protecting their dynasty but Chanyu requests to lead the mission, honoring her late father's wishes for her to become a renowned warrior. Shou sends an emissary, ordering Ji Fa to commit suicide or risk an invasion of Xiqi, which Ji Fa refuses. Though his troops manage to fend off Chanyu's forces, they were overpowered and hastily retreat. Chanyu pursues Ji Fa, who barely escapes. Ji Fa reunites with Ziya who was captured by Shen Gongbao's crows, confessing that he ordered Xiqi's evacuation. Ziya then convinces him to continue fighting against Shou. Meanwhile, the fox spirit, severely weakened trying to restore Shou to full health, is unable to keep Daji's body fresh anymore. They search for a new vessel for the spirit, only to find that she is unable to leave Daji's body. Upon Ji Fa and Ziya's return, Ziya suggests Ji Fa's forces to attack Chanyu's encampment later that night. Though they managed to kill one of the giants at Chanyu's camp, they were unable to defeat the remainder who assault the city the following day. Jiao, having absorbed the Great Saint's power, defeats the giants while Ji Fa rescues Chanyu from drowning and offers to surrender in exchange for Chanyu's forces sparing Xiqi and its inhabitants. Meanwhile, Shou coerces Zhong to reassume command of his forces. Chanyu brings Ji Fa to Zhong, who refuses Ji Fa's plea to surrender and orders a massacre on Xiqi. Disgusted by Zhong's willingness to kill innocents, Chanyu helps Ji Fa escape imprisonment. Zhong pursues them, but Jiao holds him back, swearing to kill him if the invasion continues. Jiao reunites with Ji Fa, and Chanyu is accepted as a guest in Xiqi for saving Ji Fa, while The Grandmaster of Heaven grants Gongbao a gourd of Gu to kill Shou's remaining forces and resurrect them as obedient, undead soldiers. Zhong cloaks Xiqi in darkness and summons floating mirrors that incapacitate anyone caught in their beams in a ritual; Chanyu's forces—now under Zhong's command—are protected by a sigil, allowing them to breach the city unimpeded, which Ziya recognises from a similar mark on Chanyu. Ziya realizes that Zhong is after him and the Scroll; Chanyu bargained with Zhong to bring Ziya and the Scroll in exchange for sparing Xiqi, allowing himself to be captured by Chanyu and brought to Zhong's altar. Ziya indicates Zhong's location to Ji Fa with a flare. At the altar, Ji Fa prepares to kill Zhong as he completes the ritual to wipe out everyone affected by his mirrors; conversely, this will also eliminate everyone protected by his sigil—including Chanyu. After defeating Zhong's qilin, Chanyu helps Ji Fa kill Zhong, stopping the ritual and returning Ji Fa's allies to consciousness as Zhong's troops and Chanyu dissipate. In several credits scenes, Jiao travels alone back to Zhaoge to kill Shou, but is halted by the Grandmaster and his disciples Yunxiao, Qiongxiao and Bixiao; Gongbao meets Zhong to collect his head according to the King's orders, leading an army of Gu soldiers onto Xiqi. The Grandmaster raises a brainwashed Jiao from a pool of mercury, presenting him to Shou and Daji as their puppet.",

    "title": "Sonic the Hedgehog 3",
    "plot": "In 1974, a meteorite containing the alien hedgehog Shadow crash-lands in Oklahoma and is seized by the U.S. military. Shadow's power is experimented on by Professor Gerald Robotnik at a Guardian Units of Nations (G.U.N.) research facility under the supervision of Captain Walters; Shadow also develops a close friendship with Maria, Gerald's granddaughter. One night, as Gerald, Maria, and Shadow try to escape the facility to prevent Shadow from being taken away, Maria is accidentally killed in an explosion. Walters shuts down the facility, imprisons Gerald, and places Shadow in suspended animation. In 2024, an unknown individual hacks into a G.U.N. prison facility's system off the coast of Japan and releases a vengeful Shadow. Sonic celebrates the anniversary of his arrival on Earth with Tails, Knuckles, and their adoptive parents Tom and Maddie Wachowski, in Green Hills, Montana. G.U.N. Director Rockwell arrives and recruits Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles (dubbed \"Team Sonic\") to help apprehend Shadow in Tokyo. However, he overpowers the three and escapes. Team Sonic meets with the now-Commander Walters, who informs them about Shadow's past. Suddenly, Dr. Ivo Robotnik's drones attack and fatally wound Walters, who gives Sonic a keycard before he dies. They decide to search for Shadow without G.U.N.'s help as Rockwell discovers the missing keycard and turns against them. Team Sonic encounters Ivo's assistant, Agent Stone, who denies involvement in the attack; they form an uneasy alliance with Ivo and track the stolen drones to the abandoned G.U.N. facility. As Shadow captures Stone and Team Sonic, Ivo meets Gerald, his long-lost grandfather and the mastermind behind Shadow's escape and the stolen drones. Gerald explains that the keycard is one of two needed to activate the Eclipse Cannon, an orbiting laser space weapon he designed for G.U.N., capable of targeting and destroying any location on Earth. He claims that he plans to use it to destroy G.U.N.'s headquarters in London, and Ivo agrees to join him. Shadow takes the keycard from Tails and activates a black hole to destroy the base as he, the Robotniks, and Stone leave. Team Sonic escapes using a ring portal and recruits Tom and Maddie to steal the second keycard from G.U.N.'s headquarters, contending with the Robotniks and Rockwell. Tom successfully obtains the keycard by disguising himself as Walters, but Shadow, buying into Tom's disguise and enraged at G.U.N., gravely wounds him, taking the key, allowing the Robotniks to launch the Eclipse Cannon. Enraged, Sonic abandons Tails and Knuckles, steals the Master Emerald, and becomes superpowered using the seven Chaos Emeralds contained within. Sonic confronts Shadow, who also absorbs the Chaos Emeralds' energy to become superpowered. Sonic eventually overpowers Shadow but relents upon realizing he was being consumed by revenge. Sonic tells Shadow about the loss of his guardian Longclaw and that their love for the people they have lost is more important than revenge. Having a change of heart, Shadow agrees to stop the cannon. Aboard the Eclipse Cannon, Gerald reveals to Ivo his intention to destroy Earth and themselves to avenge Maria's death. A horrified Ivo attempts to abort the firing sequence, preferring to rule over humanity rather than destroy it, but Gerald destroys the command console. Tails and Knuckles arrive, and the three knock Gerald into the reactor core, killing him. Sonic and Shadow block the cannon's beam as Ivo, Tails, and Knuckles steer it away from Earth, accidentally slicing off part of the Moon. Sonic loses his superpowered form and consciousness while blocking the cannon's beam with Shadow and falls back to Earth. Tails and Knuckles save Sonic using a ring portal to Green Hills. When the cannon's core begins to melt down, Ivo makes a final announcement acknowledging Stone as his only friend before he and Shadow sacrifice themselves to move it away from Earth before it explodes. Sonic reconciles with Tails and Knuckles while Tom recovers from his injuries. During a race with Tails and Knuckles, Sonic accidentally ends up outside of New York, where he is ambushed by an army of Metal Sonic robots and saved by Amy Rose. Elsewhere, Shadow has survived the cannon's destruction.",

    "title": "Spider-Man: No Way Home",
    "plot": "After Quentin Beck frames Peter Parker for his murder and reveals that Peter is Spider-Man, the Department of Damage Control arrests Peter; his girlfriend, Michelle \"MJ\" Jones-Watson; his best friend, Ned Leeds; and his aunt, May Parker. Lawyer Matt Murdock gets Peter's charges dropped, but the group grapples with negative publicity. After Peter's, MJ's, and Ned's MIT applications are rejected, Peter goes to the New York Sanctum to ask Dr. Stephen Strange for help. Strange starts casting a spell that would make everyone forget Peter is Spider-Man, but it is corrupted when Peter repeatedly requests alterations to let his loved ones retain their memories. Strange contains the corrupted spell. At Strange's suggestion, Peter tries to convince an MIT administrator to reconsider MJ's and Ned's applications. He is attacked by Otto Octavius, who rips nanotechnology from Peter's Iron Spider suit. This bonds with Octavius's mechanical tentacles and allows Peter to control them. As Norman Osborn arrives and attacks, Strange teleports Peter back to the Sanctum and locks Octavius in a cell next to Curt Connors. Strange explains that the corrupted spell summoned people from other universes within the multiverse who know Spider-Man's identity. He orders Peter, MJ, and Ned to find and capture the others; they locate and retrieve Max Dillon and Flint Marko at a military research facility. Osborn reclaims control of himself from his split Green Goblin personality and destroys the Goblin mask. He gets help from May until Peter retrieves him. While discussing their battles with Spider-Man, Osborn, Octavius, and Dillon realize they were pulled from their universes just before their deaths. Strange prepares to reverse the contained spell and send the villains back to their respective universes, but Peter argues that they should first help each villain to possibly change their fates upon their return. When Strange refuses, Peter steals the spell, traps Strange in the Mirror Dimension, and takes the villains to Happy Hogan's apartment. He uses Stark Industries technology to cure Octavius. Before Peter can cure anyone else, the Goblin persona retakes control of Osborn. The Goblin convinces the other villains to betray Peter and fatally wounds May as Dillon, Marko, and Connors escape; before she dies, May tells Peter that \"with great power, there must also come great responsibility\". Ned discovers that he can create portals using Strange's sling ring, which he and MJ use to try to locate Peter. They instead find \"Peter-Two\" and \"Peter-Three\", alternate versions of Peter who were also summoned from the villains' universes by Strange's spell. The group finds this universe's Peter (\"Peter-One\"), who is mourning May and ready to send the villains home to die. The alternate Peters share stories of losing Uncle Ben and Gwen Stacy and encourage Peter-One to fight in May's honor. The three Peters develop cures for the villains and lure them to the Statue of Liberty. Peter-One and Peter-Two cure Connors and Marko while Octavius helps cure Dillon. Ned accidentally frees Strange from the Mirror Dimension. The Goblin unleashes the contained spell, breaking the barriers between universes and pulling in countless others who know Peter's identity. Strange attempts to hold them off while an enraged Peter-One tries to kill the Goblin. Peter-Two stops him and Peter-Three helps Peter-One inject the Goblin with his cure, restoring Osborn's sanity. Peter-One realizes that the only way to protect the multiverse is to erase himself from everyone's memory and requests Strange do so while promising MJ and Ned that he will find them and remind them who he is. Strange reluctantly casts the spell, and everyone returns to their respective universes—including Eddie Brock, who unknowingly leaves behind a piece of the Venom symbiote. Two weeks later, Peter visits MJ to reintroduce himself to her and Ned, but decides against it. While mourning at May's grave, he has a conversation with an unknowing Hogan and is inspired to carry on, making a new Spider-Man suit and resuming his vigilantism.",

    "title": "The Shadow's Edge",
    "plot": "In Macau, the police are hot on the trail of a heist crew led by longtime fugitive The Shadow, ultimately found out as former intelligence officer Fu Lang-seng, which includes his five adoptive sons. The crew, featuring ringleader Xi Wang, hacker Xi Meng, and muscle Hu Feng, has just broken into a bank vault to steal a notebook. However, Xi Meng hacks the surveillance footage, allowing the crew to escape undetected. The police discover that the vault belongs to a wealthy businessman and learn the notebook contains an encryption key to his cryptocurrency account. They deduce that the crew will target a digital asset management company at Macau Tower. As the heist crew infiltrates the Tower, they find an unexpected HK$1.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency in the same virtual vault. Ignoring Fu's objections, they decide to steal it as well. Their delay, however, allows the police to arrive on the scene, leading them to a nearby hotel resort. When the crew is cornered, Fu enters the resort to provide cover, enabling their escape. Unfortunately, a barista captures Fu's image during the commotion. With no leads following the nearly flawless heist, Wang decides to enlist retired surveillance expert Wong Tak-chong for help. Wong, skeptical of modern technology, prefers old-school methods and assembles an elite team, including He Qiuguo, whom he believes can approach Fu unnoticed. With Wong's guidance, the police quickly identify the disguised crew members through surveillance footage and connect Fu to a series of heists committed by a criminal known as Shadow twenty years earlier. Initially, He is cold towards Wong, revealing that her father died during an operation involving Fu, whom she blames for his death. However, during a night watch, she breaks cover to protect a woman from thugs and nearly gets hurt, only to be saved by Wong. He reveals that her father was killed by drug dealers after he also broke cover to act heroically, and the two reconcile. Meanwhile, Fu is enraged by his sons' disobedience and punishes them, causing tension with Xi Meng and Hu, although Xi Wang remains loyal. After realizing his identity has been compromised, Fu goes into hiding. The police soon locate him at a market, and Wong's team begins to follow him back to his lair. He volunteers to tail Fu, who is initially wary but later relaxes when Wong, posing as He's grandfather, arrives to diffuse the situation. The next day, Wong invites Fu to have a dinner at the market and arranges it at a police-occupied apartment, where Fu tests their intentions. During the dinner, He learns that Wong has been secretly watching over her since her father's death. That night, an attempt on their lives by Hu fails, leading them to suspect their cover has been blown. On their way back to headquarters, Wong's vehicle is ambushed by mercenaries, but the police manage to fend them off. Meanwhile, Xi Meng lures Fu to an orphanage, where he finds thugs waiting to kill him. After a fierce fight, Fu defeats them. Xi Wang then appears to hold off Fu and instructs Xi Meng to detonate the orphanage before dying in the blast, but Fu survives the explosion and is arrested by the police. While being transported, Fu escapes, prompting his crew to flee as well. Hu and the others are subdued by Wong, while Fu fatally stabs a policeman and Xi Meng at a metro station. The next morning, He locates Fu at a diner. Fu tries to kill her, but Wong intervenes. Although both are severely injured, Wong buys enough time for the police to arrive, leading to Fu's cornering and arrest. In the post-credits scene, a third twin brother of Xi Wang and Xi Meng is revealed and he places a bounty on Wong, He, and Fu.",

    "title": "The Suicide Squad",
    "plot": "Intelligence officer Amanda Waller assembles two Task Force X teams, colloquially known as the \"Suicide Squad\", which consists of Belle Reve penitentiary inmates who agree to carry out missions in exchange for commuted sentences. The teams are sent to the South American island nation of Corto Maltese after an anti-American regime overthrows its government, and are tasked with destroying the Nazi-era laboratory Jötunheim, which houses the secret experiment \"Project Starfish\". Upon making landfall, the Corto Maltese military slaughters most of the first team and captures Harley Quinn while team leader Rick Flag escapes. Elsewhere, the second team – led by assassin Bloodsport, who Waller blackmailed in exchange for not sending his estranged daughter Tyla to prison, and consisting of Peacemaker, King Shark, Polka-Dot Man, Ratcatcher 2, and her pet rat Sebastian – enters the country undetected, revealing that the other team was a deliberate decoy. Waller orders the squad to find Flag, who is being held at a rebel base. The team massacres the rebel soldiers, only to learn that rebellion leader Sol Soria had saved Flag. Despite the group's actions, Soria agrees to help them infiltrate the capital, where they capture Project Starfish's lead scientist, the Thinker. Harley is taken to Corto Maltese's new dictator, Silvio Luna, who wishes to marry her. After learning of Luna's plans to use Project Starfish on political dissidents, Harley kills him and escapes. She joins the others, who use the Thinker to break into Jötunheim, in exchange for sparing his life, and begin rigging it with explosives. Flag and Ratcatcher 2 enter the Thinker's laboratory and find Starro the Conqueror, a giant starfish–like alien that creates smaller versions of itself to kill people and control their bodies. The Thinker explains that Starro was brought to Earth by American astronauts, that the U.S. government has secretly funded experiments on it for decades using Corto Maltesean citizens and political enemies of the prior dictatorship as test subjects, that said regime used Project Starfish to strengthen its rule, and that Waller sent them to cover up American ties to the project. An enraged Flag decides to leak a hard drive containing evidence of this, but is killed by Peacemaker, who is under orders from Waller to ensure the coverup. Meanwhile, a skirmish between the rest of the team and the military leads to Polka-Dot Man accidentally setting off the explosives prematurely. As Jötunheim crumbles, the drive falls into Ratcatcher 2's possession. Peacemaker attempts to kill her before she can escape with it, but Bloodsport shoots him and takes it. Starro escapes the destroyed Jötunheim, kills the Thinker and much of the military, and begins taking control of the island's population. Waller tells the squad that their mission is complete and orders them to leave, but Bloodsport leads the team in fighting Starro. Waller, wanting to keep the squad's secrecy from the public, attempts to execute them for this, but her subordinates knock her out. Polka-Dot Man weakens Starro, but is killed. Harley pierces a hole in Starro's eye, allowing Ratcatcher 2 to summon the city's rats to chew it to death from the inside. With the military diverted, Soria takes control of the government, promising democratic elections. Bloodsport blackmails Waller into releasing him and the surviving squad members and dropping Tyla's charges in exchange for keeping the contents of the drive confidential. Waller reluctantly agrees and the remaining squad members are airlifted out of Corto Maltese; Harley proposes she and Bloodsport become friends with each other, in honor of their fallen common friend Flag. In a mid-credits scene, it is revealed that Weasel, a member of the first team, has survived and runs off into the jungle. In a post-credits scene, Waller punishes two of her subordinates, Emilia Harcourt and John Economos, by assigning them to a new mission with Peacemaker, who is still alive and recovering in a hospital.",

    "plot": "In 2154, Earth suffers from resource exhaustion and ecological collapse. The Resources Development Administration (RDA) mines the valuable mineral unobtanium on Pandora, a lush habitable moon orbiting a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system. Pandora, whose atmosphere is inhospitable to humans, is inhabited by the Na'vi, 10-foot-tall (3.0 m), blue-skinned, sapient humanoids that live in harmony with nature. To explore Pandora, genetically matched human scientists control Na'vi-human hybrids called \"avatars\". Paraplegic former Marine Jake Sully is recruited by the RDA to replace his deceased identical twin, who had signed up to be an operator. Avatar Program head Dr. Grace Augustine considers Jake inadequate, but accepts him as an operator. While escorting the avatars of Grace and Dr. Norm Spellman, Jake's avatar is attacked by Pandoran wildlife and flees into the forest, where he is rescued by the Na'vi princess Neytiri. Suspicious of Jake, she takes him to her clan. Neytiri's mother, Mo'at, the clan's spiritual leader, orders her daughter to initiate Jake into their society. Colonel Miles Quaritch, head of RDA's security force, promises Jake that the company will restore the use of his legs if he provides information about the Na'vi and their gathering place, the giant Hometree, under which is a rich deposit of unobtanium. Learning of this, Grace transfers herself, Jake, and Norm to an outpost. Jake and Neytiri fall in love as Jake is initiated into the tribe, and they choose each other as mates. When Jake attempts to disable a bulldozer threatening a sacred Na'vi site, Administrator Parker Selfridge orders Hometree destroyed. Despite Grace's argument that destroying Hometree would damage the biological neural network that encompasses all Pandoran life, Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one hour to convince the Na'vi to evacuate. Jake confesses that he was a spy and the Na'vi take him and Grace captive. Quaritch's soldiers destroy Hometree, killing many, including Neytiri's father, the clan chief. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chacón, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, airlifts Jake, Grace, and Norm to Grace's outpost, but during the escape Grace is shot and fatally wounded. Jake regains the Na'vi's trust by connecting his mind to that of the Toruk, a dragon-like creature feared and revered by the Na'vi. Supported by Neytiri and the new chief Tsu'tey, Jake unites the clan, telling them to gather all the clans to battle the RDA. Quaritch organizes a strike against the Tree of Souls to demoralize the Na'vi. Before the battle, Jake prays to the Na'vi deity Eywa via a neural connection with the Tree of Souls. Tsu'tey and Trudy are among the battle's heavy casualties. The Na'vi are rescued when Pandoran wildlife unexpectedly join the attack and overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa answering Jake's prayer. Quaritch, in an AMP suit, escapes his crashed aircraft and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. As Quaritch prepares to kill Jake's avatar, he is killed by Neytiri, who saves Jake from suffocation, seeing his human form for the first time. In the aftermath of the war, the RDA are expelled from Pandora; only some humans are chosen to stay, including Max and Norm. Jake is permanently transferred into his avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls, Neytiri, and Mo'at.",

He and his wife Letty Ortiz stay behind with his son Brian \"Little B\" Marcos, while the rest of the team, consisting of Roman Pearce, Tej Parker, Han Lue, and Ramsey, travels to Rome. A wounded Cipher arrives at Dom's home in the middle of the night. She tells him and Letty that Hernan Reyes's son Dante has turned her crew against Cipher and is using them to target Dom as revenge for his father's death and the loss of his family's fortune ten years prior. The next morning, when Little Nobody informs Dom and Letty about the unplanned Agency mission in Rome, they realize this as a setup and travel to Rome to rescue the team. In Rome, Tej, Han, and Ramsey break into a truck presumably containing the computer chip, only for them to realize it as a DM-79 sub-nautical neutron mine. Dante begins controlling the truck remotely, activating and releasing the bomb into the streets. Dom arrives and pushes the bomb into the Tiber River, minimizing the damage, and Letty is apprehended by the police. Aimes, the Agency's de facto leader since Mr. Nobody's disappearance, assumes that Dom and his team are responsible for the bombing and begins a manhunt. In Los Angeles, Dom and Mia's brother Jakob rescues Mia and Little B from a squad sent by Aimes to apprehend them, and with Mia's approval, takes Little B to a secret location in Portugal, where they will await Dom. Mr. Nobody's daughter Tess is convinced of the team's innocence and uses God's Eye, a mass surveillance computer program, to find Dom in Naples, informing him that Dante is in Rio de Janeiro. Dom challenges Dante to a race in Rio with Elena Neves's sister Isabel and his ally Diogo. In the ensuing race, Dante kills Diogo when Dom chooses to save Isabel and wins. Tess visits Letty at the black site, covertly wounding her in the process; this sends Letty to the prison's treatment center, where Cipher is present. Deducing that the black site is located in Antarctica, they must work together to escape. In London, Dom's team turns to Deckard Shaw for help, through the convincing of Han after a scuffle between himself and Deckard. Aimes apprehends Dom in Rio before Dante intercepts them on the same bridge where the two previously met for the first time during the vault heist. After a sniper injures Tess, Dante steals God's Eye from her. While Tess is taken to the hospital, Aimes allies with Dom to fight Dante. He locates Little B in Portugal and kidnaps him. As Dom is cornered by mercenaries, Jakob sacrifices himself to wipe them all out, allowing Dom to rescue Little B, and possibly killing him. Dante again corners the pair and acknowledges Aimes as a double agent working with him and his father, at which point the latter shoots down a plane carrying Roman, Tej, Ramsey, and Han, possibly killing them. Dom drives off the edge of the dam he and Little B are on to avoid another trap. Witnessing their escape, Dante triggers explosives planted onto the dam, intending to kill the pair. In Antarctica, Gisele Yashar, who was presumed dead, emerges from a submarine to rescue Letty and Cipher. A mid-credits scene shows that Luke Hobbs infiltrates an abandoned theatre with a team of agents where he is contacted by Dante, who tells him that he will be his next target for killing his father. Hobbs replies that he is not hard to find, and crushes the phone Dante contacted him on with his bare hands.",

    "plot": "Five months after Thaddeus Ross is elected president of the United States, he sends Sam Wilson and Joaquin Torres—the new Captain America and Falcon, respectively—to Oaxaca, Mexico, to stop the illegal sale of classified items stolen by Sidewinder and his mercenary group Serpent. Wilson and Torres recover the items, but Sidewinder escapes. Torres is excited to be taking on Wilson's former mantle of Falcon, but Wilson is hesitant to involve Torres in dangerous missions due to the pair not having superpowers like former Captain America Steve Rogers. After the mission, Wilson and Torres train with Isaiah Bradley, a super soldier who was imprisoned and experimented on by the U.S. government. Ross invites Wilson and Torres to a summit with world leaders at the White House, and Wilson accepts on the condition that Bradley is also invited. Ross asks Wilson to help him reform the Avengers. During the summit, Ross explains that a new metal, adamantium, has been discovered on \"Celestial Island\", which was formed when the Celestial Tiamut emerged in the Indian Ocean. The recovered items were the first refined samples of the metal and were stolen from a Japanese mining operation. To avoid an arms race, Ross proposes a treaty to govern adamantium's mining and distribution. As he is talking, the song \"Mr. Blue\" plays and causes several men, including Bradley, to begin shooting at Ross and other dignitaries. Apprehended by Ross's head of security, former Black Widow Ruth Bat-Seraph, the men regain their senses and deny any knowledge of the attack. While investigating, Wilson is ambushed by Sidewinder and captures him. Torres tracks a call on Sidewinder's phone to a hidden black site in West Virginia called Camp Echo One. Ross tries to salvage the treaty, but the Japanese government blames him for the theft of their adamantium and the subsequent White House attack. Ross realizes that the mastermind behind these events is Dr. Samuel Sterns, who gained advanced intelligence after being exposed to the blood of Bruce Banner / Hulk during the Abomination's rampage through Harlem. Ross imprisoned Sterns at Camp Echo One, publicly blamed him for the Abomination's actions, and promised to release him if Sterns helped advance him to the presidency. Wilson and Torres find Sterns and learn how he uses technology and the song \"Mr. Blue\" to control minds. He escapes while they are fighting mind-controlled soldiers. Ross sends Bat-Seraph to secure Camp Echo One, where she finds and helps Wilson and Torres. The trio meet with Wilson's military friend Dennis Dunphy, who has Sidewinder in custody. Wilson learns enough from Sidewinder to deduce Sterns's plan to destroy Ross's reputation. Wilson, Torres, and Bat-Seraph go to Celestial Island where Ross and Ozaki, the Prime Minister of Japan, are racing to claim ownership of adamantium. Sterns takes control of the minds of two American pilots and makes them attack the Japanese fleet. Wilson and Torres intercept the planes and convince the Japanese to stand down, but Torres is critically injured in the fight. Ross tells Wilson that he is dying of heart failure and had Sterns develop pills that have prolonged his life; Ross refused to release Sterns for fear that he would no longer make the pills, leading to Sterns's anger and plans for revenge. Wilson is consoled by his friend Bucky Barnes. Sterns kills Dunphy, who learned that the pills have been adding gamma radiation to Ross's body, and surrenders himself to Wilson. Sterns's arrest and connection to Ross are publicly revealed while the latter is at a press conference. Ross loses control of his emotions and transforms into a red Hulk, destroying part of the White House. Wilson injures Ross enough that he can be reasoned with, and reminds Ross of visits to Washington, D.C.'s cherry blossom trees with his estranged daughter Betty. Ross reverts to normal. After the incident, Bradley is exonerated, Wilson invites a recovering Torres to join the Avengers, and the treaty is ratified. Ross resigns and has himself incarcerated at the Raft, where Wilson and Betty visit him. In a post-credits scene, an imprisoned Sterns warns Wilson of a coming attack from other worlds.",

The recent events catch the attention of Rex Strickland, a soldier who oversees Imperium, a government operation at the site of the soon-to-be-decommissioned Area 51 for the capture and study of other symbiotes that have fallen to Earth. Mulligan, revealed to have survived his encounter with Carnage, is captured after being left for dead by another symbiote, who eluded Strickland's soldiers. He is bonded with one of many contained symbiotes and questioned by Imperium researchers Dr. Teddy Paine and Sadie \"Christmas\" to learn about the symbiotes' purpose on Earth before Strickland is ordered to bring Venom down. While attaching themselves to the side of an airplane bound for New York City, Eddie and Venom are attacked by the Xenophage tracking them and are forced to drop into the Nevada desert. Venom explains to Eddie that Xenophages were unleashed into the universe by symbiote creator Knull to retrieve a Codex, forged when a symbiote resurrects its host, which Knull hopes can free him from the prison the symbiotes trapped him in long ago. Having previously revived Eddie , Venom and Eddie are now carrying a Codex which the Xenophage has tracked to Earth. After being ambushed by Strickland and his team while barely escaping from them and the Xenophage, Eddie meets Martin Moon and his family of traveling hippies and alien enthusiasts who offer him a free ride to Las Vegas on their way to Area 51. Meanwhile, Mulligan's new symbiote informs Strickland of Knull's intentions for the Codex, which can only be destroyed if either Eddie or Venom dies. Arriving in Las Vegas, Eddie and Venom run into Mrs. Chen at a casino and Venom shares a dance with her before being ambushed by the Xenophage again. Strickland's team arrives, separates Venom from Eddie and takes them to Area 51 where Eddie reunites with Mulligan. Sadie frees Venom, who re-bonds with Eddie after Strickland shoots him. This attracts the Xenophage to the base, and Mulligan is killed in battle. Venom has the other confined symbiotes released, which bond with Sadie and other hosts to fight off the Xenophage, who has signaled to Knull that the Codex has been found. Knull sends more Xenophages through portals to Earth, overwhelming the symbiotes. Realizing he must sacrifice himself to destroy the Codex and save the universe, Venom merges with the Xenophages, leads them into acid tanks, and bids Eddie farewell before ejecting him as a mortally wounded Strickland sets off his grenades to destroy them. Teddy bonds with a symbiote to save Sadie from the explosion while Eddie falls unconscious as the base burns. Eddie later wakes up in a hospital, where a military official informs him that his actions with Venom at Area 51 have earned him an expungement, under the condition of keeping the events that transpired a secret. Arriving in New York City, Eddie gazes at the Statue of Liberty while remembering Venom. In a mid-credits scene, Knull declares that the universe is no longer safe from him now that Venom has fallen. In a post-credits scene, the bartender who was taken into custody by Strickland shortly after Eddie left for New York escapes the burned remains of Area 51. Nearby, a black cockroach crawls out of the rubble next to a broken vial that previously contained a sample of the Venom symbiote.",

    "plot": "Russell Pierce, a veteran armored car driver nearing retirement, and Travis Stolly, a rookie who aspires to be a police officer, team up for the first time on duty. While on duty, criminal mastermind Zoe ambushes them with Banner and Miguel. During the intense chase and being outmatched, Russell attempts to surrender the money from the truck for their life but discovering that the supposed money they are transporting are full of contrabands. Banner and Miguel's car flips over during a car chase after Russel throws the money contained the dye packs at their cars, but Zoe ultimately manages to hijack the armored car. Travis recognizes Zoe, and remembers their one-night stand the evening before. She had gotten him drunk on their date, and he told her everything about his work and the schedule of his route. Assuming that Banner and Miguel are dead after both of their vehicles have violently crashed, Zoe asks Russell and Travis to cooperate with her and reveals that her goal wasn't to steal the money or the contrabands from the truck but to rob the armored vehicle itself as she needs an armored truck in a plan to take $60 million cash pickup from a casino. Banner and Miguel survive the car accident. Unhappy that Zoe had abandoned them, they attempt to catch up with the armored car. Travis, feeling used by Zoe, still has feelings for her. Zoe confesses to Travis and Russel that several years ago, a fire broke out in the casino where her father worked as security guard. During the fire, the lockdown sequence was initiated to protect the money from catching fire but did not have manual overdrive for the personnel to get out to safety. Zoe's father sacrificed himself to hold the metal door for his co-workers to escape. Despite his heroism, the casino did not extend any compensation to her family for the faulty security system. The adult Zoe now plans to take the casino's money to get revenge. In front of the casino, Russell's wife Natalie finds him through mobile phone positioning, where she is taken hostage by Zoe and tied up in the car with Travis. As they approaching the vault, they encounter a photoshot of WWE Star Wrestler and Zoe lies to him that his rival is trashing him on the internet, causing him to leave the vault.

Russell reunites with Natalie, and Zoe says goodbye to Travis before leaving in a small plane she had prepared in advance. Afterwards, Russell and Travis are found not liable for the events by the police as they believe the duo are forced to do the robbery at gunpoint. Six months later, Travis becomes deputy sheriff and contacts Zoe who is now living in luxury in Bali. Meanwhile Russell, now retired, is running a bed and breakfast with Natalie. He receives a box of money from Travis and Zoe.

    "plot": "Hutch Mansell sits inside an interrogation room, heavily bruised and injured. Two FBI agents interrogate him about his identity; Hutch responds that he is simply \"nobody\". In a flashback, Hutch leads an ordinary, mundane life as an office worker with his emotionally estranged wife Becca, teenage son Brady, and young daughter Sammy. One night, two thieves break into their house with a gun. Brady and Hutch confront them, but Hutch does not attack them despite being armed with a golf club, and the thieves depart with Hutch's watch and some loose cash. Everyone thinks Hutch is a failure for not fighting, but he reveals to his brother Harry that he held back because he knew the burglar's gun was unloaded. His brother-in-law, Charlie, offers Hutch a gun for protection, which he initially refuses. Hutch offers to buy out his father-in-law Eddie's business, but Eddie considers it a bad offer. The following evening, Sammy realizes her cat bracelet is missing, so Hutch sets out to find it. Suspecting one of the thieves took it when they grabbed the cash from a bowl, he tracks them down. He recognizes one by a wrist tattoo and demands they return the bracelet, but leaves after realizing they do not have it and were likely robbing to pay for their infant's medical bills. While on a bus heading home, a group of intoxicated thugs boards the bus and begins harassing a young woman; Hutch calmly but brutally fights them off. Unbeknownst to him, the group's leader, Teddy, is the brother of Yulian Kuznetsov, a Russian crime lord safeguarding the mob's obshchak money (a common treasury used to settle disputes in the Russian mafia). During the fight, Hutch breaks Teddy's windpipe before performing a crude cricothyroidotomy with a straw to allow him to breathe, but he falls into a coma and has permanent brain damage, enraging Yulian. Hutch returns home and is bandaged by Becca, who knows of his past. He vents his frustrations about living a mundane life to her before they reaffirm their love for one another. Meanwhile, Yulian manages to identify and locate Hutch using his dropped metro card, and sends a team of mobsters to his home to capture him while blackmailing a United States Department of Defense official to uncover Hutch's past. Harry calls Hutch to warn him of Teddy's connection to Yulian and suggests he check with the Barber, Hutch's former government handler. When the mobsters arrive, Hutch hides his family and kills most of the attackers, but is tased and captured. While being transported in the trunk of a car, Hutch sprays a fire extinguisher into the car, causing a crash that kills the occupants and frees Hutch. Hutch returns home, sends his family away to safety, and monologues to the mortally-injured attackers that he is a former \"auditor\", an assassin employed by the United States Intelligence Community. On one job in Europe, Hutch spared a repentant target who later reformed and lived happily with a new family; wanting a similar peaceful life, Hutch retired and settled down. Realizing the injured attackers have died, Hutch retrieves a hidden cache of gold and money, burns the house down to hide all evidence, and steals his neighbor's Dodge Challenger. Two assassins attempt to kill Hutch's father, David, at his retirement home, but David, a retired FBI agent himself, discreetly kills them. Hutch uses his gold to buy his father-in-law's metal fabrication factory and booby traps the building before attacking the Russian mafia's headquarters and burning Yulian's obshchak money. Hutch visits Yulian at his club with a Claymore mine and offers one last chance to end the fighting, but Yulian refuses. Hutch leaves the club and is pursued by Yulian and his men to the factory, where he is met by Harry and David, who help Hutch kill several waves of mobsters. As they begin to recover from the waves of attackers, Yulian manages to get the drop on them, wounding Harry. All out of ammo, Hutch tackles Yulian armed with the claymore taped to a panel of bulletproof glass; the shield deflects the explosion, killing Yulian and injuring Hutch. The police arrive and take Hutch into custody, returning the film to the opening interrogation. The agents suddenly receive simultaneous phone calls, and Hutch is released without charges. Three months later, Hutch and his family have returned to everyday life and are buying a new house, when Hutch receives a call hinting that more trouble may be on the way. In a mid-credits scene, David and Harry are shown carrying guns in their family campervan, presumably across the border.",

    "plot": "Dom Cobb and Arthur are \"extractors\" who perform corporate espionage using experimental dream-sharing technology to infiltrate their targets' subconscious and extract information. Their latest target, Saito, is impressed with Cobb's ability to layer multiple dreams within each other. He offers to hire Cobb for the ostensibly impossible job of implanting an idea into a person's subconscious; performing \"inception\" on Robert Fischer, the son of Saito's competitor Maurice Fischer, with the idea to dissolve his father's company. In return, Saito promises to clear Cobb's criminal status, allowing him to return home to his children. Cobb accepts the offer and assembles his team: a forger named Eames, a chemist named Yusuf, and a college student named Ariadne. Ariadne is tasked with designing the dream's architecture, something Cobb himself cannot do for fear of being sabotaged by his mind's projection of his late wife, Mal. Maurice Fischer dies, and the team sedates Robert Fischer into a three-layer shared dream on an airplane to America bought by Saito. Time on each layer runs slower than the layer above, with one member staying behind on each to perform a music-synchronized \"kick\" (using the French song \"Non, je ne regrette rien\") to awaken dreamers on all three levels simultaneously. The team abducts Robert in a city on the first level, but unknown to any team member, his subconscious projections, trained to anticipate such a scenario, attack them. After Saito is wounded, Cobb reveals that while dying in the dream would usually awaken dreamers, Yusuf's sedatives will instead send them into \"Limbo\": a world of infinite subconscious. Eames impersonates Robert's godfather, Peter Browning, to introduce the idea of an alternate will to dissolve the company. Cobb explains to Ariadne that he and Mal entered Limbo while experimenting with dream-sharing, experiencing fifty years in one night due to the time dilation with reality. After waking up, Mal still believed she was dreaming. Attempting to \"wake up,\" she committed suicide and framed Cobb for her murder to force him to do the same. Cobb fled the U.S., leaving his children behind. Yusuf drives the team around the first level as they are sedated into the second level, a hotel dreamed by Arthur. Cobb persuades Robert that Browning has kidnapped him to stop the dissolution and that Cobb is a defensive projection, leading Robert to another third level deeper as part of a ruse to enter Robert's subconscious. In the third level, the team infiltrates an alpine fortress with a projection of Maurice inside, where the inception itself can be performed. However, Yusuf performs his kick too soon by driving off a bridge, forcing Arthur and Eames to improvise a new set of kicks synchronized with them hitting the water by rigging an elevator and the fortress, respectively, with explosives. Mal then appears and kills Robert before he can be subjected to the inception; he and Saito are subsequently lost in Limbo, forcing Cobb and Ariadne to rescue them in time for Robert's inception and Eames's kick. Cobb reveals that during their time in Limbo, Mal refused to return to reality; Cobb had to convince her it was only a dream, accidentally incepting in her the belief that the real world was still a dream. Cobb makes peace with his part in Mal's death. Ariadne kills Mal's projection and wakes Robert up with a kick. Revived into the third level, Robert discovers the planted idea: his dying father telling him to create something for himself. While Cobb searches for Saito in Limbo, the others ride the synced kicks back to reality. Cobb finds an aged Saito and reminds him of their agreement. The dreamers all awaken on the plane, and Saito makes a phone call. Arriving in Los Angeles, Cobb passes the immigration checkpoint, and his father-in-law accompanies him to his home. Cobb uses Mal's \"totem\" – a top that spins indefinitely in a dream – to test if he is indeed in the real world, but he chooses not to observe the result and instead joins his children.",

Po struggles to choose the right candidate as he does not want to lose his status, and he stumbles upon a corsac fox bandit named Zhen trying to steal ancient weapons from the Jade Palace. Po outsmarts Zhen and sends her to prison, but a group of mine workers tells him that Tai Lung has returned from the Spirit Realm and destroyed an entire quarry. Zhen reveals that Tai Lung's return was masqueraded by a sorceress known as The Chameleon, who can shape-shift into any animal she wants as well as copying various kung fu skills simply by touching them. Po and Zhen travel to Juniper City to take down The Chameleon, with the former little knowing that his fathers, worried that he will not stand a chance against her, are following them. After visiting a shifty tavern and fighting off the inhabitants, Po and Zhen soon arrive at Juniper City and are almost arrested, but escape to the Den of Thieves, where they receive aid from Han, the den’s pangolin leader, and Zhen’s old mentor. From there, Po and Zhen head to The Chameleon's lair until Po is captured. It is then revealed that Zhen has been acting as a double agent for The Chameleon, and was tasked to acquire Po's Staff of Wisdom, which has the power to access the Spirit Realm. Po almost manages to escape, but The Chameleon, taking Zhen's form, fools him and throws him off a cliff, much to Zhen's horror. He nearly falls to his death but is rescued by his fathers, who convince him that sometimes change can be good. Using the staff, The Chameleon summons every deceased kung fu master and steals their skills, including three of Po's past enemies; Lord Shen, General Kai, and the real Tai Lung. After defecting for good, the guilt-stricken Zhen reunites with Po and apologizes for betraying him, but he refuses to back down from facing The Chameleon, so she, Mr. Ping, and Li head back to the Den of Thieves to convince them to help them save Po. As they battle The Chameleon's army of Komodo dragons, Po tries to reason with The Chameleon to no avail, although she does give the staff back to him as she no longer needs it. They battle one-on-one, but when Zhen intervenes, The Chameleon turns into a Chimera of several kung fu masters. Eventually, she shifts into Po himself and fights him, and quickly traps him in a cage before reverting to her original form. Putting his trust in Zhen, Po gives her the staff, with which she bests The Chameleon. Po, who was only pretending to be trapped, defeats The Chameleon and returns all of the stolen kung fu to their owners, who show respect to Po and return to the Spirit Realm, with Tai Lung finally acknowledging Po as the Dragon Warrior, forcibly taking The Chameleon with him. While returning to the Valley, Po chooses Zhen as his successor, much to the dismay of Shifu, and trains her to become the next Dragon Warrior, becoming confident with his choice.",

Smaug's falling body crushes the Master of Laketown and his cronies, who were escaping on a boat with the town's gold. Bard becomes the new leader of Laketown and guides its people to seek refuge in the ruins of Dale. Thorin, now possessing the vast treasure in the mountain, searches obsessively for the Arkenstone, which Bilbo had previously found but kept hidden. Upon hearing that Laketown survivors have fled to Dale, he orders the entrance of the Lonely Mountain sealed off. Meanwhile, Galadriel, Elrond, and Saruman arrive at Dol Guldur and free Gandalf, sending him to safety with Radagast. They battle and defeat the Nazgûl and then face a formless Sauron, whom Galadriel banishes to the East. Azog, marching on Erebor with his vast Orc army, sends his son Bolg to Mount Gundabad to summon their second army. Legolas and Tauriel witness the march of Bolg's army, bolstered by Orc berserkers and giant bats. Thranduil and an Elf army arrive in Dale to reclaim treasure held by Dwarf king Thrór. To avoid war, Bard attempts to negotiate with Thorin, asking him to share the gold previously promised to Laketown, but Thorin refuses. That night, Gandalf arrives to warn Bard and Thranduil of Azog's army, but Thranduil dismisses him. Bilbo sneaks the Arkenstone out of Erebor and gives it to Thranduil and Bard to trade for treasures and prevent war. The next morning, a combined army of Elves and Lake-town men approaches the Lonely Mountain, and Thranduil and Bard reveal that they have the Arkenstone. Thorin believes it to be a ruse, but Bilbo reveals the truth, at the same time reprimanding Thorin for his greed. Thorin nearly kills Bilbo but is stopped by Gandalf. Thorin's cousin, Dáin arrives with his Dwarf army, and a battle looms until Azog's forces arrive. As Dáin leads his forces to face the Orcs, Gandalf convinces Thranduil to join forces against Azog's army. Azog splits his army, sending some of his forces to attack Dale, so Bard and Lake-town army return to the city to defend it. Inside Erebor, Thorin, realising his greed and selfishness, regains his sanity and leads his company to join the battle. He rides with Dwalin, Fíli, and Kíli to Ravenhill to kill Azog. Meanwhile, Tauriel and Legolas arrive to warn the Dwarves of Bolg's arrival, and Bilbo volunteers to relay the news to Thorin, using his magic ring to move through the combat unseen. Azog kills Fíli as Bilbo and the other Dwarves are forced to watch. Bolg overpowers Tauriel and kills Kíli, who has come to her aid. Legolas battles Bolg and eventually kills him. The Great Eagles arrive with Radagast and Beorn, and the Orcs are finally defeated. In the climax, Thorin engages Azog in a duel and kills him, but is fatally wounded. Bilbo reconciles with the dying Thorin, while Tauriel mourns Kíli. Thranduil advises Legolas to seek out a ranger in the north who goes by the name Strider. Thorin's company settles back into Erebor with Dáin as their new king. Bilbo bids farewell to the company's remaining members and journeys home to the Shire with Gandalf. As the two part ways on the outskirts of the Shire, Gandalf admits his knowledge of Bilbo's magic ring and warns him of it, although Bilbo assures him that he had lost the ring. Bilbo returns to Bag End to find his belongings being auctioned off because he was presumed dead. He stops the sale and tidies up his home, revealing he still possesses the ring.

    "plot": "A teenage boy awakens in an underground elevator without memory of his identity. A large group of male youths greets him in a large grassy area, called the \"Glade\", enclosed by massive stone walls. The \"Gladers\" have formed a rudimentary society, each taking on specialized roles. The boy learns that a vast maze encircles the Glade and is their only means of escape. During the day, designated \"Runners\" search the maze for an exit and return before its gate closes at sunset. After a fight with Gally, the boy remembers his name is Thomas. Thomas is attacked by Ben, a Runner who was stung and left delirious by a Griever, one of the biomechanical creatures that roam the maze at night. The Gladers force Ben into the maze, as there is no cure for his condition, and leave him to die. The next morning, Alby, the Glade's leader, and Minho, the lead Runner, retrace Ben's steps inside the maze. However, as the sun sets, Minho reappears near the gate, dragging a badly injured Alby who has been stung. Unable to reach the Glade in time, Thomas runs into the maze to help, leaving all three trapped. Thomas is chased by a Griever but manages to lure it into a closing passageway, crushing it. The three survive the night and return the next morning. A girl arrives in the elevator with two syringes of Griever anti-venom and a note saying she is the last to enter the Glade. She recognizes Thomas, but he does not remember her. Gally accuses Thomas of disrupting the peace between the Gladers and the Grievers and insists he be punished. However, Newt, Alby's second-in-command, designates Thomas as a Runner instead. Thomas, Minho, Frypan, Winston and Zart enter the maze to locate the Griever's corpse and retrieve a mechanical device inside of it. Minho later shows Thomas a maze model based on previous explorations and explains that numbered sections open and close in a fixed sequence. Thomas realizes that the device corresponds to a specific section of the maze. One of the anti-venom syringes is used on Alby, who recovers quickly. Minho and Thomas venture back into the maze with the device and discover a potential exit but are forced to retreat after a series of traps suddenly activate. Later that night, the maze entrance remains open, and additional gates open up, allowing Grievers to invade the Glade. Alby, Zart and many other Gladers are killed, leading Gally to blame Thomas for the chaos. Thomas, who has been experiencing fragmented memory flashes since his arrival, stabs himself with a severed Griever's stinger to recover his memories before receiving the last dose of the anti-venom. While unconscious, Thomas remembers that he and Teresa once worked for the World Catastrophe Killzone Department (WCKD), the organization behind the maze, and that all the Gladers are being used as test subjects for an experiment. He awakens and reveals his past. Having taken command overnight, Gally plans to sacrifice Thomas and Teresa to the Grievers, believing it will restore peace. However, several Gladers free them and enter the maze together, while Gally and a few Gladers stay behind. Jeff and several other Gladers are killed by Grievers as the rest escape through the maze exit. The Gladers eventually reach a laboratory strewn with corpses. In a video recording, a WCKD scientist, Ava Paige, explains that massive solar flares followed by a pandemic caused by the Flare virus has devastated the planet, and the Gladers were part of an experiment to find a cure for the virus. The recording ends with Paige shooting herself as armed personnel storm the lab. Gally, having been stung by a Griever while following the group, declares that they will never be free and fires a gun at Thomas. Minho spears Gally, but not before he fatally shoots Chuck. As Thomas breaks down crying over Chuck, masked soldiers arrive and escort them to a helicopter, which flies over a vast desert wasteland toward a ruined city. Later, the supposedly dead scientists gather in a room with Paige, who remarks that the experiment was a success and that the survivors are now entering Phase Two.",

The plant, located in an underground bunker at the end of a canyon, is defended by surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), GPS jammers, fifth-generation Su-57 fighters, and F-14 Tomcats. With the GPS spoofing making an attack by the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II unfeasible, Maverick devises a plan employing two pairs of F/A-18E/F Super Hornets armed with laser-guided bombs. However, instead of participating in and leading the mission himself, Maverick is ordered to train elite Top Gun graduates who will complete the mission, assembled by Air Boss Vice Admiral Beau \"Cyclone\" Simpson, who barely tolerates Maverick's presence in deference to Iceman. Maverick dogfights with his skeptical students, winning their respect, while talented but cocky and rude Lieutenant Jake \"Hangman\" Seresin clashes with likable but cautious Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw—son of Maverick's deceased best friend and radar intercept officer Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw. Maverick reunites with former girlfriend Penny Benjamin and reveals his promise to Rooster's dying mother that Rooster would not become an aviator. Rooster, unaware of this, resents Maverick for blocking his Naval Academy application and blames him for Goose's death. Faced with selecting Rooster for the mission, Maverick confides in Iceman, who tells him, \"It's time to let go\" and reassures him that both the Navy and Rooster need Maverick. Iceman soon dies from terminal cancer, and Cyclone removes Maverick as instructor. Believing Maverick's plan is impossible to execute, Cyclone relaxes the mission parameters, allowing for theoretically easier execution but predictably resulting in the pilots' deaths. During Cyclone's announcement, Maverick makes an unauthorized flight through the course, completing it in less time than stated in his original mission parameters, proving it can be done. Cyclone reluctantly appoints him as team leader. Maverick flies the lead F/A-18E, accompanied by a buddy-lasing F/A-18F flown by Lieutenant Natasha \"Phoenix\" Trace and weapon systems officer Lieutenant Robert \"Bob\" Floyd. Rooster leads the second strike pair, which includes Lieutenant Reuben \"Payback\" Fitch and WSO Lieutenant Mickey \"Fanboy\" Garcia. The four jets launch from an aircraft carrier, and Tomahawk cruise missiles destroy the enemy air base. The teams destroy the plant, but the SAMs open fire during their escape. Rooster runs out of countermeasures, and Maverick sacrifices his plane to protect him. Believing Maverick dead, all jets are ordered back to the carrier, but Rooster disobeys and returns to find Maverick on the ground being pursued by an Mi-24 attack helicopter. After destroying the gunship, Rooster is shot down by a SAM and ejects. The two rendezvous and steal an F-14 from the damaged air base. Maverick and Rooster destroy two intercepting Su-57s, but a third attacks as they run out of ammunition and countermeasures. Hangman, who was the mission's emergency action pilot, unexpectedly arrives in time to shoot it down, and the planes return safely to a jubilant flight deck. Later, Rooster helps Maverick work on his P-51 Mustang. Afterward, Rooster looks at a photo of their mission's success, pinned alongside a photo of his late father and a young Maverick, as Penny and Maverick fly off in the P-51.",

    "title": "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring",
    "plot": "In the Second Age of Middle-earth, the lords of Elves, Dwarves, and Men each receive Rings of Power. Unbeknownst to them, the Dark Lord Sauron forges the One Ring in Mount Doom, imbuing it with his power to control the other Rings and conquer Middle-earth. A final alliance of Men and Elves battles Sauron's forces in Mordor. Isildur of Gondor severs Sauron's finger, vanquishing him and returning him to spirit form, marking the beginning of the Third Age. The Ring corrupts Isildur, who takes it and is later killed by Orcs. The Ring is lost in a river for 2,500 years until it is found by Gollum, who has possessed it for over four centuries. The Ring abandons Gollum and is found by a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. Sixty years later, Bilbo celebrates his 111th birthday in the Shire with his old friend, Gandalf the Grey. He leaves the Shire for one last adventure, passing on his inheritance, including the Ring, to his nephew Frodo. Gandalf investigates the Ring, learns its true nature, and discovers that Gollum revealed two words during interrogation: \"Shire\" and \"Baggins.\" Gandalf warns Frodo to leave the Shire. As Frodo departs with his gardener friend, Samwise Gamgee, Gandalf heads to Isengard to seek counsel from his friend, the powerful wizard Saruman. Saruman reveals Sauron has dispatched his nine Nazgûl servants to retrieve the Ring. Gandalf immediately attempts to flee to warn Frodo, but is imprisoned by Saruman who has allied himself with Sauron, communicating with him via a palantír. Frodo and Sam join up with fellow hobbits Merry and Pippin and evade the Nazgûl before reaching Bree to meet Gandalf, who never arrives as Saruman captures him. A Ranger named Strider helps them get to Rivendell but they are ambushed on Weathertop by the Nazgûl, who wound Frodo with a Morgul blade. Arwen, Strider's beloved Elf, finds them, rescues Frodo, and takes him to Rivendell to be healed and reunite with Gandalf, who had escaped Isengard on a Great Eagle. That night, Arwen declares to Strider she is willing to sacrifice her immortality for their love. Learning of Saruman's betrayal from Gandalf and now realising that they are facing threats from both Sauron and Saruman, Arwen's father Lord Elrond holds a council of Elves, Men, and Dwarves, also attended by Frodo and Gandalf, that decides the Ring must be destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom. Frodo volunteers to take the Ring, accompanied by Gandalf, Sam, Merry, Pippin, the Elf Legolas, the Dwarf Gimli, Boromir of Gondor, and Strider—who is actually Aragorn, Isildur's heir and the rightful King of Gondor. Bilbo, now living in Rivendell, gives Frodo his old sword Sting, and a chainmail shirt made of mithril. The Company of the Ring is forced to travel through the Mines of Moria due to a storm summoned by Saruman. Gandalf warns Frodo that Gollum, released from Sauron's fortress, has been trailing them with the intention to reclaim the ring. They find the Dwarves of Moria dead and are attacked by Orcs and a troll. While they hold off the attack, they face Durin's Bane, a Balrog. The others escape as Gandalf confronts the Balrog and is pulled into darkness. The devastated Fellowship reaches Lothlórien, where Galadriel, the Elf-queen, tells Frodo that he alone can complete the quest and warns one will try to take the Ring. She shows him a vision of Sauron enslaving Middle-earth should he fail. Meanwhile, Saruman creates an army of Uruk-hai in Isengard to destroy the Fellowship, intending to betray Sauron and reclaim the ring for himself. The Fellowship travels to Parth Galen by river. As warned by Galadriel, Frodo wanders off and is confronted by Boromir, who attempts to take the Ring. Uruk-hai scouts ambush the group; their leader, Lurtz, mortally wounds Boromir as he fails to stop them from capturing Merry and Pippin. Aragorn arrives and kills Lurtz, comforting Boromir in his final moments, promising to aid Gondor in their conflict. Worried the Ring will corrupt his friends, Frodo decides to go to Mordor alone, but Sam insists on accompanying him, honouring Gandalf's promise to protect him. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli head to rescue Merry and Pippin while Frodo and Sam navigate the pass of Emyn Muil toward Mordor.",

    "plot": "Troubled former UFC middleweight fighter Elwood Dalton makes a living scamming fighters on the underground circuit. He is approached by Frankie, the owner of an unruly roadhouse in the Florida Keys community of Glass Key, who offers him a job as head bouncer. Initially hesitant, Dalton takes up the offer after narrowly averting a suicide attempt with a freight train that destroys his car. He takes a bus to Frankie's establishment, called simply the Road House, and befriends Charlie, a teenager who runs a bookstore with her father, Stephen. At the Road House, Dalton fends off a motorcycle gang working for local crime boss Ben Brandt and personally drives the injured thugs to the hospital, where he meets Ellie, a doctor who tends to his injuries. Staying in Frankie's disused houseboat, Dalton mentors the other bouncers and becomes popular with the locals. After an attempt on his life by gang leader Dell, Dalton finds him lying in wait at his houseboat with a shotgun. He throws Dell overboard but is unable to save him from being killed and eaten by a crocodile. Knox, a psychopathic enforcer, is tasked by Brandt's incarcerated father to hunt down Dalton. After an unexpected date with Ellie, Dalton is confronted at gunpoint by the Monroe County sheriff, who tells him to leave town. However, Ellie, revealed to be the sheriff's daughter, intervenes. She explains that her father is in league with Brandt, who has inherited his wealthy father's drug empire. Brandt meets Dalton at the Road House and taunts him about his past: In a UFC title fight against a friend, Dalton was overcome with rage and killed his opponent in the cage. Knox arrives with Brandt's men, and an all-out bar fight ensues, leaving Dalton badly beaten. Frankie admits that Brandt has been buying up property to build an expensive resort, but she is the lone holdout. Dalton decides to leave town but discovers that Charlie and Stephen are in the hospital after Brandt's men burned down their bookstore. Enraged, Dalton kills one of the thugs responsible and captures a sheriff's deputy making a large delivery of Brandt's illicit cash, framing the deputy for the murder and taking the money. The sheriff soon informs Dalton that Brandt has kidnapped Ellie and will exchange her for the money. Stealing a bomb-laden motorboat to reach Brandt's catamaran yacht, Dalton finds him with the sheriff, who tells him the kidnapping was a lie to lure Dalton aboard. However, Brandt reveals that he is holding Ellie hostage. Tempers flare as Knox approaches in his boat, but Dalton detonates the motorboat and finds Ellie below deck, attempting to smash a window. Fleeing the sinking yacht, Brandt recaptures Ellie while Dalton commandeers Knox's boat. Catching up to Brandt, Dalton and Ellie leap off as Brandt is launched on top of the Road House. Climbing up on a causeway, Knox carjacks a pickup truck and crashes into the Road House, leading to a brutal fistfight with Dalton. When Brandt orders him to kill Dalton, Knox snaps Brandt's neck instead. He prepares to finish off Dalton with a shard of wood, but Dalton gains the upper hand and repeatedly stabs Knox into submission. The sheriff arrives, agreeing to cover up for Dalton. As Frankie and Stephen begin to rebuild, Charlie says goodbye to Dalton as he waits for his bus out of town. Stephen discovers Dalton has left them the trunk of cash as the bus pulls away. In a mid-credits scene, Knox has survived and assaults the hospital staff, leaving in his gown.",

    "plot": "The Parrs (The Incredibles) and Lucius Best (Frozone) battle The Underminer in Municiberg. The superheroes prevent the villain from destroying city hall, but fail to stop him from robbing a bank and making his escape. The resulting massive property damage prompt the government to shut down the Superhero Relocation Program, ending financial assistance for the \"supers\". Violet's classmate and love interest, Tony Rydinger, discovers her superhero identity; Agent Rick Dicker accidentally erases Tony's entire knowledge of Violet instead of just this incident. Wealthy siblings Winston and Evelyn Deavor, who run the telecommunications company DevTech, propose secret missions to Helen, Bob, and Lucius, which are to be recorded and broadcast in a movement to regain public trust in superheroes. Winston chooses Helen for their initial missions as she has caused the least property damage. Initially reluctant to be away from her family and risking getting into trouble with the law, Helen accepts after a talk with Bob. Meanwhile, Winston rehouses the Parrs in a luxury mansion. Bob struggles in his new role as a stay-at-home parent, left to deal with Violet's dejection over Tony forgetting their first date, Dash's math homework, and the chaos of baby Jack-Jack's burgeoning superpowers. He suppresses envy for Helen and, at Lucius's advice, calls on Edna Mode to babysit Jack-Jack. Meanwhile, in the city of New Urbem, Helen encounters the supervillain Screenslaver, a hacker who can perform hypnosis through any screen. After preventing him from destroying a crowded hovertrain and thwarting his assassination attempt on an ambassador, she tracks his signals and infiltrates his base. Defeating him, she unmasks him only to discover a disoriented pizza delivery driver. At a party celebrating Helen's success, Winston announces a summit of world leaders to legalize the supers on live television, hosted aboard his luxury hydrofoil yacht, the Everjust, and attended by all \"supers\" coming out of hiding. Helen realizes Screenslaver lured her to a decoy double, and the pizza delivery driver was under the control of hypnotic goggles. Evelyn reveals herself to be the true Screenslaver and hypnotizes Helen, restraining her using her goggles and a freezing cell that negates her self-stretching superpower. Evelyn blames society's overdependence on the \"supers\" for the deaths of her and Winston's parents, as their father was shot by burglars after the newly outlawed supers Fironic and Gazerbeam did not answer his calls for aid, and their mother died of grief. Evelyn plans to sabotage her brother's summit to ruin the reputation of all \"supers\" once more and keep them outlawed in the hopes that the public will be safer with self-sufficient crimefighting. Evelyn lures Bob into a trap on the Everjust, goggling him too, and sends six hypnotized supers to subdue Violet and Dash. Lucius arrives to protect them but is overwhelmed and goggled as well. Violet, Dash and Jack-Jack escape in the Incredibile, the supercar once owned by Bob, and, deducing their parents are in danger, stow away on the Everjust. Onboard, Helen, Bob, and Lucius are forced to broadcast themselves, giving villainous speeches, subduing the ship's crew, and locking its course towards Municiberg at a disastrous pace. When the children arrive, Jack-Jack removes the goggles on Helen, who in turn frees Bob and Lucius. They work together to release the other mind-controlled supers and safely prevent the Everjust's collision with the city. Evelyn tries to escape in the yacht's parasite jet, but is then caught by Helen and arrested. With another disaster averted and the positive publicity surrounding this, supers around the world regain their legal status. Sometime later, Tony is picked up by Violet and her family in the Incredibile for their reinstated movie date. They spot a police chase; Violet leaves Tony at the cinema, promising a quick return, before the Parrs don their superhero masks and join the pursuit.",

    "title": "The Matrix",
    "plot": "In 1999, in an unnamed city, Thomas Anderson, a computer programmer known as \"Neo\" in hacking circles, delves into the mystery of the \"Matrix\". His search brings him to the attention of hacker Trinity, who discloses that the enigmatic Morpheus can answer Neo's questions. At his workplace, Neo is pursued by police and Agents led by Agent Smith. Morpheus guides Neo's escape by phone, able to somehow remotely observe their movements, but Neo ultimately surrenders rather than risk a hazardous getaway. The Agents interrogate Neo about Morpheus but he refuses to cooperate. In response, they seal Neo's mouth shut and implant a robotic device in his abdomen. Neo awakens at home, initially dismissing the encounter as a nightmare until Trinity and her allies arrive, extract the implanted tracker, and bring Neo to Morpheus, their leader. Morpheus offers Neo a choice: a red pill to uncover the truth about the Matrix or a blue pill to forget everything and return to his normal life. Opting for the red pill, Neo's reality distorts, and he awakens submerged in a mechanical pod with invasive cables running throughout his body. Neo witnesses countless inert humans similarly encased and tended to by machines before he is ejected from the facility and rescued by Morpheus aboard the hovercraft, the Nebuchadnezzar. Morpheus reveals that the year is approximately 2199. In the 21st century, humanity lost a war with their artificially intelligent creations, leaving the Earth a devastated ruin. As a last resort, humans blackened the sky to eliminate the machines' access to solar power and, in response, the machines developed farms of artificially grown humans to harness their bioelectric energy. The Matrix is a simulated reality based on human civilization at its peak, designed to keep the subjugated humans oblivious and pacified. The remaining free humans established an underground refuge known as Zion, living a harsh existence on scarce resources. Morpheus and his rebel crew hack into the Matrix to free and recruit others, manipulating the rules of the simulation to gain superhuman physical abilities. Even so, they are outmatched by the overwhelmingly powerful Agents—sentient programs protecting the Matrix—and dying in the Matrix causes death in the real world. Morpheus liberated Neo because he believes him to be \"the One\", a prophesied figure destined to dismantle the Matrix and liberate humanity. The crew enter the Matrix to seek guidance from the Oracle, the prophetic figure who foretold the existence of the One. She implies that Neo is not the One and warns him of an imminent choice between his life and Morpheus's. The crew are ambushed by Agents after being betrayed by Cypher, a disgruntled crew member who wants to be reinserted into the Matrix to enjoy its comforts. Convinced of Neo's importance, Morpheus sacrifices himself to confront Smith, only to be overpowered and captured. Meanwhile, Cypher exits the Matrix and begins forcefully disconnecting the others, killing them. Before Cypher can kill Neo and Trinity, Tank, a subdued crew member, regains consciousness, kills Cypher, and safely extracts the survivors. Smith interrogates Morpheus to obtain access codes for Zion's mainframe, which would allow them to end the human resistance. Determined to rescue Morpheus, Neo reenters the Matrix with Trinity. They successfully free Morpheus, who escapes the Matrix with Trinity, but Smith intercepts Neo. Gaining confidence in his abilities, Neo fights Smith, demonstrating comparable power and eventually killing him. However, Smith resurrects in a new body and kills Neo. In the real world, machines called Sentinels attack the Nebuchadnezzar. Standing by Neo's real body, Trinity confesses her love for him and that the Oracle prophesied she would fall in love with the One. In the Matrix, Neo revives with newfound abilities to perceive and control the Matrix. He effortlessly destroys Smith and exits the Matrix just as the Nebuchadnezzar's electromagnetic pulse disables the ship's power and the Sentinels. Sometime later, within the Matrix, Neo communicates with the system, promising to show the enslaved humans a world of limitless possibilities, before flying away.",

    "plot": "In late 1944, during the Lapland War, Aatami Korpi lives alone with his horse and faithful Bedlington Terrier while he searches for gold in the wilderness of Lapland in the gold rush. He uncovers a rich deposit, collects a large quantity of nuggets, and travels towards Rovaniemi. Along the way, Aatami encounters a large Waffen-SS platoon led by Obersturmführer Bruno Helldorf. Helldorf is destroying villages during their retreat towards Norway and has taken several Finnish women captive. Helldorf takes little interest in Aatami, letting him pass. Aatami is soon accosted by a second unit of SS soldiers who discover his saddlebags full of gold. They jeeringly decide to rob and kill him, but he swiftly kills them all instead. Alerted by the gunfire, Helldorf investigates and discovers the massacre and one of Aatami's gold nuggets. Helldorf and his tank pursue Aatami to the edge of a minefield, where Aatami's horse is killed by a landmine. Gathering up his gold while Helldorf and his men watch, Aatami intentionally detonates another mine to make his escape. Several soldiers are sent after him, but are quickly blown up by mines. Helldorf orders two of the captive women ahead to ensure a clear path. After retrieving Aatami's dog tag, Helldorf's second-in-command Wolf learns over the radio of Aatami's past. After losing his family while fighting as a Finnish Army commando during the Winter War, the vengeful Aatami became the legendary \"one-man death squad\" whom Joseph Stalin's Red Army nicknamed Koshchei (\"the Immortal\"). Helldorf defies his orders to continue retreating in order to hunt down Aatami and steal the gold, explaining to Wolf that Nazi Germany has already lost the war and they will need the gold to escape prosecution for war crimes. The German soldiers dispatch dogs to follow Aatami's trail. Aatami sends his own dog away before using petrol from one of the German trucks to cover his scent. However, the soldiers soon discover him and Aatami dives into a nearby lake. Helldorf sends three soldiers onto the lake in a boat, but Aatami kills two of them by slitting their throats underwater and breathes in the escaping air from their necks. The remaining German soldier attempts to flee, but is killed by Wolf. Aatami uses the soldier's body as a shield after reaching the riverbank and escapes. On the other side of the river, Aatami's dog is discovered by Helldorf. Aatami discovers that Rovaniemi has been left in burning ruins and takes shelter in the remains of a petrol station. Helldorf sends Aatami's dog to find him, but with a lit Stielhandgranate attached to his collar. Aatami saves his dog but is knocked down and stunned when the grenade explodes. Helldorf, Wolf and tank driver Schütze hang Aatami, taking the gold and leaving him for dead, but Aatami impales one of his wounds onto protruding rebar, saving his life. Some time later, a pair of German pilots land in search of fuel. Aatami kills the engineer and forces the surviving pilot to fly him ahead of Helldorf's platoon. Helldorf soon discovers the abandoned plane in their path with the pilot hanged by the same noose Wolf used on Aatami. As the convoy continues, Aatami climbs onto the truck holding the female captives, kills their guards and arms the women. Aino, the de-facto leader of the women, commandeers one of the trucks, allowing Aatami to leap onto Helldorf's tank while the women gun down the rest of the soldiers. Aatami pulls Wolf out of the tank before leaving him at the mercy of the women. Helldorf reaches a commandeered Soviet plane and kills Schütze before taking off with the pilot. Aatami fires at the plane, mortally wounding the pilot, and uses his pickaxe to get onboard in midair. Helldorf and Aatami engage in hand-to-hand combat. After Helldorf gets the upper hand, Aatami swiftly hooks a static line to a bomb before releasing it, dropping Helldorf to his death. After finding that the pilot is dead, Aatami straps himself in as the plane crashes into a swamp. Led by Aino, the freed women drive the commandeered German tank, with a beaten Wolf strapped to the turret, to an incredulous Finnish Army unit. Aatami crawls out of the swamp and reunites with his dog, before making his way to war-ravaged Helsinki. He enters a bank and empties his satchels of gold onto a teller's counter, then speaks for the first time with a request to exchange it for paper currency: \"Bills. Big ones, please.

    "title": "John Wick: Chapter 4",
    "plot": "In New York City, John Wick recovers and prepares to exact vengeance against the High Table while hiding underground with the Bowery King. He travels to Morocco and kills the Elder, the \"one who sits above the Table\". In response, the High Table sends the Marquis Vincent Bisset de Gramont with unlimited resources to kill John. The Marquis summons New York Continental Hotel manager Winston, joined by his concierge Charon, and chastises Winston for previously failing to kill John. As punishment, the Marquis strips Winston of his managerial duties and declares him \"excommunicado\", destroys the New York Continental, and executes Charon. The Marquis then enlists John's old friend, Caine – a blind, retired High Table assassin – to kill him, threatening to murder Caine's daughter. John seeks refuge at the Osaka Continental, operated by his friend Shimazu Koji. Caine and Chidi, the Marquis' second-in-command, arrive with High Table enforcers to investigate. Koji's daughter, Akira, evacuates the hotel before the High Table \"deconsecrates\" it, instigating a melee. John battles many armored personnel, culminating in a showdown with Caine. A \"Tracker\" (bounty hunter) named Mr. Nobody interrupts their fight, letting John escape after deeming the bounty on him insufficient. A wounded Koji attacks Caine on John's behalf until Caine reluctantly kills him but spares Akira. John returns to New York and meets a vengeful Winston at Charon's gravesite. Winston suggests invoking an old High Table tradition to challenge the Marquis to a duel. Winning would free John from obligations to the High Table, but he can only request a duel on behalf of a crime family. John travels to the Berlin headquarters of the Ruska Roma crime syndicate to seek readmission. His adoptive sister, Katia, requires that he kill Killa Harkan, a High Table member the Marquis paid to murder her father. Killa ambushes John at his nightclub, but with help from Caine and Mr. Nobody, John kills him and regains his status. Winston conveys John's challenge to the Marquis, acting as his \"second\", and requests that, if John wins, his excommunicado be revoked and for his own reinstatement as manager of the rebuilt New York Continental, funded by the High Table. However, if John loses, Winston would also die. In Paris, John and the Marquis finalize the duel's terms – dueling pistols at sunrise at Sacré-Cœur – under the Harbinger's moderation. The Marquis chooses a reluctant Caine as his proxy, while the Harbinger warns that John and Winston will be executed if either is late. The Bowery King arrives in Paris to give John a pistol and a ballistic suit. The Marquis sets a $40 million bounty on John to delay him. John fights off numerous assassins, unknowingly helped by Mr. Nobody. Mr. Nobody finally starts pursuing John, but ceases his pursuit when John saves Mr. Nobody's dog from Chidi. After Caine, Mr. Nobody, and Mr. Nobody's dog assist John in fighting off dozens of assassins – including Chidi, whom Mr. Nobody kills – on the Rue Foyatier, they reach the summit on time. John and Caine (standing in for the Marquis as proxy) wound each other through two rounds of dueling, and the third round comes to a halt when Caine seriously wounds John. Demanding the right to administer the coup de grâce, the Marquis eagerly swaps places with Caine. Winston chides the Marquis for his arrogance, revealing that John had not fired his third bullet. John then promptly executes the Marquis with a headshot, ending the duel. The Harbinger grants John and Caine (as well as his daughter) their freedom from the High Table and reinstates Winston as the Hotel Manager of the New York Continental. John reflects upon his life and marriage before collapsing from his injuries. Sometime later, back in New York, Winston and the Bowery King bid farewell to John at a gravestone with his name, located next to one for his wife Helen. In a post-credits scene, Caine returns to Paris to reunite with his daughter, but is approached by a vengeful, knife-wielding Akira.",

    "plot": "CIA cryptographer Charlie Heller is restoring an old Cessna as a present from his wife, Sarah, who leaves for a business trip in London. At the CIA's Decryption and Analysis division, Charlie has befriended a field agent, Jackson O'Brien, code name \"The Bear\", and an anonymous source, code name \"Inquiline\". Classified files from Inquiline reveal Special Activities Center Director and Charlie's boss, Alex Moore, disguised politically-motivated drone strikes as suicide bombings. Charlie is subsequently brought to CIA Director Samantha O'Brien, who informs him that Sarah has been killed in a terrorist attack. A grieving Charlie soon presents his own findings. After an arms deal gone wrong, the four assailants took Sarah and others hostage, killing her before escaping. Charlie identifies the suspects – Belarusian criminal Mishka Blazhic, South African ex-special forces operative Ellish, former Armenian intelligence officer Gretchen Frank, and elusive mastermind Horst Schiller, Sarah's killer – but Moore and his deputy, Caleb Horowitz, insist they are working to take down Schiller's entire network. Determined to avenge Sarah, Charlie confronts Moore with his incriminating orders that caused hundreds of civilian and allied casualties. Threatening to leak the information, Charlie demands the resources and mission specific training at \"The Farm\" to personally hunt down the four assailants. Sent to train with Colonel Robert Henderson at Camp Peary, the gun-shy Charlie excels at bomb-making, but Henderson declares he is simply not capable of killing. Searching Charlie's home and office, Moore and Caleb discover a CD he hid in a bar's jukebox, but realize he was bluffing. Henderson is ordered to eliminate Charlie, who bugged the files he left in Moore's office and has already left the country. Charlie tracks down Gretchen in Paris and follows a lock-picking tutorial to break into her apartment. He discovers Gretchen's appointment at an allergy clinic and takes a gun, but cannot bring himself to shoot her. Haunted by memories of Sarah, he traps Gretchen at the allergy clinic in a hypobaric chamber that he fills with pollen. Charlie demands to know Schiller's location, but is unwilling to let Gretchen die and releases her. Gretchen escapes to the street and is fatally struck by a van. Taking Gretchen's phone, Charlie flees to Marseille where Henderson corners him in a bar, but he sets off an explosion in the bathroom and escapes. He requests Inquiline's help and is smuggled to Istanbul, where Inquiline reveals herself as Davies, the Russian widow of a murdered ex-KGB officer, having taken his place as Charlie's source. They trace Blazhic to a luxury hotel in Madrid. Meanwhile, Samantha learns Moore has sent Henderson after Charlie, and distrusting her subordinate, deploys her own operative to protect Charlie. In Madrid, Charlie confronts Blazhic as he swims in the hotel's rooftop pool, having rigged scuba equipment to decompress the air between the pool's sheets of glass. When Blazhic refuses to cooperate, Charlie shatters the glass and sends him plummeting to his death. He is nearly apprehended by Henderson, who is attacked by Samantha's operative; in the struggle, Henderson is shot but kills the operative, and Charlie escapes. Caleb realizes that Charlie is communicating with someone and tracks down Davies. He contacts the Russian station chief at Istanbul and a Russian FSB strike team is sent to Istanbul, and Davies is killed as she flees with Charlie.

Charlie is captured and brought aboard Schiller's ship, coming face-to-face with Sarah's killer. Schiller offers him a loaded gun and the chance to take his revenge.

Moore and Caleb are arrested for their unsanctioned operations, and Samantha announces that the agency has purged its bad apples. After being visited by a recovered Henderson, Charlie finishes his plane's restoration and takes it for a flight.",

    "plot": "Following the death of his mother, Sergei Kravinoff and his half-brother Dmitri are taken by their father Nikolai Kravinoff to prepare to take over his drug trafficking operations. During a hunting trip in Ghana, Sergei is injured protecting his brother from a lion. The lion then brings him to a girl named Calypso, who heals him with a serum and calls for rescue, leaving a tarot card behind. Sergei soon discovers his physical attributes have become animalistic. When Nikolai reveals he killed the lion to teach his sons a lesson, a disgusted Sergei flees to an animal sanctuary owned by his mother in Russia. Sixteen years later, Sergei, now going by Kraven, is a vigilante who hunts criminals. After killing an arms trafficker in a Russian prison, Kraven travels to London for Dmitri's birthday. Their reunion is short-lived when mercenaries abduct Dmitri. When Nikolai refuses to pay the ransom, Kraven tracks down Calypso, now working as a lawyer, and convinces her to help. Meanwhile, Dmitri meets the man behind his kidnapping, Aleksei Sytsevich, who took part in an experiment granting him the strength and visage of a rhinoceros. Aleksei proposes an alliance to overthrow Nikolai. Discovering Kraven's connection to Dmitri, Aleksei lures him to a monastery in Turkey, but Kraven survives the ambush. Aleksei hires the Foreigner, an assassin who uses ocular hypnosis to disorient his targets, to kill Kraven. Tracking Kraven and Calypso to his sanctuary, Aleksei and the Foreigner ambush Kraven. Drugging him with neurotoxin, the Foreigner attacks Kraven but Calypso kills him with a crossbow and revives Kraven. He then uses a buffalo stampede to trap Aleksei, who, despite turning into the Rhino and briefly overpowering Kraven, is killed. Discerning that Nikolai was the one who revealed his existence to Aleksei, Kraven tracks his father for answers. Nikolai reveals that he knew Aleksei was targeting him and manipulated his sons to remove him. Kraven steals ammunition so that his father will be killed by a bear. One year later, Kraven visits Dmitri and is shocked that he has willingly inherited their father's criminal empire. Having gained shapeshifting abilities from the doctor who experimented on Aleksei, Dmitri reveals this to Kraven and states that despite his claims of being morally superior, he and Nikolai were the same: hunters searching for their next great trophy. At home, Kraven discovers a note from Nikolai along with a vest made from the skin of the killed lion from long ago, which he puts on.",

    "plot": "The hobbit Déagol discovers the One Ring in a river while fishing with his cousin Sméagol. The Ring immediately ensnares Sméagol's mind, and he kills his cousin for it. Corrupted physically and mentally, he retreats into caves below the Misty Mountains and becomes known as Gollum. Centuries later, during the War of the Ring, Gandalf leads Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and King Théoden of Rohan to Isengard, where they reunite with Merry and Pippin. Gandalf retrieves Saruman's palantír, and the group returns to Edoras to celebrate their victory at Helm's Deep. Pippin looks into the palantír, seeing Sauron and a burning tree. Gandalf deduces that the enemy plans to attack Gondor's capital Minas Tirith; he rides there with Pippin to warn Gondor's corrupt steward, Denethor. On Gandalf's instruction, Pippin triggers the lighting of the beacons to call for help from Rohan. Frodo, who carries the Ring, and Sam continue their journey towards Mordor, unaware that Gollum, now their guide, plans to betray them and take the Ring for himself. The trio witness the Witch-king of Angmar, lord of the nine Nazgûl, setting off towards Gondor with his army of Orcs. Gollum frames Sam for eating food supplies and desiring the Ring; Frodo is deceived and orders Sam to go home. As Théoden gathers his army, Elrond tells Aragorn that Arwen is dying, having refused to leave Middle-earth. Elrond gives Aragorn Andúril, reforged from the shards of King Elendil's sword Narsil, and urges him to claim Gondor's throne, to which he is heir. Aragorn travels the Paths of the Dead with Legolas and Gimli and pledges to release the ghosts there from their curse should they come to Gondor's aid. Gollum tricks Frodo into the giant spider Shelob's lair alone. Frodo narrowly escapes and confronts Gollum, who falls down a chasm after a scuffle. Shelob discovers, paralyses, and binds Frodo but is wounded and driven away by a returning Sam. Sam mourns Frodo's apparent death and takes the Ring to finish the quest himself, but then realises his mistake when Orcs take Frodo captive. He rescues Frodo within Mordor, and the two continue towards Mount Doom. Denethor sends his younger son, Faramir, on a suicide charge. Faramir returns gravely wounded; believing him dead, Denethor falls into madness. Gandalf marshals the defenders, but the enormous Orc army breaks into the city. Denethor attempts to burn himself and Faramir on a pyre, but Pippin alerts Gandalf, and they rescue Faramir; Denethor, set ablaze, jumps to his death. Théoden arrives and leads his army against the Orcs. Despite initial success in the ensuing battle, they are decimated by the Oliphaunt-riding Haradrim, and the Witch-king of Angmar mortally wounds Théoden; his niece Éowyn slays the Witch-king, with Merry's help, before Théoden dies in her arms. Aragorn arrives with his Army of the Dead, who overcome Sauron's forces. Their oath fulfilled, the Dead are released from their curse. Aragorn marches on Mordor to distract Sauron from Frodo and Sam's journey to Mount Doom, drawing all remaining forces to confront him. Gollum, having survived his fall, attacks, but Sam holds him back as Frodo enters the mountain. Frodo succumbs to the Ring's power and puts it on, but Gollum bites off his finger and reclaims the Ring, leading to a struggle before they tumble off the ledge. Frodo clings to the edge while Sam pulls him up, and Gollum falls into the lava with the Ring, destroying it and Sauron forever. The lands of Mordor collapse, annihilating the Orc army. Frodo and Sam narrowly escape the erupting Mount Doom, before Gandalf and the eagles rescue them. The surviving Fellowship members reunite in Minas Tirith. Aragorn is crowned King of Gondor and marries Arwen; everyone bows to the hobbits. The hobbits return to the Shire, where Sam marries Rosie Cotton. Four years later, Frodo, still suffering from trauma and a wound inflicted by the Witch-king, leaves Middle-earth for the Undying Lands with Bilbo, Gandalf, and the remaining Elves. He gives Sam the Red Book of Westmarch, detailing their adventures before departing and bidding farewell to Sam, Merry, and Pippin. A saddened Sam returns home and is comforted by his family.",

    "title": "Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings",
    "plot": "A thousand years ago, Xu Wenwu discovers the mystical ten rings which grant godly powers including immortality. He establishes the Ten Rings organization, conquering kingdoms and toppling governments throughout history. In 1996, Wenwu searches for Ta Lo, a village said to harbor mythical beasts. He travels through a magical forest to the village entrance but is stopped by a guardian, Ying Li. The two soon fall in love, but the Ta Lo villagers reject Wenwu so Li chooses to leave with him. They marry and have two children, Shang-Chi and Xialing. Wenwu abandons his organization and locks away the ten rings. When Shang-Chi is seven years old, Li is murdered by Wenwu's enemies, the Iron Gang. Wenwu dons the rings once again, massacres the Iron Gang, and resumes leadership of his organization. He makes Shang-Chi undergo brutal training in martial arts but does not allow Xialing to train, prompting her to secretly teach herself. When Shang-Chi is 14, Wenwu sends him to assassinate the Iron Gang's leader. After completing his mission, a traumatized Shang-Chi runs away to San Francisco and adopts the name \"Shaun\". In the present day, Shang-Chi works as a parking valet with his best friend Katy. They are attacked on a bus by the Ten Rings organization who steal a pendant that Li gave to Shang-Chi. Shang-Chi travels to Macau to find Xialing, fearing that the Ten Rings will go after her matching pendant. He reveals his past to Katy who insists on helping him. They find Xialing at a secret fight club which she founded after escaping from Wenwu at 16. The Ten Rings attack the fight club and Wenwu arrives to capture Shang-Chi, Katy, Xialing, and her pendant. At the Ten Rings' compound, Wenwu uses the pendants to reveal a mystical map leading to Ta Lo. Wenwu explains that he has heard Li calling and believes she has been held captive in Ta Lo behind a sealed gate. He plans to destroy the village unless they release her. When his children and Katy object, he imprisons them. They meet former actor Trevor Slattery, whom the Ten Rings imprisoned for impersonating Wenwu, and his hundun companion Morris. They escape and Morris guides them to Ta Lo, which exists in a separate dimension with various Chinese mythological creatures. The group meet Li's sister Ying Nan who explains the history of Ta Lo: thousands of years ago, the village's universe was attacked by the soul-consuming Dweller-in-Darkness and its soul eaters, but was saved by a Chinese dragon called the Great Protector who helped seal the Dark Gate to the Dweller's world. According to Nan, the Dweller-in-Darkness has been impersonating Li so Wenwu will use the ten rings to open the Gate. Shang-Chi, Xialing, Katy, Slattery, and Morris join the villagers in training and preparing for Wenwu's arrival, using outfits and weapons crafted from dragon scales that are effective against the soul eaters. Wenwu and the Ten Rings arrive and attack. Wenwu overpowers Shang-Chi, pushes him into the nearby lake, and attacks the Gate with the rings. This allows some of the Dweller's soul eaters to escape, with the Ten Rings allying with the villagers to effectively fight them. The Great Protector revives Shang-Chi and bears him from the lake to battle the soul eaters. Wenwu and Shang-Chi fight once more, and Shang-Chi gains the upper hand but chooses to spare Wenwu. The Dweller-in-Darkness escapes from the weakened Gate and attacks Shang-Chi. Wenwu saves Shang-Chi but is killed by the Dweller-in-Darkness; he bequeaths the rings to Shang-Chi before he dies. Shang-Chi, the Great Protector, Xialing, and Katy slay the Dweller-in-Darkness. Afterward, Shang-Chi and Katy return to San Francisco where the sorcerer Wong summons them to Kamar-Taj. In a mid-credits scene, Wong introduces Shang-Chi and Katy to Bruce Banner and Carol Danvers and the group discusses the origins of the rings. They discover that the rings are acting as a beacon to something. In a post-credits scene, Xialing becomes the new leader of the Ten Rings, despite telling Shang-Chi that she would disband the organization, and begins training women alongside men.",

    "plot": "In rural Massachusetts, retired school teacher Eloise Parker lives alone but shares a warm friendship with Adam Clay, a quiet beekeeper who works in her barn. One day, Eloise falls for a phishing scam that bankrupts her and steals her life savings, including over $2 million from a charity she runs; devastated, she commits suicide. Adam discovers her body, and FBI agent Verona Parker, Eloise's daughter, arrests him. After being cleared and released, Adam contacts a mysterious group called the \"Beekeepers\" for information to locate those responsible and avenge Eloise; after some searching, they trace the scammers to a call center near Springfield run by Mickey Garnett. Adam storms the call center, assaults Mickey's men, and burns it down. Mickey's boss, Derek Danforth, instructs Mickey to kill Adam, who brutally kills Mickey's men at the barn and severs some of Mickey's fingers on his right hand with a bandsaw. Mickey escapes and calls Derek to warn him about Adam, but Adam catches Mickey and kills him by tying him to his truck and sending it off a bridge, before picking up Mickey's phone and warning Derek that he is his next target. Derek alerts Wallace Westwyld, a former CIA director serving as the head of security for Danforth Enterprises, Derek's tech firm. Recognizing Adam as a former Beekeeper, Wallace alerts the CIA, who dispatches Anisette, a current Beekeeper, to kill Adam. Anisette ambushes Adam at a gas station, but he kills her after a fierce battle; the Beekeepers promptly declare neutrality. Verona and her partner, Matt Wiley, anticipate that Adam's next target is the Nine Star United Center in Boston, which oversees Derek's global scam call centers. Wallace rallies a black ops team led by Pettis and briefs them on the Beekeepers, revealed to be an elite clandestine human intelligence organization tasked with protecting the United States by any means while operating above and beyond governmental jurisdiction, with a strict organizational culture inspired by worker bees in a beehive. Pettis's team deploys to secure Nine Star and kill Adam, but tensions with an FBI SWAT team outside and manager Rico Anzalone's refusal to evacuate create confusion that allows Adam to incapacitate the SWAT team, kill Pettis and his men, and interrogate Anzalone. Verona and Wiley pursue Adam, who disarms Wiley and escapes. Verona and Wiley learn Derek is the son of Jessica Danforth, the current President of the United States, and warn FBI deputy director Jackson Prigg that Adam may attempt to kill her for Derek's misdeeds. Wallace sends Derek to accompany Jessica at their coastal mansion, which is protected by anti-Beekeeper mercenaries, as Beekeepers cannot harm the President's close associates, but Adam infiltrates the mansion during a party. After being spotted, Adam fights his way through the building, disarming and neutralizing the Secret Service Counter Assault Team and killing the mercenaries, while Jessica and Prigg confront Derek, who admits to abusing Wallace's CIA algorithms to rig Jessica's election. When Jessica threatens to reveal his crimes to the public, an enraged Derek shoots Prigg and prepares to execute Jessica, but Adam shoots him in the head and flees as Verona and Wiley arrive. Verona pursues Adam and holds him at gunpoint, but ultimately decides to let him go. Grateful, Adam nods at Verona before fleeing to the beach, where he dons his buried diving gear and disappears into the sea.",

    "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides",
    "plot": "Around 1750, some twenty one years after Captain Jack Sparrow acquired Sao Feng's map to find the Fountain of Youth and the Black Pearl stolen by Hector Barbossa, a castaway found in the ocean was brought to King Ferdinand at Cádiz, holding a ship's logbook of Ponce de León, who died 200 years earlier searching for the Fountain. Meanwhile Jack rescues his first mate, Joshamee Gibbs, from execution in London, only to get captured. Gibbs takes Jack's map, while Jack himself meets King George II, who wants him to guide an expedition to locate the Fountain before the Spanish Armada, led by The Spaniard. Barbossa joins the expedition, now as a privateer wearing a peg leg and having lost the Pearl, believed to be sunk. Jack escapes, leading Barbossa to later recruit Gibbs, who memorizes Jack's map before burning it, and they set sail aboard the British Navy ship HMS Providence. Captain Teague, Jack's father, tells Sparrow that the Profane Ritual is required to use the Fountain. Jack also hears of another Jack Sparrow recruiting a crew. The impostor is Angelica, Jack's former lover and daughter of Blackbeard, who practices voodoo magic as a brujo, and Jack is shanghaied aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge. The crew included Philip, a captured missionary, and zombie officers. Although Jack incites the human crew to mutiny, Blackbeard subdues the mutineers with a sword that allows him to control ships at sea. Blackbeard wants to find the Fountain because of a prophesied death by a one-legged man. Jack also learns from Angelica that the ritual requires water from the Fountain, a mermaid's tear, and two silver chalices located on Ponce de León's ship, the Santiago; both chalices are drunk, and the person who drinks the water with the tear gets all the years of life from the other. Angelica also shows Jack Blackbeard's collection of captured, miniaturized ships in bottles, including the Black Pearl. The Revenge sails to Whitecap Bay, where Blackbeard's crew captures the mermaid Syrena. Barbossa, Gibbs, and some of the British crew continue on foot after the Providence is attacked by mermaids. Syrena's tail becomes legs after being out of water; seeing that she cannot walk, Philip offers to carry Syrena. After their newfound love is used to extract the mermaid's tear, Syrena is left to die. Blackbeard sends Jack to get the chalices, taking the latter's magic compass. Jack and Barbossa meet on the Santiago, but find the chalices have been taken by the Spanish. Before retrieving the chalices, Barbossa reveals his true agenda: a desire for revenge against Blackbeard, detailing the attack on the Black Pearl, which Barbossa truly believes to be sunk, which led to cutting off his leg. Jack returns to Blackbeard, giving him the chalices in exchange for Jack's compass, which Jack sends off with Gibbs. All parties locate the Fountain of Youth, which leads to a battle, in which Barbossa uses a sword he poisoned using \"poisonous toads\" to stab Blackbeard. Angelica cuts her hand on the poisoned blade. The Spaniard throws the chalices into a deep pool and, believing it is an abomination against God, orders his men to destroy the Fountain. In the chaos, Philip frees Syrena, who gives the chalices to Jack. Filling the chalices with the remaining drops of water from the Fountain, adding Syrena's tear, Jack tricks Blackbeard into drinking the chalice lacking the tear; this earns his and Angelica's enmity. Angelica is healed, whilst Blackbeard dies. Syrena returns to an injured Philip and, after she forgives him, they kiss and return underwater. Barbossa claims Blackbeard's ship, crew, and sword for his own, and returns to a life of piracy. Meanwhile, Jack maroons Angelica on a small island, expressing his love and mistrust. Jack reunites with Gibbs, who uses the compass to locate the Revenge and retrieve the Black Pearl in a bottle. As they figure out how to get the Pearl out, Jack tells Gibbs he's determined to continue living the pirate's life. In the post-credits scene, the voodoo doll of Jack created by Blackbeard washes ashore and is picked up by Angelica, who smiles.",

    "plot": "In Russia, the media covers Tony Stark's disclosure of his identity as Iron Man. Ivan Vanko, mourning the death of his father Anton Vanko—a former Stark Industries employee, sees this and builds the same miniature arc reactor as Stark's using old Stark Industries blueprints left behind by Anton. Six months later, Tony wants to continue the legacy of his father Howard, and re-institutes the Stark Expo in New York City's Flushing Meadows–Corona Park. He also resists pressure to turn over his armored suits to the government and Stark's rival, Justin Hammer. However, Stark learns that the palladium core in the arc reactor that keeps him alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him, and he is unable to find a substitute. Growing increasingly despondent about his impending death, and refusing to tell anyone about his condition, Stark appoints his assistant Pepper Potts as CEO of Stark Industries and hires Stark employee Natalie Rushman to replace her as his assistant. Stark competes in the Monaco Historic Grand Prix, where he is attacked in the middle of the race by Vanko, who wields electrified whips powered by his arc reactor. Stark dons his armor and defeats Vanko, but the armor is severely damaged. Vanko explains that he intended to prove to the world that Iron Man is not invincible. Impressed by Vanko's performance, Hammer fakes Vanko's death while breaking him out of prison and asks him to build a line of armored suits to upstage Stark. Vanko decides that unmanned drones are better to eliminate the human factor. During his birthday party, Stark gets drunk while wearing the Iron Man suit. Annoyed by Tony's recklessness, Stark's best friend, U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes, dons Stark's prototype armor and tries to restrain him. The fight ends in a stalemate, and Rhodes confiscates the prototype armor for the U.S. Air Force. Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D., approaches Stark. Fury reveals that \"Rushman\" is S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Natasha Romanoff and that Fury personally knew Howard Stark, who was a founder of S.H.I.E.L.D. Fury explains that Vanko's father and Howard invented the arc reactor together, but Howard had Anton deported when the latter tried to sell it. The Soviets then sent Anton to the Gulag. Fury gives Stark some of his father's old material. In a diorama of the 1974 Stark Expo, Stark finds a diagram of the atomic structure of a new element. With the aid of his A.I., J.A.R.V.I.S., Stark determines it can replace his arc reactor's current palladium core, and successfully synthesizes it. When Stark learns that Vanko is still alive, he goes to Hammer's expo. The armored drones are unveiled, with Rhodes – in a heavily weaponized version of the prototype armor, dubbed \"War Machine\" – as their leader. Just as Stark arrives to warn Rhodes, Vanko takes remote control of all the drones and Rhodes's armor and attacks Stark. Hammer is arrested for breaking Vanko out of prison while Romanoff and Stark's bodyguard Happy Hogan infiltrate Hammer's factory. Vanko escapes, but Romanoff gains access to Hammer Industries software and returns control of Rhodes's armor to him. Together, Stark and Rhodes defeat Vanko, who dies by suicide via blowing up his suit and the drones. At a debriefing, Fury informs Stark that because of his difficult personality, S.H.I.E.L.D. intends to use him only as a consultant moving forward. Stark and Rhodes receive medals for their heroism. In a post-credits scene, S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson discovers a large hammer in New Mexico.",

Callum Drift, head of Santa Claus's security detail, plans to retire after one last Christmas run, having become disillusioned with people's increasingly toxic behavior, exemplified by the growth of Santa's Naughty List. On Christmas Eve, an unidentified black ops team breaks into the North Pole complex and kidnaps Santa. MORA director Zoe Harlow's subordinates discover that Jack O'Malley, a freelance black-hat hacker, compromised the complex's location. Zoe apprehends Jack for questioning. Jack, a longtime Santa skeptic, explains that he had no idea what the information meant and merely sent it to an anonymous buyer. Zoe hires Jack to help find Santa and places a tracker on him. Callum reluctantly teams up with Jack. They track down Ted, the broker who bought the information, in Aruba. Ted reveals the kidnapper is the winter witch Grýla. Grýla becomes aware of their conversation from her name being spoken and sends her snowmen henchmen to eliminate them. Although Callum and Jack are victorious, Ted is frozen before being questioned. Callum suspects that Grýla is working with Krampus, Santa's estranged adoptive brother, Grýla's ex-lover, and the Naughty List's creator. Callum and Jack break into Krampus' lair but are captured. Callum appeals to Krampus to help his brother, who misses him, but Krampus refuses. He reveals that Grýla came to him to recover the Glaskäfig, a magical imprisoning snow globe. Jack steals Callum's magic gauntlet back and returns it to him, allowing the pair to escape. Grýla and her sons keep Santa in a vault that siphons his magic, knocking him unconscious. Grýla duplicates the Glaskäfig, planning to imprison all the people who have ever been on the Naughty List. She successfully tests the snow globes on Jack and his estranged son Dylan. Jack and Dylan, inside their respective globes, have a heartfelt conversation that, by making them \"nicer,\" causes the snow globes to break. Following the implanted tracker, Zoe and Callum find Jack at the North Pole complex and realize that Grýla and her sons, along with Santa, have been inside the complex the entire time, having caused the search as a diversion. They also learn that Grýla's team of shapeshifters has taken over the complex. They find and free the imprisoned Mrs. Claus and other security staff. In Santa's old workshop, they find Jack, Dylan, and the equipment that Grýla used to mass-produce the Glaskäfigs. Grýla prepares to leave with an unconscious Santa, using his sleigh to distribute the Glaskäfigs. A fight ensues, and Grýla is stopped by Callum and Jack, with an assist from Krampus, who arrives to help. Santa recovers, defeats Grýla with the help of his reindeer, and seals her inside one of her Glaskäfigs. Santa and Krampus acknowledge each other and part ways peacefully. At the same time, Grýla is taken into Zoe's custody. Everybody prepares for the Christmas Eve run. Santa invites Jack and Dylan to accompany him. During the successful run, Callum watches Jack regain his wonder and build a relationship with Dylan. His faith is restored, and Callum decides against retiring.",

Deducing that Yokai was the mastermind behind the fire, Hiro weaponizes Baymax for defense, and Hiro's friends, whom Baymax contacted, meet up with them. Yokai pursues the group through the streets, but Baymax saves them. At Fred's house, Hiro upgrades Baymax and the group weaponizes their own inventions to combat Yokai. Believing Yokai to be Alistair Krei, a tech mogul who had wanted to buy the microbots at the showcase, the group tracks him to an abandoned Krei Tech laboratory on a remote island. They discover it was used for teleportation research, but the government shut it down after a prototype portal destabilized, trapping a test pilot inside. The group are soon ambushed by Yokai, but they manage to remove his mask and he is revealed to actually be Callaghan, who had faked his death using the stolen microbots. Hiro, enraged at Callaghan's indifference to Tadashi's death, removes Baymax's healthcare chip and orders him to kill Callaghan despite his friends' objections. Baymax obeys Hiro's commands before his healthcare chip is reinstalled by the rest of the group, returning him to his former personality as Callaghan escapes. Feeling betrayed by his friends' actions, Hiro leaves with Baymax, intent on avenging Tadashi. Back at home, Baymax recognizes Hiro's recklessness and shows him archived footage of his development, reminding him that Tadashi's goal was to help others. Through research, they and the rest of the group discover that the lost test pilot was Callaghan's daughter, Abigail. Now prepared to take revenge on Krei, Callaghan reactivates the teleportation portal to demolish his company's headquarters, but the heroes defeat him and save Krei. Baymax detects Abigail still alive inside the portal. Despite Krei's warnings about the portal being too unstable, Baymax and Hiro enter it and find Abigail trapped in stasis. Baymax is struck by debris, damaging him and forcing Hiro to leave him behind. Baymax uses his rocket fist to propel Hiro and Abigail out of the portal before it is destroyed. In the aftermath, the awakened Abigail is taken to the hospital while her father, now relieved that she is saved, is taken into custody for his crimes. Sometime later, after beginning his tenure at the institute with his friends, Hiro discovers Baymax's healthcare chip clenched in the rocket fist. He rebuilds Baymax and they and their friends continue to protect the city as a team of high-tech superheroes called Big Hero 6 on behalf of Tadashi. In a post-credits scene, Fred stumbles upon a secret lair within his home and reunites with his father, who was once a superhero.",

    "plot": "On a high school field trip, Peter Parker visits a Columbia University genetics laboratory with his best friend, Harry Osborn, and his love interest, Mary Jane Watson. There, he is bitten by a genetically engineered spider, and falls ill upon returning home. Meanwhile, Harry's father Norman tests a performance-enhancing chemical on himself in an attempt to secure a military contract for Oscorp, the company he founded. The chemical causes him to go insane and kill one of his scientists, Dr. Stromm. The next day, Peter develops spider-like abilities, including enhanced strength, senses, agility and speed, organic webbing in his wrists, and the ability to cling to walls. Hoping to buy a car to impress Mary Jane, Peter enters an underground wrestling event and wins his first match but is swindled out of his earnings. Soon after, Peter's Uncle Ben is killed by a thief who robbed the wrestling event, and whom Peter let escape. Peter pursues the thief, who eventually falls to his death. Meanwhile, a crazed Norman sabotages a product test by an Oscorp rival and kills several people. Upon graduating, Peter begins using his abilities to fight crime, donning a costume and adopting the alias \"Spider-Man\". J. Jonah Jameson, the publisher of the Daily Bugle newspaper, hires Peter as a freelance photographer, since he can provide high-quality images of Spider-Man. When Oscorp's board of directors decides to oust Norman and sell the company, Norman assassinates them while wearing a disguise during the Unity Day festival. As Spider-Man, Peter fends off Norman and rescues Mary Jane. Afterwards, Jameson bestows the name \"the Green Goblin\" upon the mysterious masked killer. Norman offers Peter a place at his side, but Peter refuses. They fight, and Peter flees after being wounded. Peter's Aunt May invites Mary Jane, Harry, and Norman for Thanksgiving dinner. Norman notices Peter's injury and deduces that he is Spider-Man. Later, Norman attacks and injures May, who is hospitalized. Peter is still unaware of the Goblin's identity but realizes that the Goblin is targeting his loved ones. While visiting the hospital, Mary Jane confesses to Peter her infatuation with Spider-Man, who has rescued her twice. Harry, who is dating Mary Jane, sees her holding Peter's hand and assumes she has feelings for him. A distraught Harry tells his father that Peter loves Mary Jane, unknowingly revealing Spider-Man's biggest weakness. That night, Norman captures Mary Jane and a Roosevelt Island Tramway car full of children. He tells Peter to choose whom to rescue, then drops them both from the Queensboro Bridge. Peter saves everyone, then lowers them onto a nearby barge for safety. An enraged Norman throws Peter into an abandoned building, then brutally beats him. After Norman reveals his intentions to kill Mary Jane, Peter finds the strength to fight back. Norman reveals his identity and begs forgiveness, discreetly preparing to impale Peter with his glider. Warned by his spider-sense, Peter dodges the attack, and the glider fatally skewers Norman instead. Before dying, Norman begs Peter not to reveal his identity to Harry. Peter takes Norman's body to the Osborn house, where Harry confronts him, but Peter escapes. At Norman's funeral, Harry vows revenge on Spider-Man, whom he falsely holds responsible for his father's death. Mary Jane then confesses to Peter that she loves him. However, Peter feels he must protect her from his enemies, so he hides his true feelings and tells her they can only be friends. As Peter leaves, he recalls his uncle's words: \"With great power comes great responsibility\".",

    "plot": "On Earth-65, Spider-Woman Gwen Stacy has become increasingly isolated from her friends and estranged from her father George. George is hunting Spider-Woman for killing Peter Parker, unaware that it was an accident after Peter turned into the Lizard. Gwen encounters a version of the Vulture from an Italian Renaissance–themed alternate universe, and Miguel O'Hara and Jess Drew arrive through dimensional portals to help neutralize him. George corners Gwen and she reveals her identity to him, and he attempts to arrest her before she leaves with Jess and Miguel. In Brooklyn on Earth-1610, 16 months after Kingpin's defeat and the destruction of the Alchemax collider, Miles Morales is having trouble with his parents due to his duties as Spider-Man interfering with his personal life, and is grounded when he is late to a party celebrating his father Jeff's promotion to police captain. Miles encounters the Spot, an Alchemax scientist-turned-supervillain whose body was infused with portals during the collider's destruction. The Spot blames Miles for causing his mutation and reveals that the radioactive spider that bit Miles and gave him his powers came from an alternate universe, Earth-42, while the Spot was testing the collider. The Spot accidentally transports himself into a void and learns to use his portals to travel to other universes and empower himself by using Alchemax colliders in other dimensions. Gwen travels to Miles' dimension, and they reconnect, sharing their struggles and hinting at feelings of attraction towards each other. Gwen secretly tracks the Spot and opens a portal to the next universe: Earth-50101. Miles discreetly follows Gwen into the portal, and the two team up with Earth-50101's local Spider-Man Pavitr Prabhakar, and later Hobie Brown, against the Spot. The Spot absorbs the power of that dimension's collider, and he and Miles share a vision of his future attacks, which include the deaths of Jeff and Police Inspector Singh, the father of Pavitr's girlfriend Gayatri. The Spot escapes and Miles saves Singh from the collider's destruction, but the world begins to collapse before other Spider-People arrive to contain the damage. Miles, Gwen, and Hobie are taken to Nueva York in Earth-928, where a multiversal society of Spider-People, known as the Spider-Society, work together to combat multiversal threats. Miles meets Miguel, the leader of the Society, and reunites with Peter B. Parker, who introduces him to his infant daughter: Mayday Parker. Miguel explains to Miles that each Spider-Person's story contains \"canon events\", such as the death of a police captain close to Spider-Man, which cannot be disrupted; otherwise, that universe may collapse, which in turn could collapse the entire multiverse as a consequence. Miles realizes that the Spot killing Jeff is a canon event and is imprisoned by Miguel to prevent him from saving Jeff. Miles frees himself with help from Hobie, and flees with the Society in pursuit. Miguel corners Miles and tells him that he was never supposed to become Spider-Man, blames him for the Spot's creation, and that Earth-42 has no Spider-Man because of him. Miles overpowers Miguel and, with help from Margo Kess, flees back to his own universe. Gwen stands up for Miles, and is angrily ejected to her own universe by Miguel. At home, Gwen reunites with George and they reconcile when he reveals he has decided to resign from the force instead of arresting her. George gives Gwen a makeshift portal device left for her by Hobie. Gwen uses it to travel to Earth-1610 and begins searching for Miles, as do other members of the Society. Miles tries to reveal his secret identity to his mother Rio, much to her confusion. Miles and Gwen realize that he is in Earth-42 and not his own earth. In Earth-42, Miles' late uncle Aaron Davis is alive while Jeff is dead, and New York is crime-ridden due to the lack of a Spider-Man. Aaron restrains Miles, and is joined by Miles' Earth-42 counterpart, the Prowler. Miles prepares to escape his restraints as the Spot begins his attack on Earth-1610's New York. Gwen, after promising to Rio and Jeff that she will find Miles, teams up with Peter B., Mayday, Pavitr, Hobie, Margo, Spider-Man Noir, Peni Parker, and Spider-Ham.",

    "plot": "Following the Battle of New York in 2012, Adrian Toomes and his salvage company are contracted to clean up the city, but their operation is taken over by the Department of Damage Control (DODC), a partnership between Tony Stark and the U.S. government. Enraged at being driven out of business, Toomes persuades his employees to keep the Chitauri technology they have already scavenged and use it to create and sell advanced weapons, including a flying Vulture suit Toomes uses to steal Chitauri power cells. Eight years later, after being drafted into the Avengers by Stark to help with an internal dispute in Germany, Peter Parker resumes his studies at the Midtown School of Science and Technology when Stark tells him he is not yet ready to become a full-time Avenger. Parker quits his school's academic decathlon team to spend more time focusing on his crime-fighting activities as Spider-Man. His best friend, Ned, eventually discovers his secret identity. Parker comes across Toomes's associates Jackson Brice / Shocker and Herman Schultz selling weapons to local criminal Aaron Davis. Parker saves Davis before being caught by Toomes in the Vulture suit and dropped in a lake, nearly drowning after becoming tangled in a parachute built into his suit. He is rescued by Stark, who is monitoring the Spider-Man suit he gave Parker and warns him against further involvement with the criminals. Toomes accidentally kills Brice with one of their weapons and Schultz becomes the new Shocker. Parker and Ned study a weapon Brice left behind, removing its power core. When a tracking device on Schultz leads to Maryland, Parker rejoins the decathlon team and accompanies them to Washington, D.C. for their national tournament. Ned and Parker disable the tracker Stark implanted in the Spider-Man suit, and unlock its advanced features. Parker tries to stop Toomes from stealing weapons from a DODC truck but is trapped inside, causing him to miss the decathlon tournament. When he discovers that the power core is an unstable Chitauri grenade, he races to the Washington Monument, where the core is activated and explodes, trapping Ned and their friends in an elevator. Parker saves them, including his classmate and crush Liz. Days later, in New York City, aboard the Staten Island Ferry, Parker captures Toomes's new buyer Mac Gargan but Toomes escapes and a malfunctioning weapon tears the ferry in half. Stark helps Parker save the passengers, but confiscates his suit as punishment for his recklessness. Parker returns to his high school life and asks Liz to go to the homecoming dance with him. On the night of the dance, he discovers that Toomes is Liz's father. Deducing Parker's secret identity, Toomes threatens him. Parker realizes Toomes is planning to hijack a DODC plane transporting weapons from Avengers Tower to the team's new headquarters in Upstate New York. He leaves the dance and dons his old homemade Spider-Man suit. Though he is ambushed outside by Schultz, he defeats him with Ned's help. He races to Toomes's lair, where Toomes attacks Parker, destroying the building's support columns, and leaves Parker to die, trapped in the rubble of the collapsed building. Gaining the motivation from his inner strength, Parker escapes and intercepts the plane, steering it to crash on the beach at Coney Island. He and Toomes continue fighting, ending with Parker saving Toomes's life after the damaged Vulture suit explodes. Parker leaves Toomes for the police along with the plane's cargo. After her father's arrest, Liz moves away. Parker declines an invitation from Stark to join the Avengers full time, and Stark proposes to Pepper Potts. Stark also returns the Spider-Man suit to Parker, who puts it on just as his aunt May walks in. In a mid-credits scene, an incarcerated Gargan approaches Toomes in prison, saying he has heard that the latter knows Spider-Man's real identity, though Toomes denies this.",

    "plot": "In the early 18th century, Governor Weatherby Swann and his daughter, Elizabeth, sail aboard HMS Dauntless captained by Lieutenant Norrington and his crew. They encounter a shipwreck and rescue a boy named Will Turner. Elizabeth notices a gold medallion around Will's neck and takes it while he is unconscious, before seeing a ghostly ship sailing away. Eight years later in Port Royal, Jamaica, Captain Norrington is being promoted to commodore while Will works as a blacksmith, and pirate captain Jack Sparrow arrives in Port Royal seeking a ship. Norrington proposes to Elizabeth atop a cliff, but she faints and falls into the ocean, causing the medallion she is carrying to emit a pulse. Jack rescues Elizabeth and discovers the medallion. Governor Swann orders Jack's execution after he is identified as a pirate, but Jack flees into Will's smithy, where he is caught after Will duels him to a stalemate. That night, Port Royal is attacked by the pirate crew of the Black Pearl, who are in search of the medallion. They take Elizabeth hostage aboard the ship to meet Captain Barbossa after she identifies herself as \"Elizabeth Turner\". Barbossa explains that the medallion is one of 882 cursed gold pieces used to bribe Hernán Cortés to stop his slaughter of the Aztecs. After finding and stealing the cursed gold at Isla de Muerta, the crew became cursed undead zombies who cannot feel pleasure or pain. To lift the curse, the crew has returned all the gold with an offering of blood from each member, but one medallion belonging to \"Bootstrap\" Bill Turner, a crew member thrown overboard after the theft, is missing. Believing Elizabeth to be Bootstrap's child, Barbossa intends to use her blood for the ritual. Will frees Jack, and they steal the HMS Interceptor. They escape to Tortuga to recruit a crew from Joshamee Gibbs, who reveals Jack as the previous captain of the Black Pearl, whom Barbossa mutinied against and marooned on a deserted island. On Isla de Muerta, they sneak into the treasure grotto where Barbossa fails to lift the curse using Elizabeth's blood. Will and Elizabeth escape with her medallion, but Jack is captured and imprisoned on the Pearl. A battle erupts between the ships, crippling the Interceptor. When Will learns that Bootstrap was his father, he surrenders, but threatens to kill himself unless Elizabeth and the crew are left unharmed. Barbossa imprisons the crew and maroons Jack and Elizabeth on the same island that Jack was previously exiled to. Jack reveals that the island was used as a rum smuggling cache for rum runners, who rescued him after only three days. Elizabeth signals for help using a bonfire fueled by the rum, leading the Royal Navy to rescue them. She agrees to marry Norrington if he saves Will from Barbossa. Jack and Norrington enact a plan to ambush the pirates at Isla de Muerta, but Jack reveals himself to the pirates and convinces Barbossa to delay lifting the curse until after killing Norrington's men. In the battle, Jack hides a medallion for temporary immortality, frees Will, and duels Barbossa. Elizabeth frees Jack's crew on the Pearl, but they refuse to help her save Will and Jack. Jack shoots Barbossa just as Will returns his and Jack's medallions to the chest with their blood, breaking the curse and killing Barbossa. The rest of the pirates are either killed or captured by the Navy. At Port Royal, where Jack is to be imminently hung for his crimes, Will declares his love for Elizabeth before rescuing Jack. Jack and Will are surrounded by Norrington's soldiers, but Elizabeth stands with Will, forcing Governor Swann to order the soldiers to stand down. Jack falls into the sea and is picked up by the Black Pearl. Norrington accepts that Elizabeth loves Will, and decides to give Jack a head start before pursuing him. Governor Swann gives his blessing to Will and Elizabeth, while Jack becomes captain of the Pearl once again. In a post-credits scene, Jack, Barbossa's pet monkey, climbs onto the chest of gold in the cave on Isla de Muerta and takes a coin from it, becoming undead once more.",

    "plot": "In a world where humans and anthropomorphic animals co-exist, master pickpocket Mr. Wolf leads the Bad Guys, an infamous gang of criminals consisting of his best friend and safecracker Mr. Snake, expert hacker Ms. Tarantula, master of disguise Mr. Shark, and loose cannon Mr. Piranha. After yet another brazen robbery and police chase, Governor Diane Foxington insults the gang's predictability. Wolf convinces them to steal the Golden Dolphin award, which will be presented to guinea pig philanthropist Professor Rupert Marmalade IV, who has helped rebuild the city from damage by a meteorite. Infiltrating the awards ceremony, Wolf feels a sense of accomplishment after inadvertently assisting an elderly woman, but his conflicted feelings delay the gang's escape, ultimately leading to their arrest. To avoid prison and reclaim the award, Wolf persuades Diane to let Marmalade reform the Bad Guys' criminal ways. Marmalade's efforts to reform the gang are unsuccessful, culminating in a disastrous attempt to rescue guinea pigs from a research lab. Diane angrily scolds them for their \"behaviour\" and nearly calls off the experiment, but sympathizes with Wolf for acting like the \"big bad villain\" society expects of him. Wolf finds himself rescuing a cat from a tree, captured by Marmalade in a video that turns the gang's public image around, but Snake fears that Wolf is losing sight of their plan. At Marmalade's charity gala, the gang executes another heist to steal the award. Wolf, having fallen in love with Diane, is unable to do it and decides to redeem himself. However, the meteorite is stolen instead, and the gang is blamed and arrested, while a remorseful Wolf gives Diane the location of the gang's hideout full of stolen loot. Marmalade reveals to the gang that he stole the meteorite and arranged everything to frame them, including posing as the old woman at the awards ceremony. Wolf attacks and lashes out angrily at Marmalade, out loud in front of the audience, including Diane. In prison, Wolf explains that he believes a better life is possible, leading to a fight with Snake, who is convinced that he was betrayed by his dearest friend. The gang is rescued by Diane, whom Wolf realizes is the Crimson Paw, a former criminal mastermind and now convinced that Wolf is truly redeemed. Wolf agrees to help Diane stop Marmalade from using the meteorite as a hypnotic power source, but the others return to their hideout only to discover their loot is gone. Snake comforts Shark by giving him the last Push Pop, leading them all to realize that Wolf was right about a better life, but an angry Snake storms off in denial to ally with Marmalade. Diane and Wolf realize Marmalade is using the meteorite to control an army of guinea pigs, which he sends to rob his charity funds throughout the city. Diane reveals that when she tried to steal the Golden Dolphin, she realized she was the type of person that society perceived her to be, and left her criminal ways behind. Attempting to steal back the meteorite, Marmalade and Snake capture them. Tarantula, Shark, and Piranha arrive to rescue them, and together, they race to deliver the meteorite to the police but decide to bring Snake back first. Chased by the guinea pig swarm, Wolf is forced to surrender the meteorite when Marmalade kicks Snake out of his helicopter. Reconciling with Snake, the police confront the gang, while Marmalade's mind control device is destroyed. Before Diane can defend the gang by revealing her criminal past, Wolf and the others willingly turn themselves in. Marmalade tries to claim credit for recovering the meteorite, but Snake revealed that he faked his defection and had the meteorite swapped with Marmalade's replica lamp when he had the mind control device. The machine destroys the meteorite, exposing Marmalade as the real thief, while he inadvertently frames himself as the Crimson Paw after the diamond he took from Diane falls out of his pocket, leading to his arrest. As the police take the Bad Guys to jail, Wolf reveals that he left the Push Pop to prove there was good in Snake, and the gang happily accepts that they are now good guys.",

Meanwhile, eight years after the death of Gotham City District Attorney Harvey Dent and the arrest of the Joker, organized crime has been eradicated in Gotham by the Dent Act, legislation that gives expanded powers to the police. Police commissioner James Gordon has kept Dent's killing spree a secret and allowed the blame for his crimes to fall on Batman. Bruce Wayne, still mourning the death of Rachel Dawes, has become a recluse, and Wayne Enterprises has stagnated. Bane conspires to help Wayne Enterprises board member John Daggett take over the company, and they begin by trying to buy Bruce's fingerprints. Burglar Selina \"Catwoman\" Kyle steals Bruce's prints from Wayne Manor for Daggett, but he double-crosses her, and she alerts the police, who pursue Bane and Daggett's henchmen into the sewers while Catwoman flees. The henchmen capture Gordon and take him to Bane, but he escapes and is found by Gotham City police officer John Blake, an orphan who has deduced Bruce's secret identity and persuades him to resume his vigilantism. Bane attacks the Gotham Stock Exchange and uses Bruce's fingerprints to verify a series of fraudulent transactions, leaving Bruce ousted from his company and bankrupt. Batman resurfaces to pursue Bane's henchmen. Fearing Bruce will get himself killed fighting Bane, his butler, Alfred Pennyworth, resigns in the hope of saving him after admitting to burning a letter that Rachel left for him saying she was going to marry Dent. Bane expands his operations and kills Daggett while Bruce and Wayne Enterprises' new CEO, Miranda Tate, become lovers. Catwoman agrees to take Batman to Bane but instead leads him into a trap under Wayne Tower. Bane gloats that he intends to fulfill Ra's al Ghul's mission to destroy Gotham City before he brutally cripples Batman in combat. He then takes Bruce to an ancient underground prison in the Middle East, where Bruce learns that Ra's al Ghul's child was born and raised in the prison but had a protector that aided the child in escaping, thought to be impossible. Back in Gotham, Bane detonates explosives to trap the police forces in the sewers, destroys all but one bridge surrounding the city, kills Gotham mayor Anthony Garcia at the Gotham City stadium, and forces Pavel to convert the fusion reactor core owned by Wayne Enterprises into a decaying neutron bomb before publicly killing him as well. He exposes Dent's crimes to the city and releases the prisoners of Blackgate Penitentiary, taking over the city, and has Gotham's elite exiled and killed in proletarian kangaroo courts presided over by Jonathan Crane. Five months later, Bruce escapes captivity and returns to Gotham. As Batman, he frees the police, and together they clash with Bane's army in the streets. During the battle, Batman overpowers Bane, but Tate stabs Batman in the abdomen, revealing herself as Ra's al Ghul's daughter Talia al Ghul. Talia also reveals that Bane was her protector in the pit before activating the bomb's detonator, but it fails due to Gordon blocking the signal, so Talia leaves to find the bomb while entrusting Bane to finish off Batman. However, Catwoman returns, killing Bane and helping Batman pursue Talia, hoping to return the bomb to the reactor chamber where it can be stabilized. Talia's truck crashes, but she remotely floods and destroys the reactor chamber before dying. With no way to stop the detonation, Batman, after revealing his identity to Gordon, uses his aerial craft, the Bat, to haul the bomb far over the bay, where it safely explodes. In the aftermath, Batman is presumed dead and honored as a hero. Since Bruce is also presumed dead separately, Wayne Manor becomes an orphanage, and Bruce's estate is left to Alfred. Gordon finds the Bat-Signal repaired, while Lucius Fox discovers that Bruce had fixed the Bat's malfunctioning auto-pilot. In Florence, Alfred discovers that Bruce is alive and in a relationship with Selina, and they silently acknowledge each other before parting ways. Blake, whose legal first name is revealed as Robin, resigns from the GCPD and receives a package leading him to the Batcave.",

    "title": "KPop Demon Hunters",
    "plot": "Long ago, demons preyed on humans, feeding their souls to their ruler Gwi-Ma. Eventually, three women appeared as demon hunters and used their singing voices to create a magical barrier against demons called the Honmoon. As time passed, new trios of hunters emerged to maintain the Honmoon, with the ultimate goal of strengthening it into the Golden Honmoon—a final seal that would banish demons permanently. In the present, the K-pop girl group Huntr/x—comprised of Rumi, Mira, and Zoey—are the latest demon-hunting trio, trained by former hunter Celine. Rumi is secretly half-demon, a fact known only to her and Celine, who raised Rumi. Disquieted by the demonic patterns gradually spreading across her skin, Rumi pushes forward the release and live performance of Huntr/x's new single, \"Golden\", hoping it will turn the Honmoon gold and thereby erase her patterns. However, as they prepare for the performance, Rumi begins to lose her voice. In the demon world, Gwi-Ma grows enraged at his minions' failures. Five demons, led by former human Jinu, form a boy band called the Saja Boys to steal Huntr/x's fans and weaken the Honmoon, in exchange for Gwi-Ma erasing Jinu's human memories. Watching their debut, Huntr/x quickly discover the Saja Boys' demonic nature and attack them after a variety show. As they fight, Jinu discovers Rumi's patterns, but helps hide them from her bandmates. Meeting privately, Jinu tells Rumi that feelings of shame enslave demons through voices from Gwi-Ma. He tells her that 400 years prior, Gwi-Ma granted him a beautiful voice that helped his family emerge from poverty, but then condemned him to the demon world; Jinu now lives with guilt over his family's downfall. As the Saja Boys grow more popular, the Honmoon is weakened, allowing more demon attacks to occur. With the Idol Awards approaching, Huntr/x rush to produce a new song, \"Takedown\", to expose the Saja Boys. Rumi's discomfort with the song's harsh, demon-hating lyrics strains her relationship with Mira and Zoey. Rumi proposes a plan to Jinu: if he helps Huntr/x win the Idol Awards and strengthen the Honmoon, he could freely stay in the human world. Later, Rumi tells Jinu that her shame about her demon heritage weakened her voice, but talking with him healed it. Jinu says that he no longer hears voices, thanks to Rumi, and agrees to sabotage the Saja Boys. Gwi-Ma summons Jinu, reminds him of the truth that he abandoned his family for a life of wealth and comfort, then threatens to amplify the tormenting voices if he reneges on their deal. At the Idol Awards, Huntr/x perform \"Golden\", having chosen to shelve \"Takedown\" due to the contention it caused between them. However, impostor demons sent by Jinu lure Mira and Zoey away from Rumi, then pose as them to trick Rumi into performing \"Takedown\", during which they publicly reveal her patterns. She flees the stage and runs into the real Mira and Zoey, who feel betrayed upon learning of her hiding her demon nature and collusion with Jinu from them. Rumi confronts Jinu for tricking her, and he admits to lying about his past. Gwi-Ma, strengthened by the influx of consumed souls and decaying Honmoon, enters the human world and casts a trance over the public, including Mira and Zoey, drawing them to the Saja Boys' final performance. A desperate Rumi meets with Celine and asks her to end her life. Celine refuses and discusses plans to restore the status quo. Rumi lashes out at Celine for never fully loving her, then leaves. Rumi interrupts the Saja Boys' performance with an impromptu song addressing shame and self-acceptance, breaking Mira and Zoey out of Gwi-Ma's trance. Reunited, Huntr/x fight back and free the crowd. A repentant Jinu sacrifices himself to save Rumi from an attack by Gwi-Ma, giving his restored soul to reinforce her; the empowered Huntr/x defeat Gwi-Ma and the Saja Boys, re-sealing the demons and creating a new Honmoon. Afterward, Rumi, no longer ashamed of her patterns, reconciles with Mira and Zoey, and they later meet their fans in public.",

    "plot": "Following the defeat of Professor Marmalade and their recent release from prison, the Bad Guys have since reformed but struggle to fit into society. Wolf, Shark, Piranha, and Tarantula unsuccessfully apply for jobs while Snake is frequently away from home. Wolf spends his time with Diane and they grow closer, but they cannot start a relationship due to him being an ex-criminal and her being governor. Inspired by Diane to give people a reason to accept them, Wolf helps Commissioner Luggins track down the Phantom Bandit, a new criminal known for being untraceable. They soon find evidence leading to the bandit being Snake, only to later realize he was with his new girlfriend, Susan. In an attempt to expose the Phantom Bandit at a lucha libre wrestling tournament, the Bad Guys are framed by a pig for the Phantom Bandit's work. After escaping from the scene, Wolf calls Diane to maintain their innocence and she agrees to help them. The Bad Guys are kidnapped by a trio of female criminals: Kitty Kat, Pigtail Petrova, and Doom. Kitty was the Phantom Bandit, Pigtail was the pig who framed the Bad Guys, and Doom used the name \"Susan\" as an alias and was using Snake to lure the Bad Guys. Kitty recruits them to help steal the experimental MOON-X rocket, using secret video footage revealing Diane as the Crimson Paw—her former criminal identity—as blackmail; the Bad Guys reluctantly agree. Meanwhile, Diane visits Marmalade in prison, where he reveals that Kitty plans to use the International Space Station to steal all of the world's gold with MacGuffinite, a rare metal which can magnetize gold. The group begins their plan by successfully stealing the smartwatch of MOON-X's owner, Mr. Moon, at his wedding. Kitty gives Wolf the footage on a flash drive as promised, but betrays and traps the Bad Guys after they record her confession. Kitty then uploads the footage to the internet and alerts the police of the Bad Guys' location; the video uploads despite their efforts to stop it, and Diane's secret identity is revealed globally. Diane confronts the girls before they board the rocket, but Kitty reveals that the footage is now live. A devastated Diane is tranquilized by Kitty while distracted, but manages to sneak on board while half-conscious. Luggins proceeds to rearrest the Bad Guys, but admits that she trusts them and helps them board the rocket mid-launch via helicopter. After learning the Bad Guys snuck onboard, Doom and Pigtail refuse to attack them, but Kitty refuses to give up the plan and overpowers the machine, endangering millions of people while magnetizing more gold, along with a limo including a newly-acquitted Marmalade. When Wolf reaches her, Kitty breaks the magnet's remote, but Wolf pickpockets the smartwatch and maneuvers the rocket into the magnet, destroying it and returning the gold. An enraged Kitty attempts to kill Wolf for ruining her plan, but Diane recovers and defeats her. Wolf and Diane happily reunite and share their first kiss, while the Bad Guys regroup as the space station plummets towards Earth. After crash-landing, Kitty is arrested, Doom and Pigtail are sentenced to community service, and Luggins fakes the deaths of the Bad Guys and Diane so they can be employed as secret agents for the government. Still in orbit, Marmalade transforms his limo into a spaceship and flies into space to his home planet.",

    "plot": "On planet Turo, Dr. Jumba Jookiba is convicted by the United Galactic Federation of illegal genetic experimentation, for creating an aggressive, near-indestructible creature with advanced learning capabilities called Experiment 626. Jumba is imprisoned, while 626 is exiled for his destructive behavior. However, 626 escapes by stealing a police cruiser and using its hyperdrive to reach Earth, crashing on Kauaʻi. The Grand Councilwoman offers Jumba freedom if he recaptures 626, pairing him with Earth expert, Agent Pleakley. 626 crashes near a wedding reception and is run over by a tourist trolley before being taken to an animal shelter. A Hawaiian girl named Lilo Pelekai is expelled from hula school for pushing her bully Mertle off stage due to frustration over her sister Nani's absence. Their social worker, Mrs. Kekoa, visits and finds Nani unfit to care for Lilo, demanding she complete her tasks in three days. The next day, having heard that Lilo wants a friend, their neighbor Tūtū takes Lilo to the animal shelter where 626 is kept. Realizing Jumba and Pleakley are after him, 626 impersonates as a dog and allows Lilo to adopt him for his protection. Nani takes them to her resort lūʻau job with her friend David Kawena. Lilo names 626 \"Stitch\" after Nani comments on having to stitch a car seat he tore. They enjoy the resort, but Stitch accidentally causes a table fire, leading to Nani's dismissal. Nani is visited by Kekoa and Cobra Bubbles, a CIA agent posing as Kekoa's social director to investigate Stitch's arrival. Kekoa insists that Nani find new employment immediately. However, she is rejected after many interviews due to Lilo and Stitch's antics. Lilo helps Nani secure a job as a surfing instructor, and they enjoy surfing after her first shift. Meanwhile, Jumba and Pleakley fail to capture Stitch while jet skiing, causing the Pelekais and Stitch to wipe out, almost drowning Lilo when Stitch sinks. After Lilo's recovery, Kekoa informs Nani that the Hawaiian government will cover her health insurance costs if she relinquishes her guardianship—a decision she reluctantly accepts. As the sisters share a final night together, Stitch reflects on his actions and forlornly returns to the animal shelter alone. Meanwhile, the Grand Councilwoman, frustrated with Jumba's failure to capture Stitch, cancels their deal and orders Pleakley to return Jumba to prison. However, Jumba escapes Pleakley and plans to capture Stitch instead. Kekoa and Bubbles arrive the next morning to find that Lilo is missing, so they and Nani start searching for her. Lilo finds Stitch at the shelter, but Jumba arrives to recapture Stitch. They escape to the Pelekais' home and fight Jumba, destroying their house. During the battle, Jumba reveals that Stitch used Lilo for his protection, leading to guilt-ridden Stitch's surrender. Jumba takes Stitch aboard his spaceship using a portal-generating gun, intending to erase Stitch's newfound empathy. However, Lilo sneaks aboard and frees Stitch, and they eject Jumba from the ship. The ship crashes into the ocean, trapping Lilo and Stitch underwater. Stitch rescues her, but as he cannot swim to the surface, he releases her to let her emerge and drowns. Nani and David rescue Lilo, but she refuses to leave Stitch. David returns Lilo to shore while Nani swims back to get Stitch from the ocean floor. They reach shore, but Stitch remains unconscious. After Bubbles finds Pleakley and they rejoin the group, David revives Stitch by jump-starting his lungs. Shortly after, the Grand Councilwoman arrives and re-arrests Jumba. After seeing Stitch's change of heart, she decides to let Stitch exile on Earth with his newfound ʻohana. The Grand Councilwoman vows to keep in touch, with Pleakley living with the Pelekais to watch over Stitch. As the Pelekais, Stitch, and company return home, Kekoa tells Nani she can transfer Lilo's guardianship to David and Tūtū, letting her stay home. The ʻohana then repairs the house and lives happily. In a mid-credits scene, Nani, now attending the University of California, San Diego to study marine biology with Lilo's blessing, uses Jumba's portal gun to visit Lilo and Stitch in Kauaʻi.",

    "title": "The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie",
    "plot": "In the town of Grandview, a scientist discovers an asteroid heading towards Earth, but then discovers a UFO hurtling alongside it, which crashes onto Earth. When he goes to investigate, he vanishes. Years earlier, Daffy Duck and Porky Pig were raised by a farmer named Jim, who left everything to the duo under the promise that they would learn the power of responsibility through relying on each other. In the present, Daffy and Porky fail a home inspection when the inspector Mrs. Grecht points out a gigantic hole in their roof (caused by the UFO). With little time to repair their house before it is condemned, the duo is forced to come up with money to pay for the repairs. After being fired from multiple jobs due to Daffy's antics, the duo come across Petunia Pig, a scientist working at the Goodie Gum factory trying to find the perfect flavor. She offers the two a job at the factory and they accept. After completing their first shift with no issues, Daffy discovers the scientist pouring green goo into the gum supply. Recognizing the goo as the same residue lining the hole in their roof, Daffy tries to alert Porky, but he dismisses it as paranoia. The new gum flavor is launched worldwide, and Daffy realizes everyone chewing the gum gets turned into a zombie. He tries to warn the public at the launch party, only to get arrested after he annoys the Mayor. Consequently, he and Porky are fired. After a frustrated Porky bails Daffy out of jail, the duo meet up with Petunia again. Daffy asks her to investigate a gum sample, and she discovers an alien invader is responsible for contaminating the gum. The Invader turns the gum into a sentient monster to eliminate the three from thwarting his plans, but they are able to defeat it. Getting an idea, the three conceive a plan to spray people with Petunia's rotten egg extract in order to make them spit out the gum and burn it while in mid-air. Concerned that Daffy will only get in the way, Porky tells him to stay behind and lay eggs in order to produce more extract. Porky and Petunia are successful in their plan, until Daffy decides to step in and try to fight back as well, causing him to accidentally destroy their weapons. Petunia is captured, while Porky and Daffy are abducted by the Invader. With all of Earth's population under his control, the Invader initiates the second step in his plan, which has everyone blow a bubble big enough to encase the entire planet. Daffy and Porky escape confinement, managing to free Petunia and the scientist as well and popping the bubble. However, it turns out the Invader was trying to protect Earth, as the asteroid from earlier is still hurtling towards the planet; his plan was to use the gum bubble as a shield to bounce the asteroid away, saving Earth and its precious resource of boba tea that he cherishes dearly. Remembering Petunia's exploding gum, the three, with the help of the Invader and the scientist, enter a weak spot in the asteroid and place a surplus of the gum by a large crystal, where a surplus of wind-up novelty teeth will chew up the gum. When the teeth are accidentally tipped over, Porky instructs Daffy to go crazy, where his antics cause stalactite crystals to fall and \"chew\" the gum. However, when the three attempt to escape, Daffy gets stuck and Porky refuses to leave his side. The asteroid explodes before hitting Earth and Daffy and Porky are presumed dead. Whilst everyone on Earth celebrates, Daffy and Porky are revealed to have survived as they crash-land on Earth stuck to a large asteroid crystal, much to the joy of Petunia, who kisses Porky and also discovers the crystals are the missing ingredient for her perfect gum flavor. As Daffy and Porky examine their destroyed house, Porky discovers behind a family portrait he saved earlier that Farmer Jim left them a $5 million home insurance contract, thus allowing them to build a new house. Mrs. Grecht returns for a follow-up inspection, only for Porky, Daffy, Petunia, the Invader and the scientist to flex their new mansion to her, causing her head to explode.",

    "plot": "In the mid-21st century, humanity faces extinction due to dust storms and widespread crop blights. Joseph Cooper, a widowed former NASA test pilot, works as a farmer and raises his children, Murph and Tom, alongside his father-in-law Donald. Cooper is reprimanded by Murph's teachers for telling her that the Apollo missions were not fabricated. During a dust storm, the two discover that dust patterns in Murph's room, which she first attributes to a ghost, result from a gravitational anomaly, and translate into geographic coordinates. These lead them to a secret NASA facility headed by Professor John Brand, who explains that 48 years earlier, a wormhole appeared near Saturn, leading to a system in another galaxy with 12 potentially habitable planets located near a black hole named Gargantua. Volunteers of the Lazarus expedition had previously traveled through the wormhole to evaluate the planets, with three — Miller, Edmunds, and Mann — reporting back desirable results. Cooper is enlisted to pilot the Endurance spacecraft through the wormhole as part of a mission to colonize a habitable planet with 5000 frozen embryos and ensure humanity's survival. Meanwhile, Professor Brand would continue his work on solving a gravity equation whose solution would supposedly enable construction of a spacecraft for an exodus from Earth. Cooper accepts against Murph's wishes and promises to return. When she refuses to see him off, he leaves her his wristwatch to compare their relative time when he returns. The crew, consisting of Cooper, robots TARS and CASE, and scientists Dr. Amelia Brand (Professor Brand's daughter), Romilly, and Doyle, traverse the wormhole after a two-year voyage to Saturn. Cooper, Doyle, and Brand use a lander to investigate Miller's planet, where time is severely dilated. After landing in knee-high water and finding only wreckage from Miller's expedition, a gigantic tidal wave kills Doyle and waterlogs the lander's engines. By the time they leave the planet, Cooper and Brand discover that 23 years have elapsed on the Endurance. Having enough fuel left for only one of the other two planets, Cooper and Romilly decide to go to Mann's planet, despite Brand's protests, as he is still broadcasting. En route, they receive messages from Earth and Cooper watches Tom grow up, marry, and lose his first son. An adult Murph is now a scientist working on the gravity equation with Professor Brand. On his deathbed, Professor Brand confesses that the Endurance crew was never supposed to return, knowing that a complete solution to the equation was not feasible without observations of gravitational singularities from inside a black hole. On Mann's planet, they awaken him from cryostasis, and he assures them that colonization is possible, despite the extreme environment. During a scouting mission, Mann attempts to kill Cooper and reveals that he falsified his data in the hope of being rescued. He steals Cooper's lander and heads for the Endurance. While a booby trap set by Mann kills Romilly, Brand rescues Cooper with the other lander and they race back to the Endurance. Mann is killed in a failed manual docking operation, severely damaging the Endurance, but Cooper is able to regain control of the station through his own docking maneuver. With insufficient fuel, Cooper and Brand resort to a slingshot around Gargantua, which costs them 51 years due to time dilation. In the process, Cooper and TARS jettison their landers to lighten the Endurance so that Brand and CASE may reach Edmunds' planet. Falling into Gargantua's event horizon, they eject from their craft and find themselves in a tesseract made up of infinite copies of Murph's bedroom across moments in time. Cooper deduces that the tesseract was constructed by advanced humans in the far future, and realizes that he had always been Murph's \"ghost\". He uses Morse code to manipulate the second hand of the wristwatch he gave her before he left, giving Murph the data that TARS collected, which enables her to complete Professor Brand's solution. The tesseract, its purpose fulfilled, collapses before ejecting Cooper and TARS. Cooper wakes up on a station orbiting Saturn. He reunites with Murph, now elderly and on her deathbed, who tells him to seek out Brand. Cooper and TARS take a spacecraft to rejoin Brand and CASE, who are setting up the human colony on Edmunds' habitable planet.",

    "plot": "After the death of his parents, young Elio Solís is orphaned and lives with his aunt Olga, an Air Force major who gave up her dreams of becoming an astronaut to raise her nephew. Elio wanders into a closed exhibit on the Voyager 1 spacecraft, where he is awed by the idea of discovering other life in space. Years later, Elio wishes to be abducted by aliens. Every day, he lies on the beach waiting, but without result. One night, a kid named Bryce and his bully friend Caleb tamper with Elio's ham radio, leading to a fight that injures his left eye, forcing him to wear a patch over his eye for two weeks. At Olga's workplace, Elio sneaks into an emergency meeting where conspiracy theorist Gunther Melmac claims to have found evidence of aliens responding to Voyager, suggesting they send a message back, but is dismissed by Olga and her colleagues. Elio uses Melmac's device to send his message, causing a power outage at the military base, nearly costing Olga her job. Angered by Elio's actions, Olga decides to send him to a youth camp, which he dreads, as Bryce and Caleb are also there. At camp, Elio escapes from Bryce, Caleb, and two other bullies one night as they attempt to scare him. Back at the military base, Olga receives strange outer space messages in response to Elio, who is then abducted by an alien ship. Inside the spaceship, Ooooo, a liquid supercomputer, welcomes him to the Communiverse, a place where aliens from different worlds share their knowledge. Other ambassadors mistakenly declare him a candidate for Earth's ambassador, thinking he created the Voyager spacecraft. Before Elio can clarify, they attend an emergency meeting with Lord Grigon, a rejected warlord threatening to take the Communiverse by force. The ambassadors plan to return Elio to Earth, but he chooses to negotiate with Grigon for immediate induction as an ambassador. Ooooo creates a clone of Elio to take his place back on Earth. Olga brings Other Elio home from camp after hearing about the prior fight. Meanwhile, Elio attempts to negotiate with Grigon, but after unintentionally angering him, he is imprisoned. While trying to escape, he comes across Grigon's son, Glordon, and decides to use him as a bargaining chip to get Grigon to leave the Communiverse alone. They head back to the Communiverse, where Elio gives Glordon a disc that modulates his body temperature. Grigon agrees to leave them in peace in exchange for Glordon's safe return. Elio and Glordon confide in each other; Elio feels alone and misunderstood by his aunt, while Glordon resists becoming a war machine like his father. Elio devises a cloning plan to keep them together; he puts the real Glordon on an escape shuttle and gives the clone to Grigon, who quickly notices the switch and enlists the mind-reading powers of Ambassador Questa to locate his son. Grigon sends troops to find Glordon, while Questa, disappointed by Elio's deception, returns him home to evade Grigon. Meanwhile, Glordon accidentally activates the shuttle, heading toward Earth. Back home, Elio is devastated but soon spots his aunt on the beach looking for him with Other Elio, whom she had already suspected was not her real nephew. After reconciling, they head to the military base, where Elio's shuttle has been contained. Other Elio sacrifices himself to distract the military, while Elio and Olga sneak into the base to find Glordon in the shuttle, whose disc broke from the impact of the landing, and is now suffering hypothermia. They pilot the shuttle back to the Communiverse, calling Bryce, Melmac and worldwide orbital scientists for help traveling through a debris field. Reaching the Communiverse, they return Glordon to Grigon, who rips his suit open to swaddle him, saving his life, and apologizes to his son and the ambassadors. Elio is welcomed back into the Communiverse, but declines the offer, deciding that Earth is his home, and bids his friends farewell before returning to Earth with Olga.",

    "plot": "A Chaos Pearl, birthed from the primordial essences of heaven and earth, begins siphoning energies gluttonously. The Supreme Lord Yuanshi Tianzun dispatches his disciples Taiyi Zhenren and Shen Gongbao to subdue the sentient pearl. Due to its ability to absorb energy, Taiyi and Shen are unable to defeat it. Tianzun uses the Seven-Colored Sacred Lotus to separate the pearl into two opposite components: the Spirit Pearl and the Demon Orb. Tianzun places a heavenly curse upon the Demon Orb: in three years time, it will be destroyed by heavenly lightning. Tianzun then instructs Taiyi to take the Spirit Pearl to be reincarnated as the third son of Li Jing in the town of Chentang Pass, to be named Ne Zha. Blinded by jealousy, Shen steals the Spirit Pearl and causes Li Jing's pregnant wife Lady Yin to give birth to Ne Zha as the reincarnation of the Demon Orb. Taiyi tells them that Ne Zha's fate is sealed: in three years' time the heavenly curse placed upon the Demonic Orb will kill him. Li travels to Heaven with Taiyi in an attempt to plead for Ne Zha's life, but is told the curse is irremovable. Meanwhile, Shen brings the stolen Spirit Pearl to the Dragon King of the East Sea. The Dragon King infuses the Spirit Pearl into an egg, giving birth to his third son, Ao Bing, whom the Dragon King allows Shen to take as a disciple. The dragons resent that they are confined to the ocean floor as prisoners of the Heavenly Court, and hope that since Ao Bing is born from the Spirit Pearl, they will be deemed worthy by Heaven and allowed to ascend and become xian (immortals). To tame his demonic nature and make him happy, Ne Zha's parents lie to him, telling him he was born of the Spirit Pearl and is destined to be a great demon hunter. Ne Zha studies under Taiyi and acquires great skills, but is still not allowed to hunt demons. Becoming impatient, he escapes his confines to hunt demons on his own. While chasing a yaksha trying to devour a little girl, Ne Zha burns down a fishing village. Ao Bing joins Ne Zha's fight but is petrified by the yaksha. Ne Zha cleverly defeats the yaksha and rescues both Ao Bing and the little girl, and he and Ao Bing become friends. However, his actions are misunderstood by the townsfolk of the destroyed village. They deem Ne Zha a malicious demon, which causes him to lash out at the villagers, hurting many of them. Ne Zha's parents and Tai Yi arrive to stop him. After Li learns that it was all just a misunderstanding, he plans to prove Ne Zha's innocence on his upcoming birthday party. Ten days later, the Li household organizes a lavish birthday party for their son, inviting the townsfolk to attend. Shen visits Ne Zha before the party and reveals the truth of Ne Zha's nature to him. Furious at his parents' deception, Ne Zha unleashes his true demonic form and nearly kills his father until Ao Bing intervenes. Feeling betrayed, Ne Zha leaves to await his fate. While thanking Ao Bing, Li discovers that he is the reincarnation of the Spirit Pearl. Knowing that if this is revealed, all of dragon kind will be condemned forever, Ao Bing acts on Shen's command. He creates a massive sheet of ice above the town, intending to bury the town and eliminate all witnesses. Meanwhile, Ne Zha learns that when his father visited Heaven to plead for his life, he accepted an enchantment that would allow him to trade his life for Ne Zha's. Moved by his father's sacrifice, Ne Zha returns to the village to stop Ao Bing. Unleashing his full demonic form, Ne Zha defeats Ao Bing, but spares his life for being his only friend. When the heavenly lightning approaches, Ne Zha surrenders to his fate but is unexpectedly joined by Ao Bing. Linking hands, they unleash the Chaos Pearl's ability to absorb energy. Their mortal bodies cannot withstand the full energy of the strike and are destroyed, but with Taiyi's help, they survive as spirits. In the mid-credits scene, the Dragon King vows vengeance on the citizens of Chentang Pass for what happened to Ao Bing. The other three Dragon Kings of the Four Seas appear and use this as an opportunity to make a deal with him. Meanwhile, in an unknown location, a sneak peek of the movie Jiang Ziya is introduced.",

    "plot": "Three years after her adventure with the demigod Maui and the island goddess Te Fiti, Moana spends her days exploring other islands near her home island of Motunui in the hope of finding people connected to the ocean. On her return from one such voyage, Moana is given the title of tautai, or master wayfinder — Motunui's first tautai in a thousand years. In a vision, Moana's ancestor, Tautai Vasa, reveals why none of those people are connected anymore: the malicious storm god Nalo wanted power over the mortals, so he sunk a legendary island called Motufetu, which connected all of the islands, down to the depths of the ocean. Vasa further warns that the people of Motunui will go extinct in the future if Moana cannot find a way to raise Motufetu. In response to this call from the ancestors, Moana assembles a crew of people from Motunui — craftswoman Loto, historian Moni, and grumpy elderly farmer Kele, alongside her pet pig and rooster, Pua and Heihei — to follow the path of a comet across the ocean towards Motufetu. Meanwhile, Maui is seeking Motufetu himself since he had a previous quarrel with Nalo, but he is captured by Nalo's enforcer, Matangi. Maui is reluctant to contact Moana, as he fears she may not survive if she comes to help. Moana and her crew are captured by the Kakamora, a tribe of savage coconut-like pirates that Moana previously encountered, who reveal that Nalo's actions against Motufetu had caused them to be disconnected from their home island. A Kakamora named Kotu helps the crew paralyze a gargantuan monster clam inside of which is Matangi's lair. While the crew finds Maui, Moana meets Matangi and learns that she is not happy serving Nalo. Matangi helps Moana escape and reunite with Maui and her friends, before sending them to where Nalo is. Maui warns that Nalo's realm is deadlier compared to the mortal realm and that fighting him will spell certain death for mere mortals. Nalo's monsters ambush the group, damaging their raft and washing them ashore on an isolated island. Moana begins to despair, but Maui encourages her to keep on going. With Moana revitalized, the group plans to have Maui raise Motufetu so that Moana can touch it, as that is the only way to stop Nalo. Her crew repairs her raft, but when the group ventures forth to confront Nalo, they encounter a gigantic storm. Moana, realizing that Nalo is trying to stop humans from breaking the curse, asks Maui to lift Motufetu enough for her to touch it. Maui begins to pull up Motufetu with his giant hook, but Nalo strips Maui of his demigod powers with a lightning bolt. Moana, in a moment of desperation, dives into the ocean to touch Motufetu underwater, but as she succeeds, Nalo's lightning kills her. Maui jumps in after her body, and with a magical chant, summons the spirits of Tautai Vasa and Moana's ancestors, including her grandmother Tala, who help revive her as a demigoddess, with Moana gaining a wayfinder's tattoo. Maui, also regaining his powers as a demigod, finally raises Motufetu and helps Moana reconnect the people with the ocean. The crew returns home to Motunui, leading a flotilla of the peoples of the ocean, and a celebration is held in Moana's honor. In a mid-credits scene, Nalo plans his revenge and is about to punish Matangi for helping Moana, when the giant crab Tamatoa arrives to join his cause.",

    "title": "Inside Out 2",
    "plot": "Two years after her move to San Francisco, 13-year-old Riley Andersen is entering high school. Her personified emotions—Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger—now oversee a newly formed element of Riley's mind called her \"Sense of Self\", which houses memories and feelings that shape Riley's beliefs. Joy, aiming to fill the Sense of Self with only good memories, has created a spring-loaded mechanism that launches bad memories to the back of Riley's mind. Riley and her best friends, Bree and Grace, are invited to a three-day ice hockey camp, where Riley hopes to qualify for her new school's team, the Fire Hawks. In Headquarters, a \"puberty alarm\" from the previous movie goes off the night before camp, and several mind workers abruptly upgrade the emotion console, whilst leaving Headquarters in disarray. The emotions find that Riley now overreacts to any inputs they make to the console. Four new emotions—Anxiety, Envy, Embarrassment, and Ennui—arrive and clash with the original emotions over their approaches. In particular, Joy wants Riley to have fun at camp, while Anxiety focuses on winning a spot on the team and making new friends, especially that Bree and Grace will be attending a different high school. Under Joy's control, Riley inadvertently gets the campers in trouble by the strict camp director, Coach Roberts. Anxiety, deciding that Riley needs to change to fit in with the older players, launches the Sense of Self to the back of the mind and has the old emotions bottled up and thrown into a memory vault. The new emotions then create a new anxiety-dominated Sense of Self and encourage Riley to befriend popular hockey player Valentina \"Val\" Ortiz, straining her friendship with Bree and Grace. After the original emotions escape the vault, Joy sends Sadness back to Headquarters with a two-way radio while she and the others retrieve the Sense of Self. Sadness is discovered by Embarrassment, who decides to help her remain hidden. Under Anxiety's control, Riley sneaks into Coach Roberts' office and learns from her notebook that Riley is not considered ready yet to become a Fire Hawk. The four original emotions find the old Sense of Self on a mountain of bad memories deposited by Joy's mechanism. Anxiety, overhearing Joy's plan through the two-way radio, destroys the recall tube, stranding Joy and the other emotions in the back of Riley's mind. Joy breaks down as she cannot find out how to save Riley, who has grown into a self-conscious, self-hating individual. The emotions use dynamite to blow up the cliff supporting the bad memories, sending them careening into the belief pool. They ride the flood of memories to return to Headquarters. Anxiety realizes her plan to create a new Sense of Self has backfired, having generated one of self-doubt and inferiority, which causes Riley to perform poorly during her final tryout match, accidentally crash into Grace, and get sent to the penalty box. Horrified, Anxiety tries to help Riley but frantically swarms the console in a blinding whirlwind, causing Riley to have an anxiety attack. Returning to Headquarters, Joy finds Anxiety still in control but paralyzed and heavily distressed; Joy convinces her that Riley doesn't need to change to have a better future. Anxiety relents and Joy reinstates Riley's original Sense of Self, but the panic attack persists. Anxiety apologizes to Joy, admitting that neither she, nor any of the emotions, gets to choose who Riley is. Joy, realizing that Anxiety is telling the truth, removes the first Sense of Self, allowing a new one to form from both Riley's good and bad memories. The emotions embrace this third self, calming Riley and helping her reconcile with Bree and Grace. The console calls for Joy, who reassumes command and helps Riley happily finish the hockey tryouts. Riley befriends Val and the other Fire Hawks at high school, while maintaining her friendship with Bree and Grace. Living in peace, the nine emotions work together to protect Riley, as she happily checks her phone for the Fire Hawks' recruitment results.",

    "title": "Coco",
    "plot": "In the Mexican town of Santa Cecilia, a young woman named Imelda marries a man who eventually leaves her and their daughter Coco to pursue a music career. When he never returns, Imelda bans music from her family and opens a shoemaking business. Decades later, Imelda's great-great-grandson Miguel lives in the family home with his parents and relatives, including an elderly and ailing Coco. Despite the family's continued ban on music, Miguel secretly loves it and teaches himself to play guitar by watching videos of his idol, the late musician Ernesto de la Cruz. On the Day of the Dead, Miguel inadvertently bumps the family ofrenda and breaks a frame containing a photo of Imelda and an infant Coco. He discovers a hidden section of the photograph that shows his great-great-grandfather (whose head has been torn from the photo) holding Ernesto's famous guitar. Believing this proves Ernesto is his relative, Miguel excitedly tells his family about his musical aspirations. In response, Miguel's grandmother destroys his guitar, causing him to shun his family. Distraught, Miguel breaks into Ernesto's mausoleum and takes his guitar to use in a local talent competition. Once Miguel strums it, he becomes invisible to all living people. However, he can interact with his skeletal dead relatives, who are visiting from the Land of the Dead for the holiday. Taking him back with them, they realize Imelda cannot visit since Miguel removed her photo from the ofrenda. Miguel also discovers that he has been cursed for stealing from the dead: he must receive a family blessing to return to the living world before sunrise or he will remain in the Land of the Dead forever. Imelda offers him a blessing on the condition that he abandons music, but Miguel refuses and seeks Ernesto's blessing instead. Miguel encounters Héctor, a down-on-his-luck skeleton who once performed with Ernesto. Héctor offers to bring Miguel to Ernesto in exchange for Miguel placing his photo on an ofrenda so he can visit his daughter before she forgets him, which would cause him to fade from existence. Héctor helps Miguel perform in a talent competition to win entry to Ernesto's mansion, but Miguel flees after being discovered by his family. Miguel sneaks into Ernesto's mansion and is welcomed by a surprised Ernesto, but Héctor appears and accuses Ernesto of stealing his songs. As the two argue, Miguel slowly pieces together the truth: Ernesto and Héctor were once a musical act on the brink of fame until Héctor grew homesick and tried to leave. Unable to write songs himself, Ernesto poisoned Héctor and stole his guitar and songs to pass off as his own. To protect his legacy, Ernesto seizes Héctor's photo and has Miguel and Héctor thrown into a cenote pit. There, Héctor reveals that his daughter is named Coco, thus making him Miguel’s actual great-great-grandfather. After being rescued by his family, Miguel reveals the truth about Héctor's death, and Imelda and Héctor reconcile. The family infiltrates Ernesto's concert to retrieve Héctor's photo. Ernesto's crimes are exposed to the audience, who quickly turn on him, and he is crushed by a falling bell (mirroring his fate in real life), although Héctor's photograph is lost in the chaos. As the sun rises, Imelda and a fading Héctor bless Miguel and return him to the living world. Back home, Miguel apologizes to his family for running away and plays \"Remember Me\" on Héctor's guitar, brightening Coco to sing with him. She shares that she kept the torn piece of the photo with Héctor's face, then tells her family stories about her father, preserving his memory and existence in the Land of the Dead. Miguel reconciles with his family and their ban on music is finally lifted. One year later, Miguel shows his new baby sister the family ofrenda, now displaying photos of Héctor and a recently deceased Coco, while Coco's collected letters from Héctor prove Ernesto's theft of his songs, leading to Ernesto's disgrace and Héctor's rightful recognition. In the Land of the Dead, Héctor joins Imelda, Coco, and their family to visit the living world. Miguel performs a heartfelt song for his living and dead relatives.",

    "title": "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe",
    "plot": "In September 1940, after surviving The Blitz during World War II, the Pevensie children – Lucy, Edmund, Peter, and Susan – are evacuated from London, England to the country home of Professor Kirke. During a game of hide-and-seek, Lucy discovers a wardrobe and hides inside, only to find that she has entered a magical winter world. She encounters a faun named Mr. Tumnus, who tells her she is in Narnia. Tumnus lulls Lucy to sleep by playing a flute lullaby. When she wakes up, he explains that he had intended to betray her to the White Witch, who has cursed Narnia to an eternal winter and never Christmas; any humans encountered are to be brought to her. Instead, Tumnus sends Lucy back home through the wardrobe, where she finds that hardly any time has passed in the real world. Lucy later goes back through the wardrobe. Edmund follows her but encounters the White Witch, who claims to be the Queen of Narnia, and her servant, Ginarrbrik, and tells her about Tumnus. The Witch offers him Turkish delight and kingship if he brings his siblings to her. In the real world, Lucy shares with Peter and Susan about Narnia, but Edmund spitefully betrays her by pretending Lucy only imagined it. Professor Kirke, however, suggests Lucy is telling the truth. After accidentally breaking a window, the siblings flee the housekeeper through the wardrobe and enter Narnia. Peter chastises Edmund for lying about Lucy and forces him to apologize to her. They discover that the Witch has taken Tumnus as Edmunnd unintentionally turned him in to her. They meet talking beavers, who say Aslan plans to return and regain control of Narnia, and that there is a prophecy that when two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve sit on the thrones of Cair Paravel, the Witch's reign will end. Edmund sneaks off to visit the Witch, but she is furious that he came without his siblings. She sends wolves led by Maugrim to find the children, and Edmund is imprisoned, where he meets Tumnus. The children and beavers escape, and the Witch turns Tumnus to stone. Peter, Lucy, Susan, and the beavers encounter Father Christmas, a sign that the Witch's power is weakening. He gives them tools to defend themselves — Lucy receives a dagger and a cordial that can heal any injury; Susan a magical horn and a bow with a quiver of arrows; and Peter a sword and shield. After evading the Witch's wolves, the group reaches Aslan's camp, where he is revealed to be a lion. Maugrim and a wolf ambush Lucy and Susan, but Peter kills Maugrim. Aslan's troops chase the fleeing wolf scout and rescue Edmund. The Witch journeys to Aslan's camp to claim Edmund as a traitor due to a blood contract law, but Aslan secretly offers himself instead. That night, Lucy and Susan witness the Witch kill Aslan at the Stone Table and deploy an army to prepare for war. Aslan is resurrected, citing magic beyond the Witch's understanding, and takes Susan and Lucy to the Witch's castle to free the petrified prisoners. Upon learning of Aslan's death, Edmund urges Peter to lead. Both armies clash, with the Witch's army nearly overwhelming Peter and Edmund's. Edmund is mortally wounded after breaking the Witch's wand while saving Peter. Aslan arrives with reinforcements, and he kills the Witch. Susan kills Ginarrbrik, and Lucy heals Edmund with her cordial. The Pevensies are crowned King Peter the Magnificent, Queen Susan the Gentle, King Edmund the Just, and Queen Lucy the Valiant. Fifteen years later, the siblings, now adults, pursue a white stag. They find the lamppost Lucy first encountered in Narnia. They cross back through the wardrobe, becoming children again since little time has passed. Professor Kirke asks why they were in the wardrobe. Peter says he wouldn't believe them, and he responds, \"Try me.\" In a mid-credit scene, Lucy attempts to use the wardrobe again, but Professor Kirke tells her he has also tried, and they will probably return to Narnia when they least expect it.",

    "plot": "A group of sentient toys, who pretend to be lifeless when humans are around, are preparing to move into a new house with their young owner Andy Davis, his infant sister Molly, and their single mother Mrs. Davis. Learning that Andy's birthday party has been unexpectedly moved to an earlier date, several toys — including Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, Rex the tyrannosaur, Hamm the piggy bank, and Bo Peep the porcelain doll — become concerned that Andy might receive something that will replace them. To calm them, Sheriff Woody, Andy's favorite toy and their de facto leader, sends Sarge and his green army men to spy on Andy's birthday party with a baby monitor. Andy receives a Buzz Lightyear action figure, who believes he is an actual Space Ranger and does not know he is really a toy. Buzz impresses the others with his high-tech features and becomes Andy's new favorite toy, provoking Woody's jealousy. Two days before the move, Andy's family plans for a dinner at Pizza Planet. To ensure Andy brings him along and not Buzz, Woody tries knocking Buzz behind the desk with RC, the radio-controlled car. However, Buzz is accidentally knocked out of the bedroom window instead, and most of the other toys believe Woody has deliberately killed Buzz. Andy takes Woody with him, but Buzz furiously confronts him in the car. The two fight, fall out of the car, and are left behind; after a further quarrel, they hitch a ride to the restaurant on a Pizza Planet delivery truck. At Pizza Planet, Buzz mistakes a claw crane full of toy aliens for a rocket, and climbs in, pursued by Woody. Sid Phillips, Andy's sadistic next-door neighbor, takes the two from the crane to his house, where they encounter his Bull Terrier Scud and his \"mutant\" toys, made from parts of other toys Sid has destroyed. Buzz witnesses a television commercial promoting him and suffers an existential crisis, realizing he is a toy after all. He attempts to fly but falls and severs his arm. After Sid's toys fix Buzz, Sid tapes Buzz to a firework rocket, planning to blow him up the following day. Overnight, Woody helps Buzz realize that his purpose is to make Andy happy, restoring Buzz's resolve. Sid takes Buzz out to blow him up, but Woody rallies the mutant toys to come to life in front of Sid and frighten him into never harming toys again. Now freed, Woody and Buzz pursue the Davis' moving truck, but Scud attacks Woody. Buzz stays behind to fight off the dog; Woody climbs into the truck, and pushes RC out to rescue Buzz. Thinking Woody has killed another toy, the others also toss him out of the truck. When Woody and Buzz pursue the truck on RC, the other toys see them and realize their mistake. RC's batteries run out, forcing Woody to ignite the rocket strapped to Buzz. As the two are propelled into the air, Buzz opens his wings to sever the tape just before the rocket explodes; he and Woody glide through the sunroof of Mrs. Davis' car, landing safely inside. As the toys listen in on the Christmas gift opening in the new house, Mr. Potato Head is delighted when Molly gets a Mrs. Potato Head. Woody and Buzz jokingly ponder what gift could be \"worse\" than Buzz, only to nervously smile at each other when Andy gets a dachshund puppy.",

    "plot": "In 1985, teenager Marty McFly lives in Hill Valley, California, with his depressed alcoholic mother, Lorraine; his older siblings, who are professional and social failures; and his meek father, George, who is bullied by his supervisor, Biff Tannen. After Marty's band fails a music audition, he confides in his girlfriend, Jennifer Parker, that he fears becoming like his parents despite his ambitions. That night, Marty meets his eccentric scientist friend, Emmett \"Doc\" Brown, in the Twin Pines mall parking lot. Doc unveils a time machine built from a modified DeLorean, powered by plutonium he swindled from Libyan terrorists. After Doc inputs a destination time of November 5, 1955 (the day he conceived his time travel invention), the terrorists arrive unexpectedly and gun him down. Marty flees in the DeLorean, inadvertently activating time travel when reaching 88 miles per hour (142 kilometers per hour). Arriving in 1955, Marty discovers he has no plutonium, so he cannot return to 1985. While exploring a burgeoning Hill Valley, Marty encounters his teenage father, discovering Biff was bullying George even then. George falls into the path of an oncoming car while spying on the teenage Lorraine changing clothes, and Marty is knocked unconscious while saving him. He wakes to find himself tended to by Lorraine, who becomes infatuated with him. Marty tracks down and convinces a younger Doc that he is from the future. Doc explains the only source available in 1955 capable of generating the 1.21 gigawatts of power required for time travel is a lightning bolt. Marty shows Doc a flyer from the future that documents an upcoming lightning strike at the town's courthouse. As Marty's siblings begin to fade from a photo he carries with him, Doc realizes Marty's actions are altering the future and jeopardizing his existence: Lorraine was supposed to tend to George instead of Marty after the car accident. Early attempts to get his parents acquainted fail, and Lorraine's infatuation with Marty deepens. Lorraine asks Marty to the school dance, and he plots to feign inappropriate advances on her, allowing George to intervene and rescue her, but the plan goes awry when Biff's gang locks Marty in the trunk of the performing band's car, while Biff forces himself onto Lorraine. George arrives expecting to find Marty but is assaulted by Biff. After Biff hurts Lorraine, an enraged George knocks him unconscious and escorts the grateful Lorraine to the dance. The band frees Marty from their car, but the lead guitarist injures his hand in the process, so Marty takes his place, performing while George and Lorraine share their first kiss. With his future no longer in jeopardy, Marty hurries to the courthouse to meet Doc. Doc discovers a letter from Marty warning him about his future and rips it up, worried about the consequences. To save Doc, Marty recalibrates the DeLorean to return ten minutes before he had left the future. The lightning strikes, sending Marty back to 1985, but the DeLorean breaks down, forcing Marty to run back to the mall. He arrives as Doc is being shot. While Marty grieves at his side, Doc sits up, revealing he had pieced Marty's note back together and is wearing a bulletproof vest. He takes Marty home and departs to 2015 in the DeLorean. Marty wakes the next morning, discovering his father is now a confident and successful science fiction author, his mother is fit and happy, his siblings are successful, and Biff is a servile valet in George's employ. As Marty reunites with Jennifer, Doc suddenly reappears in the DeLorean, insisting they return with him to the future to save their children from terrible fates.",

    "plot": "While Harry Potter spends the summer with the Dursleys, Dobby, a house-elf, attempts to prevent him returning to Hogwarts by sabotaging an important dinner with Vernon Dursley's boss. Vernon attempts to prevent his departure in retaliation, but his friend Ron Weasley and his brothers Fred and George rescue him in their father's flying car. Harry meets up with Hermione Granger in Diagon Alley, where they meet Hogwarts' new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Gilderoy Lockhart, along with Draco Malfoy and his father, Lucius, who Harry sees slip a book into Ginny Weasley's cauldron. After being blocked from entering Platform Nine and Three-Quarters at King's Cross railway station, Harry and Ron fly the car to Hogwarts, where they crash into the Whomping Willow. Ron's wand is broken and they each receive detention, during which Harry hears a strange voice and subsequently finds caretaker Argus Filch's cat, Mrs Norris, petrified with a message written in blood: \"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened, enemies of the heir... beware.\" One of Hogwarts' founders, Salazar Slytherin, supposedly constructed a secret Chamber containing a monster that only his heir can control, capable of purging the school of Muggle-borns. Suspecting Malfoy to be the heir, Harry, Ron, and Hermione plan to question him, using polyjuice potion, which they brew in a bathroom haunted by the ghost Moaning Myrtle. Harry's arm is broken by a rogue Bludger in a Quidditch match; while recovering, Dobby visits him and reveals he closed the barrier and made the rogue Bludger to force him to leave the school, in addition to the Chamber having been opened in the past. After students are found petrified, Harry is suspected of being the heir of Slytherin after communicating with a snake - an ability shared with Slytherin. Disguised as Crabbe and Goyle, Harry and Ron learn Malfoy is not the heir, but that a Muggle-born girl died when the Chamber was last opened. Harry finds an enchanted diary owned by a former student Tom Marvolo Riddle, who blames a young Rubeus Hagrid for opening the Chamber, leading to his expulsion. When Hermione is petrified, Harry and Ron question Hagrid, who is sent to Azkaban by Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge, while Lucius forces the school governors to remove Dumbledore from office. Hagrid discreetly tells the boys to \"follow the spiders\"; they venture into the Forbidden Forest and meet Hagrid's spider, Aragog, who reveals Hagrid's innocence and provides another clue of the Chamber's monster. A book page in Hermione's hand identifies the monster as a basilisk, a giant serpent that kills people who make direct eye contact; the petrified victims only saw it indirectly. Ginny is taken into the Chamber and the teachers nominate Lockhart to save her; Harry and Ron find Lockhart preparing to flee and expose him as a fraud. Deducing that Myrtle was the Muggle-born girl that the basilisk killed, they find the Chamber's entrance in the bathroom she haunts. Once inside, Lockhart tries to erase Harry and Ron's memories and take the credit, however, his spell backfires when he uses Ron's broken wand, erasing his memory and causing a cave-in, separating Harry from Ron and Lockhart. Harry enters the Chamber alone and finds Ginny unconscious and Riddle - Slytherin's heir and Voldemort's younger self - who reveals he used the diary to manipulate Ginny into reopening the Chamber. Harry expresses his loyalty to Dumbledore, whose pet phoenix Fawkes arrives with the Sorting Hat. Riddle summons the basilisk, who Fawkes blinds, and the Sorting Hat produces the Sword of Gryffindor, which Harry uses to kill the basilisk after a battle, but is poisoned by one of its fangs. Despite being injured, Harry stabs the diary with the basilisk fang, destroying Riddle and reviving Ginny. Harry is healed by Fawkes' tears, and returns to Hogwarts with his friends and a baffled Lockhart. Harry learns that Dobby's master is Lucius, who he accuses of planting the diary in Ginny's cauldron and tricks him into freeing Dobby. Dumbledore is reinstated as headmaster, the basilisk's victims are healed, Hermione reunites with her friends, and Hagrid is released from Azkaban.",

    "plot": "Shrek is an anti-social ogre who loves the solitude of his swamp and enjoys fending off mobs and intruders. One day, his life is interrupted after he inadvertently saves a talkative Donkey from some soldiers, prompting Donkey to forcibly stay with him. Donkey is one of many fairytale creatures that are being exiled or sold by the dwarfish Lord Farquaad of Duloc to beautify his land. However, the creatures inadvertently end up in the swamp. Angered by the intrusion, Shrek resolves to visit Farquaad and demand that he moves the creatures elsewhere, reluctantly allowing Donkey to accompany him as he is the only one who knows where Duloc is. Meanwhile, Farquaad is presented with the Magic Mirror, who tells him that he must marry a princess in order to become king. Farquaad randomly chooses Princess Fiona, who is imprisoned in a castle guarded by a Dragon. Unwilling to rescue Fiona himself, he organizes a tournament in which the winner will receive the \"privilege\" of performing the task on his behalf. When Shrek and Donkey arrive at Duloc, Farquaad announces that whoever kills Shrek will win the tournament; however, Shrek and Donkey defeat Farquaad's knights with relative ease. Amused, Farquaad proclaims them champions, and agrees to relocate the fairytale creatures if Shrek rescues Fiona. Shrek and Donkey travel to the castle and the Dragon attacks them. Shrek locates Fiona, who is appalled by his lack of romanticism; they flee the castle after rescuing Donkey from the Dragon, who is revealed to be female and has fallen in love with him. When Shrek removes his helmet and reveals he is an ogre, Fiona stubbornly refuses to go to Duloc, demanding Farquaad arrive in person to save her, but Shrek carries Fiona against her will. That night, after setting up camp, and with Fiona alone in a cave, Shrek admits to Donkey that he is anti-social because he grew frustrated over being constantly judged for his appearance. Fiona overhears this and becomes kinder to Shrek. The next day, Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men harass the three, but Fiona easily defeats them in physical combat. Shrek becomes impressed with Fiona, and they begin to fall in love. When the trio nears Duloc, Fiona takes shelter in a windmill for the evening. Donkey enters alone and discovers that Fiona has transformed into an ogress. She explains that during her childhood, she was cursed to transform into an ogress at night but retain her human form during the day. She tells Donkey that only \"true love's kiss\" will break the spell and change her to \"love's true form\". Meanwhile, Shrek is about to confess his feelings to Fiona, when he overhears Fiona referring to herself as an \"ugly beast\". Believing that she is talking about him, Shrek angrily leaves and returns the next morning with Farquaad. Confused and hurt by Shrek's abrupt hostility, Fiona reluctantly accepts Farquaad's marriage proposal and requests that they be married that day before sunset. Shrek dismisses Donkey and returns to his now vacated swamp, but quickly realizes that he feels miserable without Fiona. Donkey lectures Shrek for jumping to conclusions and reveals that Fiona was not referring to him as an \"ugly beast\", although Donkey does not reveal Fiona's secret to Shrek. The two reconcile, and Donkey summons the Dragon, whom he had reunited with earlier in the day. Shrek and Donkey ride Dragon to Duloc so they can stop the wedding. Shrek interrupts the ceremony just before it ends and expresses his feelings for Fiona. The sun sets, and Fiona transforms into an ogress in front of everyone. Disgusted and enraged, Farquaad orders Shrek to be executed and Fiona re-imprisoned, so that he will still be king by technicality. The two are saved when the Dragon, ridden by Donkey, breaks in and devours Farquaad. Shrek and Fiona kiss, and Fiona's curse is broken; though she remains an ogress, Shrek reassures her that he still finds her beautiful. They marry in the swamp with the fairy tale creatures in attendance, then leave for their honeymoon.",

Expecting to be expelled from Hogwarts for using magic outside school, Harry runs away, but gets emergency transport from The Knight Bus to the Leaky Cauldron, where the Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge assures Harry that he will not face punishment. Upon reuniting with his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, Harry learns that Sirius Black, an alleged supporter of Lord Voldemort, has escaped Azkaban Prison with intent to kill him. While journeying to Hogwarts, the Hogwarts Express is boarded by Dementors, ghostly prison guards searching for Black; one of them causes Harry to faint, but new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Remus Lupin, repels it using a Patronus Charm. At Hogwarts, Headmaster Albus Dumbledore announces that Dementors will patrol the school until Black is captured. Hagrid is appointed as the Care of Magical Creatures teacher, but his first class goes awry when Draco Malfoy provokes a hippogriff named Buckbeak to attack him; as a result, Draco's father has Buckbeak sentenced to death. Hogwarts is put on high alert when the portrait of The Fat Lady warns that Sirius Black is in the castle and attempted to break into Gryffindor Tower. The Dementors attack Harry during a Quidditch match, but he is saved by Dumbledore while his broomstick is destroyed, leading Harry to ask Lupin to teach him the Patronus Charm. Unable to visit Hogsmeade Village without permission from his guardians, Harry attempts to sneak out of the castle, when Fred and George Weasley provide him with the Marauder's Map, which shows him a secure passage to Hogsmeade. While there, he overhears from Professor Minerva McGonagall, Madam Rosmerta, and Minister Fudge that Black is actually his godfather, divulged the Potters' whereabouts to Lord Voldemort and murdered their mutual friend, Peter Pettigrew. Harry, Ron and Hermione witness the execution of Buckbeak, after which Ron is dragged by a large black dog into a hole at the base of the Whomping Willow. Harry and Hermione follow him through an underground passage into the Shrieking Shack, where the dog is revealed to be Black, an Animagus. Lupin appears in the shack, where he is revealed to be an old friend of Black and a werewolf. Lupin and Black reveal that Ron's pet rat Scabbers is actually the Animagus form of Pettigrew, who is returned to human form and confesses to betraying Harry's parents, framing Black and faking his death. The group heads back to the castle, intending to both expose Pettigrew and exonerate Sirius, but the full moon causes Lupin to transform into a werewolf and Pettigrew escapes. Black transforms into his animal form and fights off werewolf Lupin, who seriously injures Black. Harry finds Black and they both are attacked by Dementors until an unseen person casts a powerful Patronus charm to ward them off. Harry falls unconscious and awakens in the infirmary, where Hermione tells him Black is sentenced to the Dementor's Kiss. Harry and Hermione use Hermione's Time-Turner to go back three hours, where they first rescue Buckbeak from execution, and Harry realizes he was the one who saved himself and Black with a Patronus charm, and uses it to drive the Dementors away. They successfully free Black, who escapes with Buckbeak. Subsequently, Lupin resigns, having been exposed as a werewolf, and Harry receives a new Firebolt broomstick from Black.",

    "title": "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire",
    "plot": "Harry Potter has a nightmare in which a Muggle caretaker named Frank Bryce is murdered at the Riddle House after overhearing a plot by Lord Voldemort, Peter Pettigrew and another man whom Harry does not recognise. The following morning, Harry attends the Quidditch World Cup with the Weasleys, Hermione Granger, Cedric Diggory and his father Amos. That night, Death Eaters attack the campsite after the tournament and the unknown man from Harry's nightmare casts the Dark Mark. At Hogwarts, Professor Dumbledore announces that the school will host the Triwizard Tournament along with the Durmstrang Institute and the Beauxbatons Academy. One student from each school will be chosen by the Goblet of Fire to participate; students under the age of seventeen are ineligible. The Goblet selects Fleur Delacour for Beauxbatons, Viktor Krum for Durmstrang, and Cedric for Hogwarts. It then chooses Harry as a fourth Champion, leading to much confusion. Many students believe Harry cheated, and Ron distances himself from him, hurt that Harry did not tell him when he allegedly entered. Harry is forced to compete due to a magical binding contract when a Champion's name was selected. For the first task, the Champions must retrieve an egg by getting past a dragon. Professor Alastor Moody, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, hints that Harry can use his wand to summon his broomstick. All four Champions collect their eggs. Ron reconciles with Harry after witnessing how perilous the first task was. On Christmas Eve, the school hosts the Yule Ball, but Harry and Ron could not attend with their preferred dates and instead go with Parvati and Padma Patil, respectively; Hermione goes with Viktor, provoking Ron's jealousy. Cedric advises Harry to use the Prefects' bathroom on the fifth floor of Hogwarts, take a bath, and submerge the egg in the water to find the second clue. For the second task, the Champions must rescue somebody of value to them from the Black Lake: Harry has to save Ron, Cedric has to save his girlfriend Cho Chang (whom Harry asked to the Ball), Viktor has to rescue Hermione, and Fleur has to save her sister Gabrielle. Neville Longbottom gives Harry gillyweed to help him breathe underwater. Cedric comes in first, and Harry is awarded second place after he saves not only Ron but also Gabrielle after Fleur had withdrawn from the task. Harry later finds the lifeless body of Barty Crouch Sr., a Ministry of Magic official, in the Forbidden Forest. In Dumbledore's office, he enters a Pensieve. He witnesses the questioning of Igor Karkaroff, current headmaster of Durmstrang, by Barty Crouch Sr. Karkaroff is asked to name those who served Voldemort. He names Severus Snape, but Dumbledore vouches for Snape. Karkaroff then names Barty Crouch Jr. Harry recognises Crouch Jr. from his nightmare. For the third task, the Champions must navigate a maze to reach the Triwizard Cup. Harry and Cedric reach the Cup only to discover it is a Portkey that transports them to a graveyard from Harry's dream. Pettigrew kills Cedric on Voldemort's orders. He then uses Harry's blood to resurrect Voldemort, who summons his Death Eaters before torturing Harry. Voldemort attempts to use the Killing Curse on Harry but the latter deflects it. The ghosts of Voldemort's previous victims: Frank, Cedric, and Harry's parents Lily and James appear, distracting Voldemort long enough for Harry to use the Cup to return to Hogwarts with Cedric's body. Harry informs Dumbledore of Cedric's murder and Voldemort's return. Harry is escorted by Moody to his office where he learns that Moody put his name into the Goblet and was guiding him to ensure the return of Voldemort. Just as Moody is about to kill Harry, Dumbledore, Snape and Minerva McGonagall subdue Moody. Using Veritaserum, they learn that they have caught Barty Crouch Jr. who was impersonating Moody using Polyjuice Potion; the real Moody is imprisoned in a magical trunk. At a memorial ceremony, Dumbledore announces that Voldemort murdered Cedric, although the Ministry denies these claims. Harry informs Dumbledore of his encounter with Voldemort, which Dumbledore describes as Priori Incantatem. The three schools bid farewell, with Harry, Ron, and Hermione agreeing that everything will change.",

    "plot": "Gabby, Pandy Paws, her Gabby cats, and her dollhouse go on a road trip with her grandmother Gigi to visit her home for a special project. In Cat Francisco, CatRat accidentally unlatches the dollhouse from the van, causing it to roll into a store where Vera, a cat lady, buys it and drives home. Vera then splits the Gabby cats up. CatRat finds a plush cat named Chumsley in a drawer. Gabby, determined to save her dollhouse, shrinks along with Pandy and is taken to Vera's home, where the dollhouse is. Gabby learns the Gabby cats are missing but meets Chumsley at Cakey's kitchen, while ordering CatRat to stay. Chumsley offers to help. Gabby and Pandy find MerCat in Vera's aquarium and jump in, turning into mermaids. They free MerCat, traveling in a bubble, and find the Gabby cats in a bag. Vera opens the door, causing them to fly outside and fall into a bush. They meet kitty gnomes who take them to the Kitty Fairy, their queen. At the kitty gnomes' hideout, they trick the gnomes into playing hide and seek while building a bird-like vehicle to escape. The Kitty Fairy gives up her queen title and returns to the dollhouse with MerCat. Meanwhile, Gabby and Pandy try to free the Gabby cats as Vera is distracted by Kitty Rangers. Gabby rescues the cats and they return to the dollhouse, where Chumsley shares how Vera once played with him but grew up and left him in her drawer. Gabby, Pandy, and the Gabby cats are cast out, and Chumsley seals the windows, claiming ownership of the dollhouse. Pandy goes to get Gigi. CatRat unlocks the door and the team enters the dollhouse to stop Chumsley. Gabby nearly pinches her cat ears, but Chumsley steals them, corrupting the dollhouse. Gabby tearfully tells Baby Box she's scared of growing up, and Baby Box comforts her, giving her back her cat ears. Carlita returns with a smaller Gigi. Gabby reunites with Gigi and shares what happened. Chumsley makes a cake with all ingredients, accidentally creating a portal. Gabby becomes big again to stop Vera, then they both turn small and meet Gigi and the Gabby cats. They find the portal in Cakey's kitchen, which sucks Gabby, Vera, Cakey, and Chumsley into a world of sweets. Gabby, Vera, and Cakey see Chumsley's paw prints and ride animal-shaped cookies to catch up. Gummy worms erupt from the candy grounds, carrying them away, and Chumsley escapes. The ground collapses, and they fall into a river, floating on a donut. As Vera talks about growing up, Cookie Bobby, a friendly cookie monster, throws them to safety, while Chumsley crosses a sweets-made rickety bridge. Before Vera can reconcile with Chumsley, he destroys the bridge. The magic from the dollhouse begins to fade, causing the world to start collapsing. Vera and Chumsley save each other and reconcile, while everyone manages to return to the dollhouse. Its magic is restored, and a balloon shaped like a cat inflates from the dollhouse, lifting it as it flies over Cat Francisco. Back at Gigi's home, Gabby helps build the special project Gigi has been working on: a dog-themed dollhouse for Gabby's sister.",

    "title": "Howl's Moving Castle",
    "plot": "Sophie, a young milliner and eldest of three sisters, encounters a wizard named Howl on her way to visit her sister Lettie. Upon returning home, she meets the Witch of the Waste, who transforms her into a 90-year-old woman. Seeking to break the curse, Sophie leaves home and sets off through the countryside. She meets a living scarecrow, whom she calls \"Turnip Head\". He leads her to Howl's moving castle, which she enters without invitation. She subsequently meets Howl's young apprentice Markl and a fire demon named Calcifer, the source of the castle's magic and movement. Calcifer makes a deal with Sophie, agreeing to break her curse if she breaks his link with Howl. When Howl appears, Sophie announces that she has \"hired herself\" as a cleaning lady. Meanwhile, Sophie's nation is caught up in a war with a neighboring kingdom, which is searching for its missing prince. The King summons Howl to fight in the war. However, Howl decides to send Sophie to the King, under the pretense of being his mother, to tell him that Howl is too much of a coward to fight. Before leaving, he gives Sophie a charmed ring that leads her to Calcifer and guarantees her safety. Sophie meets Suliman, the king's head sorceress, and also the Witch of the Waste, whom Suliman punishes by draining all of her power and reverting her to her true age, thus reducing her into a harmless and very elderly woman. Suliman warns Sophie that Howl will meet the same fate if he does not fight for the King. Howl then arrives to rescue Sophie. Suliman tries to trap him by turning him into a monster, but with Sophie's help, he remembers himself and just barely avoids death. The duo escapes along with the Witch of the Waste and Suliman's dog Heen. Soldiers break into the homes of both Jenkins and Pendragon (Howl's two aliases), finding them to be nothing more than abandoned buildings in disguise; the castle's magical door had allowed travel through both false shopfronts. Sophie learns that Howl's life is somehow bound to Calcifer's and that Howl has been transforming into a bird-like creature to interfere with both sides in the war, but each transformation makes it more difficult for him to return to human form. Howl then has the castle magically linked to Sophie's home, parking the castle itself on the town's outskirts. A few days later, the town is bombed by enemy aircraft and Suliman's henchmen attack the house and Sophie's hat shop. Howl heads out to protect the group. Sophie then moves everyone out of the house and removes Calcifer from the fireplace, which collapses the castle. The Witch of the Waste realizes that Calcifer has Howl's heart and grabs the fire demon, setting herself on fire. Sophie panics and pours water onto the Witch, which douses Calcifer. The remainder of the castle then splits in two; Sophie falls down a chasm and is separated from the group. Following the charmed ring, Sophie wanders into a scene from the past, where she sees a young Howl catch a falling star – Calcifer – and give him his heart. Sophie calls for them to find her in the future as she is teleported away. She returns to the present, finds Howl, and they reunite with the others. The Witch returns Howl's heart, and Sophie places it back inside Howl, reviving him and freeing Calcifer, though he decides to stay. Sophie's curse is broken, though her hair remains silver. After she kisses Turnip Head on the cheek, he returns to human form, revealing himself to be Justin, the missing prince from the enemy kingdom. He reveals that only his true love's kiss can break his curse. After seeing Sophie's affection lies with Howl, he promptly heads for home to cease the war, but promises he will see them again. Suliman, watching through a crystal globe, also decides to end the war. Sometime later, bombers fly under dark skies over a recovered and green countryside headed to another war, while Sophie, Howl, and the others travel in the opposite direction in a new flying castle. As the castle soars away, Howl and Sophie kiss on the castle's balcony.",

They leave for an oasis for the birth, leaving Timon and Pumbaa to watch Kiara. Rafiki visits and recounts the story of Kiara’s grandfather Mufasa, with Timon and Pumbaa adding color commentary. As a cub, Mufasa lives with his parents, Masego and Afia, who seek the legendary Milele. A flood sweeps him into wetlands where he meets Taka, a royal cub. After surviving an attack by young crocodiles, Mufasa is accepted by Queen Eshe but tested by King Obasi, who races Taka and Mufasa to decide his fate. Taka deliberately loses so Mufasa can stay. The cubs grow close, though Obasi distrusts outsiders. During a hunt, Mufasa kills one of two attacking white lions; the survivor warns Kiros, leader of the outcast Outsiders, who seek revenge for Kiros' son Shaju’s death. Kiros leads an assault on Obasi’s pride, killing Obasi, Eshe, and their lions. Mufasa and Taka flee, jumping into a river. The pair meet Sarabi, her hornbill scout Zazu, and a young Rafiki. Rafiki, guided by visions, leads them toward Milele. The Outsiders catch up to the group, forcing Sarabi to cause an elephant stampede so they can escape. Taka falls for Sarabi but grows jealous when Mufasa saves her during the stampede; out of loyalty, Mufasa credits Taka with her rescue. As they travel through snowy mountains, Sarabi admits she knows Mufasa saved her, and the two fall in love. Envious, Taka allies with Kiros, secretly leading the Outsiders to their group. At Milele, Rafiki identifies Mufasa as his “brother” from prophecy. The Outsiders attack, and Mufasa discovers Taka’s betrayal while battling Kiros. Trapped in a cave, Mufasa is nearly killed until a remorseful Taka intervenes. Kiros slashes Taka’s eye, leaving a scar.

A rockfall allows Mufasa to defeat him, and Taka reluctantly saves Mufasa from drowning. Mufasa becomes King of Milele and reunites with Afia, learning Masego has died. He forgives Taka but disowns his name, prompting him to adopt the name \"Scar.\" Mufasa ascends the newly named Pride Rock and roars to his kingdom.

    "plot": "At Malfoy Manor, Severus Snape meets with Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. He reports that the Order of the Phoenix will move Harry Potter, no longer under his mother's protective spell, to a safe location. Voldemort confiscates Lucius Malfoy's wand; his own is powerless against Harry because it and Harry's wand are \"twins\" by sharing the same phoenix feather core. During the move, Harry and the Order are attacked by Voldemort and the Death Eaters, killing Hedwig and Mad-Eye Moody in the process. During preparations for Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding, the new Minister for Magic Rufus Scrimgeour arrives. He informs Harry, Ron, and Hermione that Albus Dumbledore left each a bequest: Ron a Deluminator, Hermione a copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, and Harry the Golden Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match. Dumbledore also bequeathed the Sword of Gryffindor to Harry, but it has gone missing. News arrives during the wedding that the Ministry has fallen and Scrimgeour is dead. Death Eaters attack, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione escape to Number 12, Grimmauld Place. While there, Ron realises that Sirius' brother, Regulus Black, is the R.A.B. who stole Salazar Slytherin's locket from Voldemort. Local thief Mundungus Fletcher later sold it to Dolores Umbridge. Harry, Ron, and Hermione infiltrate the Ministry and recover the locket, but Death Eaters chase them in a chaotic exit. Hermione disapparates them to a forest. Ron is injured. The trio starts their journey to discover and destroy all of Voldemort's Horcruxes, beginning with the locket. Attempts to destroy the locket fail. Hermione deduces that Gryffindor's sword can destroy Horcruxes because it is impregnated with basilisk venom. Ron, affected by the dark locket, is frustrated with their slow progress and irrationally jealous of Harry and Hermione. He argues with Harry before leaving. When Harry touches the Snitch to his lips, it reveals a cryptic message: \"I open at the close.\" Hermione notices a strange symbol drawn in Beedle the Bard that is identical to one Luna Lovegood's father Xenophilius wears. Harry and Hermione search for the sword in Godric's Hollow and encounter the same strange symbol in a cemetery. Elderly historian Bathilda Bagshot leads them to her cottage, where they find a photo of the young man in Harry's dream who stole a wand from wandmaker Gregorovitch. Bathilda morphs into Voldemort's snake Nagini and attacks Harry. Hermione disapparates them to safety, but her rebounding spell accidentally destroys Harry's wand. Hermione identifies the man in the photo as dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald. That night, a doe patronus leads Harry to a frozen pond where Gryffindor's sword lies on the bottom. Harry dives into the frigid water, but the locket chain around his neck tightens, strangling him. Ron appears, retrieves the sword, and saves Harry. They destroy the locket Horcrux with the sword. Ron explains that the Deluminator led him to their location. Harry, Ron, and Hermione visit Xenophilius and learn from the tale that the symbol represents the Deathly Hallows. Many years before, three brothers each received a prize that evades Death: the Resurrection Stone, the Cloak of Invisibility, and the Elder Wand, the most powerful wand known. Possessing all three makes one the Master of Death. Xenophilius then secretly summons the Death Eaters, hoping to exchange Harry for a kidnapped Luna. The three escape, but Snatchers capture them. During a vision, Harry sees an elderly Grindelwald telling Voldemort that the Elder Wand is buried with Dumbledore. At Malfoy Manor, Bellatrix Lestrange sees a Snatcher with Gryffindor's sword that she believed was in her Gringotts vault. Harry and Ron are locked into the cellar, where they encounter Luna, Ollivander, and Griphook. Upstairs, Bellatrix tortures Hermione. Harry begs for help using a mirror shard in which he believes he glimpsed Dumbledore; Dobby appears in response and helps save everyone while Harry grabs their captured wands from Draco Malfoy. As they disapparate, Bellatrix throws a knife, and Dobby is fatally wounded, dying in Harry's arms. Harry buries him near Bill and Fleur's seaside cottage, an Order safe house.

    "plot": "In the distant future, Duke Leto Atreides is assigned by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV to replace Baron Vladimir Harkonnen as the fiefholder of Arrakis, a harsh desert planet and the sole source of \"spice\", a valuable psychotropic substance that imparts heightened vitality and awareness. Spice is also key to interstellar travel, giving Spacing Guild Navigators the ability to guide starships to traverse space instantaneously and safely. Emperor Shaddam, fearful of Leto's rising power, plots for House Harkonnen to retake Arrakis, secretly aided by his Sardaukar troops, and destroy House Atreides. Leto is suspicious of the Emperor but weighs the risks against the power of controlling Arrakis and making an alliance with its mysterious natives, the Fremen. Leto's concubine, Lady Jessica, is an acolyte of the Bene Gesserit—an exclusive sisterhood whose members possess advanced physical and mental abilities. As part of a centuries-long breeding program, they instructed her to bear a daughter whose son would become the Kwisatz Haderach—a Bene Gesserit and messianic superbeing with the prescience necessary to guide humanity to a better future. Jessica disobeyed and bore a son, Paul, who is trained by Leto's aides, Duncan Idaho, Gurney Halleck, the Suk doctor Wellington Yueh, and the Mentat Thufir Hawat, and she teaches him Bene Gesserit disciplines. Paul confides in Jessica and Duncan about troubling visions of the future. The Reverend Mother and Imperial Truthsayer Gaius Helen Mohiam subjects Paul to a deadly gom jabbar test to assess his humanity and impulse control, which he passes. House Atreides arrives at Arrakeen, the principal stronghold on Arrakis. Duncan's advance party has made contact with the Fremen. The natives revere Paul and Jessica, which she explains is due to the Bene Gesserit sowing beliefs on Arrakis centuries earlier. An attempt to assassinate Paul with a hunter-seeker fails. At a secret meeting on the Harkonnen planet Giedi Prime, Mohiam insists Baron Harkonnen spare Paul and Jessica in his coup, to which he duplicitously agrees. Leto meets and negotiates with Fremen chieftain Stilgar and meets the Imperial Judge of the Change, Dr. Liet Kynes, a planetologist who lives among the Fremen. Kynes briefs them on the dangers of spice harvesting, and the giant sandworms that travel under the desert and render unwise the use of protective shields. During a flight, they rescue a stranded spice-harvesting crew from a sandworm, and Paul's exposure to the spice triggers intense premonitions. Yueh betrays the Atreides and disables Arrakeen's shields, allowing the Harkonnens and Sardaukar to invade. He incapacitates Leto, planning to exchange him for his wife, the Baron's prisoner. Yueh replaces one of Leto's teeth with a poison gas capsule with which the Duke can assassinate the Baron. After the Baron double-crosses and murders Yueh, Leto releases the gas, killing himself and the Baron's Mentat, Piter De Vries, but the Baron survives. Though the Baron has arranged to have Paul and Jessica dropped deep in the desert to die, a compassionate Yueh has left them with a fremkit with survival supplies. Jessica uses a Bene Gesserit technique called \"the Voice\" to overpower and kill their captors. Overnighting in the desert, Paul—surrounded by spice—has visions of a bloody holy war fought across the universe in his name. After conquering Arrakis, Baron Harkonnen appoints his nephew Rabban to oversee the planet, and orders him to restart spice production to recoup the invasion's cost. Meanwhile, Duncan and Kynes find Jessica and Paul, who discloses his plan to marry one of Emperor Shaddam's daughters to avert a potential civil war arising from the Emperor's betrayal. They are discovered by Sardaukar soldiers armed with a lasgun, and Duncan sacrifices himself, enabling Paul and Jessica's escape. Kynes also tries to escape but is caught and mortally wounded, and lures a sandworm to her location to devour herself and the Sardaukar. Deep in the desert, Paul and Jessica encounter Stilgar's Fremen tribe, including Chani, the young woman from Paul's visions. When Stilgar commands lenience towards them, Fremen warrior Jamis challenges his authority, and challenges them to a ritual duel to the death, which Paul accepts and wins. Contrary to Jessica's wishes, Paul joins the Fremen, determined to fulfill his father's goal of bringing peace to Arrakis.",

The Ministry of Magic detects Harry using magic and expels him from Hogwarts, though he is later exonerated. The Order of the Phoenix, a secret organisation founded by Albus Dumbledore, informs Harry that the Ministry of Magic is attempting to stonewall rumors about Lord Voldemort's return. At the Order's headquarters, Harry's godfather, Sirius Black, mentions that Voldemort seeks an object he previously lacked; Harry believes it to be a weapon. Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge has appointed Dolores Umbridge as Hogwarts new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. Umbridge's refusal to teach defensive spells causes her and Harry to clash. Harry is forced to write lines for \"lying\" about Voldemort; a magic quill etches the words into his hand as he writes. Ron and Hermione are outraged, but Harry refuses to tell Dumbledore, who has distanced himself from Harry. As Umbridge gains more control over the school, Ron and Hermione help Harry form \"Dumbledore's Army\", a secret group to teach students defensive spells. Umbridge recruits Slytherins for an Inquisitorial Squad to spy on the other students. Meanwhile, Harry and Cho Chang develop romantic feelings for each other. One night, Harry envisions Arthur Weasley being attacked at the Ministry, seeing it from the attacker's perspective. Concerned that Voldemort will exploit this connection to Harry, Dumbledore has Severus Snape teach Harry Occlumency to defend his mind from Voldemort's influence. During a lesson, Harry sees Snape's memories of how his father, James, bullied and tormented Snape in school. The connection between Harry and Voldemort further isolates Harry from his friends. Meanwhile, Bellatrix Lestrange, Sirius's deranged Death Eater cousin, escapes Azkaban prison along with nine other Death Eaters. At Hogwarts, Umbridge and her Inquisitorial Squad expose Dumbledore's Army. Dumbledore, falsely accused of forming it, escapes as Fudge orders his arrest. Harry believes Cho betrayed Dumbledore's Army to Umbridge, ending their budding relationship. Umbridge becomes the new Headmistress. Harry experiences a vision that Voldemort is torturing Sirius. Harry, Ron, and Hermione rush to Umbridge's office to alert the Order via the Floo Network. Umbridge catches them and, as she is about to severely punish Harry, Hermione claims Dumbledore has hidden a \"secret weapon\" in the Forbidden Forest. She and Harry lead Umbridge to where Hagrid's giant half-brother, Grawp is kept. The centaurs confront them and kidnap Umbridge after she insults and attacks them. Harry, Hermione, Ron, Luna, Neville and Ginny fly to the Ministry of Magic on Thestrals to save Sirius. The six enter the Department of Mysteries and recover the object that Voldemort is after, a bottled prophecy labelled with Harry's name. Death Eaters ambush them, including Lucius Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange. Lucius reveals that Harry's vision of Sirius being tortured was a ruse to lure him there. Harry refuses to give Lucius the prophecy, and a fight ensues. The Death Eaters overpower the students and force Harry to surrender the prophecy. When Harry hands it to Lucius, Sirius and Remus Lupin arrive with Order members, including Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley Shacklebolt and Mad-Eye Moody. Lucius accidentally drops the prophecy during the chaos, destroying it. Just as Sirius overpowers Lucius, Bellatrix kills Sirius. Voldemort appears, but moments before he can kill Harry, Dumbledore arrives. A violent duel erupts, destroying much of the Atrium, while Bellatrix escapes. The two wizards are evenly matched, so Voldemort possesses Harry's body, wanting Dumbledore to sacrifice him. The love Harry feels for his friends and family quickly drives out Voldemort. Ministry officials arrive before Voldemort disapparates; Fudge admits that Voldemort has returned and resigns in disgrace. Umbridge is dismissed and Dumbledore returns as Hogwarts headmaster. Dumbledore explains he had distanced himself from Harry to prevent Voldemort exploiting their connection. He also reveals the prophecy. As he grieves Sirius's death, Harry tries to accept the prophecy: \"Neither can live while the other survives.\"",

On her first day at the Zootopia Police Department (ZPD), she is given parking duty by Chief Bogo and is hustled by red fox con artist Nick Wilde and his partner Finnick during her shift. The next day, Judy abandons her post to arrest small-time crook Duke Weaselton for stealing a bag of crocus bulbs. While Bogo is reprimanding Judy, Mrs. Otterton visits his office, pleading for someone to find her husband, Emmitt, one of several predators who have gone missing. Without seeking prior approval, Judy volunteers, and Bogo attempts to fire her for insubordination. When the city's assistant mayor, ewe Dawn Bellwether, praises Judy for taking the assignment, he agrees but demands Judy's resignation if she cannot close the case within 48 hours. Having ascertained that Nick was the last to see Emmitt, Judy blackmails him into helping her by recording his confession to tax evasion. Tracking a limousine that picked up Emmitt, they learn the vehicle is owned by Mr. Big, an arctic shrew crime boss whom Nick has a history with. Mr. Big explains that Emmitt unexpectedly \"went savage\" and mindlessly attacked the limousine's chauffeur Renato Manchas, a black jaguar. Judy and Nick question Manchas, who explains that Emmitt yelled about \"Night Howlers\" before attacking him. Manchas also suddenly turns savage and pursues them. Judy traps Manchas and alerts the ZPD, but Manchas vanishes before backup arrives. Bogo demands Judy's resignation, but Nick reminds him that Judy still has ten hours left to solve the case. He later reveals to her that as a child, he was bullied by his peers due to their prejudiced beliefs about foxes. At City Hall, Bellwether allows them access to Zootopia's traffic cameras, which reveal Manchas was abducted by timberwolves, whom Judy assumes are the Night Howlers. Following the wolves, Judy and Nick locates Emmitt and the other missing predators, who are all \"savage\" and imprisoned in an asylum. Zootopia's mayor, Leodore Lionheart, had ordered the quarantine and is trying to determine what caused their feral behavior. Lionheart and the asylum staff are arrested, and Bellwether becomes the new mayor. Judy, praised for solving the case, invites Nick to join the ZPD as her partner. At a press conference, she accidentally implies that the predators' physiology caused the savageness epidemic. Disappointed and offended, Nick abandons Judy, whose comments incite fear and discrimination against predators throughout Zootopia. Wracked with guilt, she quits her job and returns to Bunnyburrow. Later, while managing her parents’ vegetable stand, Judy learns that Night Howlers are actually Midnicampum flowers, which have severe, lasting psychotropic effects if ingested. Realizing that someone is using the flowers to turn predators savage, she returns to Zootopia and reconciles with Nick. Aided by Mr. Big, they interrogate Weaselton, who admits that a ram named Doug hired him to steal the Night Howler bulbs. They find Doug in his laboratory hidden in the subway, where he manufactures a serum from the Night Howlers to use against predators via a tranquilizer dart. Judy and Nick obtain a serum pistol as evidence after a pursuit in the subway, but before they can reach the ZPD, Bellwether confronts them in the Natural History Museum and reveals herself to have masterminded a prey-supremacist conspiracy. Bellwether traps Judy and Nick in an exhibit, shoots Nick with the serum pistol in an attempt to have Judy killed and orders the ZPD to capture him, but Judy and Nick reveal that they had replaced the darts with blueberries and recorded Bellwether's confession. Bellwether and her accomplices are arrested, while the still-incarcerated Lionheart publicly disregards her scheme, insisting that imprisoning the infected predators was \"doing the wrong thing for the right reason\". The predators are cured and rehabilitated, and Judy is reinstated into the ZPD. Months later, Nick graduates from the police academy, becoming Judy's partner and the first fox police officer.",

    "plot": "A dark grey cat wanders through a forest. A pack of dogs arrives by the river and chases the cat after it takes a fish the dogs fought over. The cat escapes, but notices a deer stampede before it is caught in a massive flood. The cat and dogs survive the flood and reach higher ground. A yellow Labrador Retriever from the pack follows the cat to its abandoned cabin with wooden cat sculptures. They both notice the water level rising, and the Labrador joins the other dogs on a passing boat. As the flood consumes the cabin, the cat climbs atop a giant cat statue until the waters reach the top of the statue's head. As the rising water completely submerges the statue, the cat jumps into an approaching sailboat with a capybara aboard. The next morning, as the boat sails through a partially submerged forest, the cat goes overboard and begins to sink while trying to avoid a white secretarybird. A mutated whale saves it from drowning, but another secretarybird seizes it and, during the flight, the cat catches a glimpse of massive stone pillars in the distance. The secretarybird then releases the cat over the boat. Soon after, as the water level continues to rise, the capybara invites a ring-tailed lemur to hop aboard with its basket of trinkets, including a mirror. While sleeping, the cat has a nightmare where it is being circled by a herd of deer, and looks to the massive stone pillars, before being swept away by a flood. Later that day, the three animals land on shore and are joined by the Labrador. They encounter a flock of secretarybirds that show hostility toward them, causing the cat to run away. The younger secretarybird that first encountered the cat pleads with the leader to spare its life, only to lose in a duel and have its wing injured before the flock abandons it. With a diminished ability to fly, the secretarybird joins the crew. The crew arrives at a half-submerged city near the base of the massive stone pillars. The Labrador takes the lemur's glass float to the secretarybird, to play fetch, but the secretarybird kicks it off the boat. The lemur gets angry and starts fighting with the secretarybird, who is steering the boat. Due to loss of control, the boat's mast is caught in a tree. The whale breaches out of the water, and the waves generated help free the boat from the tree. After learning from the capybara, the cat improves its ability to swim and catch fish. Later, the crew sees the other dogs stranded in a bell tower, and rescue them. As the boat sails through the huge stone pillars during a heavy storm, the secretarybird flies away. The cat falls off the boat, but swims ashore. It climbs the stairs to the top of a stone pillar and finds the secretarybird there, on a labyrinth-like carving on the floor. For a short duration, gravity vanishes and a bright portal opens above them. They are both temporarily weightless, but the cat floats back to the ground, while the secretarybird flies toward the light and disappears. The cat rushes down the stairs and tries to swim back to the boat, but it is too far. It finds the lemur's glass float, and uses it to stay afloat. The water level drops quickly as massive fault lines open in the earth, draining the water. While roaming through the forest, the cat finds the lemur, and they find the boat hanging on a tree soon after. The dogs jump off the boat, but just as the capybara is about to exit, the tree begins to fracture. The cat climbs the tree and passes the boat's rope to the lemur and dogs, who pull the boat toward them. When a rabbit scampers by, the other dogs abandon the Labrador and its friends to chase it. The cat falls, but is caught by the capybara. They both manage to jump off the boat before it falls with the tree into a ravine below. Just as the crew celebrates, another deer stampede occurs. The cat flees, but stops when it comes upon the whale beached in the forest. The cat comforts the whale and looks at the massive stone pillars. Saddened by the whale's loss, the cat sees its reflection in a puddle of water as it is joined by its friends. In a post-credits scene, a whale is seen surfacing on the ocean.",

    "plot": "A \"stereotypical\" Barbie and fellow dolls reside in Barbieland, a matriarchal society populated by different versions of Barbie, Ken, and a group of discontinued models who are treated like outcasts due to their unconventional traits. While the Kens spend their days playing at the beach, considering it their profession, the Barbies hold prestigious jobs in law, science, politics, and so on. Ken (\"Beach Ken\") is only happy when he is with Barbie, and he seeks a closer relationship with her, but she rebuffs him in favor of other activities and female friendships. One evening at a dance party, Barbie is suddenly stricken with worries about mortality. Overnight, she develops bad breath, cellulite, and flat feet, disrupting her routines and impairing the aura of classic perfection experienced by the Barbies. Weird Barbie, a disfigured doll, tells Barbie to find the child playing with her in the real world to cure her afflictions. Barbie follows the advice and she travels to the real world, with a Ken joining Barbie by stowing away in her convertible. After arriving in Venice Beach, Barbie punches a man after he gropes her. She is briefly arrested, and then Barbie and Ken are both arrested after not paying for new clothes. Alarmed by the dolls' presence in the real world, the CEO of Mattel orders their recapture. Barbie tracks down her owner, a teenage girl named Sasha, who criticizes Barbie for encouraging unrealistic beauty standards. Distraught, Barbie discovers that Gloria, a Mattel employee and Sasha's mother, inadvertently caused Barbie's existential crisis after starting to play with Sasha's old Barbie dolls and drawing Barbie dolls with dark emotions and thoughts. Mattel finds Barbie and attempts to put her in a toy box for remanufacturing, but she escapes with the help of a mysterious elderly woman named Ruth. Gloria and Sasha arrive just in time to rescue Barbie from Mattel's executives, and the three travel to Barbieland with the executives in pursuit. Meanwhile, Ken learns about patriarchy and feels respected for the first time. He returns to Barbieland to persuade the other Kens to take it over. The Kens begin to indoctrinate the Barbies into submissive roles, such as agreeable girlfriends, housewives, and maids. Barbie arrives and attempts to convince the Barbies to be independent again, but becomes depressed when she fails. Gloria expresses her frustration with the conflicting standards women are forced to follow in the real world. Gloria's speech restores Barbie's confidence. With the assistance of Sasha, Weird Barbie, Allan, and the discontinued dolls, Gloria uses her knowledge from the real world to deprogram the Barbies from their indoctrination. The Barbies then manipulate the Kens into fighting among themselves, which distracts them from enshrining male superiority into Barbieland's constitution, allowing the Barbies to regain power. Having now experienced systemic oppression for themselves, the Barbies resolve to rectify the faults of their previous society, emphasizing better treatment of the Kens and all outcasts. Barbie and Ken make amends, acknowledging their past mistakes. When Ken bemoans his lack of purpose without Barbie, she encourages him to find an autonomous identity. Barbie, who remains unsure of her own identity, meets with the spirit of Ruth Handler, Mattel co-founder and creator of the Barbie doll, who explains that Barbie's story has no set ending and her ever-evolving history surpasses her roots. After bidding goodbye to the other dolls and Mattel executives, Barbie decides to become human again and return to the real world. Sometime later, Gloria, her husband, and Sasha take Barbie, now going by the name \"Barbara Handler\", to her first gynecologist appointment.",

After seeing a significant water main leak on the news, Mario and Luigi go underground to fix it but are sucked into a Warp Pipe and separated. Mario lands in the Mushroom Kingdom, ruled by Princess Peach, while Luigi arrives in the Dark Lands, ruled by the evil Koopa king Bowser. Bowser seeks to marry Peach and will destroy the Mushroom Kingdom using a Super Star if she refuses. Seeing Mario as a competition for Peach's love, Bowser imprisons Luigi to threaten him. Mario meets Toad, who takes him to Peach. Peach plans to ally with the primate Kongs to help repel Bowser, and trains Mario before allowing him and Toad to travel along. During their journey, she tells Mario that she ended up in the Mushroom Kingdom as a baby, where the Toads took her in and eventually made her their leader. In the Jungle Kingdom, King Cranky Kong agrees to help if Mario defeats his son, Donkey Kong, in a fight. Despite initially being overpowered by Donkey Kong's strength, Mario defeats him using a Cat Suit. Mario, Peach, Toad, and the Kongs use karts to drive back to the Mushroom Kingdom, where Bowser's army ambushes them on Rainbow Road. When a blue-shelled Koopa General destroys part of the road, Mario and Donkey Kong plummet to the ocean while the other Kongs are captured. Peach and Toad return to the Mushroom Kingdom and urge the citizens to evacuate. Bowser arrives aboard his flying castle and proposes to Peach, who reluctantly accepts after Bowser's advisor Kamek tortures Toad. Mario and Donkey Kong, having been swallowed by a giant eel, learn they both want the respect of their fathers. They escape the eel by riding a rocket barrel from Donkey Kong's kart and hurry to Bowser and Peach's wedding. At the wedding ceremony, Bowser intends to sacrifice all of his prisoners in Peach's honor. Toad smuggles an Ice Flower into Peach's bouquet, which she uses to freeze Bowser and the chain lowering the prisoners into the lava. Mario and Donkey Kong fight their way through Bowser's army and free the prisoners, with Mario using a Tanooki Suit to save Luigi. Bowser frees himself and launches a Bomber Bill to destroy the Mushroom Kingdom, but Mario knocks it off-course and directs it into the Warp Pipe, where it detonates, creating a vacuum that sucks Bowser's castle and its occupants into Brooklyn. Mario attempts to grab the Star but is attacked by the enraged Bowser, who swiftly defeats Peach, Toad, and Donkey Kong. Mario sees his business' commercial on a television and is motivated to face Bowser, who almost incinerates him. Luigi saves Mario, and they both grab the Super Star. Becoming temporarily invincible, they defeat the Koopas, destroy Bowser's castle, and incapacitate him. Peach shrinks Bowser with a blue Mini Mushroom before Toad imprisons him in a jar.

    "plot": "In 1989, Kevin Flynn, who was promoted to CEO of ENCOM International seven years earlier, disappears. Twenty years later, his son Sam, now ENCOM's primary shareholder, pranks the corporation by releasing the company's signature operating system online for free. ENCOM executive Alan Bradley, Kevin's old friend, approves of this, believing it aligns with Flynn's ideals of free software; nonetheless, Sam is arrested for trespassing. Alan posts bail for Sam and tells him of a pager message originating from Flynn's shuttered video arcade, after being disconnected for 20 years. There, Sam discovers a hidden basement with a large computer and laser, which suddenly digitizes and downloads him into the Grid, a virtual reality created by Kevin. He is captured and sent to \"the Games\", where he must fight a masked computer program named Rinzler. When Sam is injured and bleeds, Rinzler realizes Sam is human, or a \"User\". He takes Sam to Clu, the Grid's corrupt ruling program, who resembles a young Kevin. Clu nearly kills Sam in a Light Cycle match, but Sam is rescued by Quorra, an \"apprentice\" of Flynn, who shows him Kevin's hideout outside Clu's territory. Kevin explains that he had been working to create a \"perfect\" computer system and had appointed Clu and security program Tron as its co-creators. The trio discovered a species of naturally occurring \"isomorphic algorithms\" (ISOs), with the potential to resolve various natural mysteries. Clu, considering them an aberration, betrayed Kevin, killed Tron, and destroyed the ISOs. The \"Portal\" permitting travel between the two worlds closed, leaving Kevin trapped in the system. Clu sent the message to Alan hoping to lure him into the Grid (though Sam serves his purpose just as well) and reopen the Portal for a limited time. Since Flynn's \"identity disc\" is the master key to the Grid and the only way to traverse the Portal, Clu expects Sam to bring Kevin to the Portal so he can take Flynn's disc, go through the Portal himself, and impose his idea of perfection on the human world. Against his father's wishes, Sam returns to Clu's territory and encounters one of the Sirens, Gem, to help find Zuse, a program who can provide safe passage to the Portal. At the End of Line Club, the owner reveals himself to be Zuse, then betrays Sam to Clu's guards. In the resulting fight, Kevin rescues his son, but Quorra is injured and Zuse gains possession of Flynn's disc. Zuse attempts to bargain with Clu over the disc, but Clu instead destroys the club along with Zuse and Gem. Kevin and Sam stow away aboard a \"Solar Sailer\" transport program, where Flynn restores Quorra and reveals her to be the last surviving ISO. The transport is intercepted by Clu's warship. As a diversion, Quorra allows herself to be captured by Rinzler, whom Kevin recognizes as Tron, not killed by Clu but rather reprogrammed. Sam reclaims Flynn's disc and rescues Quorra, while Kevin takes control of a Light Fighter. Clu, Rinzler, and several guards pursue the trio in Light Jets. Rinzler remembers his past as Tron and deliberately collides with Clu's Light Jet, then falls into the Sea of Simulation below. Clu confronts the others at the Portal, but Kevin reintegrates with his digital duplicate, destroying Clu along with himself. Quorra – having switched discs with Kevin – gives Flynn's disc to Sam, and they escape together to the real world as the ensuing explosion from Kevin's sacrifice levels the Sea of Simulation. In Flynn's Arcade, Sam backs up and deactivates the system. He then tells a waiting Alan that he plans to retake control of ENCOM, naming Alan chairman of the board. Sam departs on his motorcycle with Quorra as the sun rises.",

    "plot": "In 2018, 23 days after Thanos erased half of all life in the universe, Carol Danvers rescues Tony Stark and Nebula from deep space. They reunite with the remaining Avengers—Bruce Banner, Steve Rogers, Thor, Natasha Romanoff, and James Rhodes—and Rocket on Earth. Locating Thanos on an uninhabited planet, they plan to use the Infinity Stones to reverse his actions but find that Thanos has destroyed them. Enraged, Thor decapitates Thanos. Five years later, Scott Lang escapes from the Quantum Realm. Reaching the Avengers Compound, he explains that he experienced only five hours while trapped. Theorizing that the Quantum Realm allows time travel, they ask a reluctant Stark to help them retrieve the Stones from the past to reverse Thanos's present actions. Stark, Rocket, and Banner, who has merged his intelligence with the Hulk's strength, build a time machine. Banner notes that altering the past does not affect the present; any changes create alternate realities. Banner and Rocket travel to Norway, where they visit the Asgardian refugee settlement of New Asgard and recruit an overweight, despondent Thor. In Tokyo, Romanoff recruits Clint Barton, who became a vigilante after the erasure of his family. Banner, Lang, Rogers, and Stark time-travel to New York City during Loki's attack in 2012. At the Sanctum Sanctorum, Banner convinces the Ancient One to give him the Time Stone after promising to return the Infinity Stones to their proper points in time. At Stark Tower, Rogers retrieves the Mind Stone from Hydra sleeper agents; Stark and Lang's attempt to steal the Space Stone fails, allowing 2012-Loki to escape with it. Rogers and Stark travel to Camp Lehigh in 1970, where Stark obtains an earlier version of the Space Stone and encounters his father, Howard. Rogers steals Pym Particles from Hank Pym to return to the present and sees his lost love, Peggy Carter. Rocket and Thor travel to Asgard in 2013; Rocket extracts the Reality Stone from Jane Foster. Thor is encouraged by his mother, Frigga, and retrieves his old hammer, Mjolnir. Barton, Romanoff, Nebula, and Rhodes travel to 2014; Nebula and Rhodes go to Morag and steal the Power Stone before Peter Quill can, while Barton and Romanoff travel to Vormir. The Soul Stone's keeper, Red Skull, says that it can only be acquired by sacrificing a loved one. Romanoff sacrifices herself, allowing Barton to get the Stone. Rhodes and Nebula attempt to return to their own time, but Nebula is incapacitated when her cybernetic implants link with her past self; this allows 2014-Thanos to learn about his future self's success and the Avengers' attempt to undo it. 2014-Thanos sends 2014-Nebula forward in time to prepare for his arrival. Reuniting in the present, the Avengers place the Stones into a gauntlet that Stark, Banner, and Rocket have built. Banner, who has the most resistance to their radiation, uses the gauntlet to undo Thanos's disintegrations. Meanwhile, 2014-Nebula (impersonating her future self) uses the time machine to transport 2014-Thanos and his warship to the present and destroys the Avengers Compound. Present-day Nebula convinces 2014-Gamora to betray Thanos, but is unable to convince 2014-Nebula and kills her. Thanos overpowers Stark, Thor and a Mjolnir-wielding Rogers; he summons his army to retrieve the Stones, intent on using them to destroy the universe and create a new one. A restored Stephen Strange arrives with other sorcerers, the restored Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy, the Ravagers, and the armies of Wakanda and Asgard to fight Thanos's army. Danvers also arrives and destroys Thanos's warship, but Thanos overpowers her and seizes the gauntlet. Stark steals the Stones and uses them to disintegrate Thanos and his army, sacrificing himself. After Stark's funeral, Thor appoints Valkyrie as the new king of New Asgard and joins the Guardians. Rogers returns the Stones and Mjolnir to their proper timelines and remains in the past to live with Carter. In the present, an elderly Rogers passes his shield to Sam Wilson.",

Thus she begins creating an army of newborn vampires to help her get revenge on Edward Cullen, who killed her lover James Witherdale. In Forks, Edward and his human girlfriend Bella Swan discuss her desire to be turned into a vampire, but Edward wants her to stay human. He asks her to marry him, but she is reluctant, even after Edward promises to turn her into a vampire if she agrees. Bella talks with her father, Charlie, who decides to lift Bella’s house arrest if she promises to spend more time with her other friends and Jacob Black, her childhood friend and a werewolf with a strong dislike for vampires and Edward. Edward's clairvoyant sister, Alice Cullen, foresees the newborn vampire army, led by Riley, attacking Forks. Edward's family chase Victoria through the forest, but she escapes into werewolf territory, causing an incident between the vampires and the werewolves that flares up tensions between them. Edward decides to keep all this a secret from Bella. At school, Edward and Jacob have a tense meeting, where Jacob reveals the incident to Bella. She is annoyed with Edward keeping things from her, so decides to leave with Jacob, and starts spending more time with him and his tribe. Eventually Jacob confesses his love to her. She tells him she's in love with Edward, but he refuses to believe it, and kisses her. She angrily punches him, but hurts her hand on his hard werewolf body. Later, Jacob apologizes for his behavior, and Bella forgives him. The Cullens forge an uneasy alliance with the werewolf tribe to defend against Victoria's oncoming attack, and train together. During the training, Alice's partner, Jasper Hale, tells Bella that he was once part of a newborn army and hated himself, but eventually experienced happiness once he fell in love with Alice. Bella and Edward spend the night alone in his family home and, afraid how her feelings will change after being turned into a vampire, she agrees to marry him if he agrees to have sex with her. The two make out, but Edward finds it too dangerous, and explains that he wants to wait until marriage, after which he shows Bella his mother's ring and asks her to marry him, and she says yes. They use Bella's blood to bait the newborn vampire army, and Edward and Bella camp in the mountains away from the fight to keep her safe. They discuss their engagement, which Jacob overhears, after which he storms off. Bella chases Jacob and desperately asks him to kiss her, which they do. Bella explains to Edward that although she loves Jacob, her love for Edward is stronger. They get interrupted when Victoria and her army attack. The Cullen family together with the werewolves manage to fend off the attack, with Edward killing Victoria, but Jacob gets badly injured during the fight. After the werewolves carry Jacob to safety, the Volturi guard, who carry out vampire laws, arrive and find the Cullens guarding Bree Tanner one of the newborns whom Victoria created, surrendered. The Volturi torture and interrogate Bree, despite the Cullens' protests. When the Volturi note that Bella is still human, against their agreement, she explains the date for her transformation has been set. The leader of the Volturi guard sends one of her subordinates to kill Bree, with the Cullens too afraid to intervene. Afterwards, Bella visits the injured Jacob to tell him she has chosen to be with Edward, and he reluctantly accepts her decision. Bella and Edward talk about their upcoming wedding in their meadow. Edward questions why she is doing this, and Bella explains that she feels more herself in Edward's world and wants to be connected to him, and they decide to reveal their engagement to Bella's father.",

    "plot": "Following the defeat of House Atreides by House Harkonnen, Princess Irulan—daughter of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV—records in her journal her father's betrayal of the Atreides. On the planet Arrakis, a Fremen tribe led by Stilgar accompanies Paul Atreides and his pregnant Bene Gesserit mother Lady Jessica to Sietch Tabr. Some Fremen suspect they are spies, while Stilgar and others see signs of the prophecy that a mother and son from the \"Outer World\" will bring prosperity to Arrakis. The Fremen accept Paul, but Stilgar commands Jessica to succeed Sietch Tabr's dying Reverend Mother by ritually drinking the normally-fatal Water of Life. She uses her Bene Gesserit training to transmute the poisonous liquid and survive, inheriting the memories of past Reverend Mothers. The liquid prematurely awakens the mind of her unborn daughter, Alia, allowing Jessica to communicate with her. They agree to focus on convincing the more skeptical northern Fremen of the prophecy, which Chani and her friend Shishakli correctly deduce to be a myth fabricated by the Bene Gesserit to manipulate the Fremen. Nonetheless, Chani begins to respect Paul after he declares that he only seeks to fight alongside the Fremen, not rule them. Paul and Chani fall in love as Paul immerses himself in Fremen culture: learning their language, becoming a Fedaykin fighter, riding a sandworm, and raiding Harkonnen spice-harvesting operations. Paul adopts the Fremen names Usul (transl. \"the strength of a pillar\") and Muad'Dib (transl. \"kangaroo mouse\"). Due to the continuing spice raids, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen installs his cunning and sadistic nephew Feyd-Rautha as Arrakis' ruler. Lady Margot Fenring of the Bene Gesserit is sent to evaluate Feyd-Rautha as a prospective Kwisatz Haderach and secure his genetic lineage. Jessica travels south to unite with Fremen fundamentalists who believe most strongly in the prophecy. Paul remains in the north, fearful that his visions of an apocalyptic holy war will come to pass if he goes south as a messiah. During a raid on a smuggler spice harvester, Paul reunites with the warrior Gurney Halleck, who leads Paul to House Atreides' hidden atomic warhead stockpile. Feyd-Rautha unleashes a devastating attack on the northern Fremen, destroying Sietch Tabr, killing Shishakli, and forcing Paul and the survivors to journey south. Upon arrival, Paul drinks the Water of Life and falls into a coma. Jessica hypnotically compels Chani to save Paul; she gives Paul a mixture of her tears with the Water of Life, which awakens him. With his emerging prescience, Paul perceives countless possible futures and identifies a narrow path to victory, along with a vision of an adult Alia on a water-covered Arrakis. He also discovers that his mother Jessica, is the Baron's daughter, and that her union with Duke Leto Atreides was orchestrated by the Bene Gesserit to merge Harkonnen and Atreides bloodlines in their plan to create the Kwisatz Haderach. Paul meets with the southern Fremen war council, galvanizing the crowd by demonstrating his ability to discern their deepest thoughts. He declares himself the Lisan al Gaib—a messianic figure—and challenges the Emperor, who arrives on Arrakis with Irulan and the Sardaukar military force. As the Emperor chastises the Harkonnens for their failures, the Fremen launch an offensive, using atomics and sandworms to overpower the Sardaukar. Paul kills the Baron and captures the Emperor. Meanwhile, Gurney leads an assault on Arrakeen, intercepting and killing Feyd-Rautha's brother and subordinate Beast Rabban. Paul challenges the Emperor for the throne and, to Chani's dismay, demands to marry Irulan. Having been summoned by the Baron, the other Great Houses arrive in orbit, ready to invade the planet, but Paul threatens to destroy the spice fields if they intervene. Feyd-Rautha volunteers as the Emperor's champion and is killed by Paul in their duel. Irulan agrees to marry Paul on condition that he spare her father. The Emperor reluctantly surrenders, but the Great Houses reject Paul's ascendancy and Paul orders the Fremen to attack the orbiting fleet. As Stilgar leads the Fremen onto the captured Sardaukar ships, Jessica and Alia reflect on the beginning of Paul's holy war. Chani refuses to bow to Paul and prepares to depart alone on a sandworm.",

    "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest",
    "plot": "Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's wedding is interrupted by Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company, who arrives at Port Royal with arrest warrants, charging them for aiding Captain Jack Sparrow's escape. Commodore James Norrington, who has since resigned from the Royal Navy and disappeared after losing his ship, the HMS Dauntless, in a hurricane while pursuing Jack, also has a warrant. Meanwhile, aboard the Black Pearl, Jack is visited by Will's father, Bootstrap Bill Turner, who is now a crewman of the Flying Dutchman, captained by Davy Jones. He marks Jack with the Black Spot and reminds him that he previously bartered a deal with Jones to raise the Pearl from the depths in exchange for his freedom - a debt Jack failed to repay - and must now serve aboard the Dutchman or he will be dragged into Davy Jones' Locker by the Kraken. Meanwhile, revealing Letters of Marque intended for Jack signed by King George, Beckett offers to free Will and Elizabeth in exchange for Will recovering Sparrow's compass. Will finds Jack and his crew on an island and helps them escape from cannibals. Afterward, Jack visits voodoo priestess Tia Dalma, who helps in finding the Dead Man's Chest, which holds Davy Jones' still-beating heart; whoever has it can control Davy Jones. Will makes a deal with Jack to find the key to the chest in return for Jack's compass but is tricked into servitude with Jones' crew aboard the Dutchman in Jack's stead. Jones agrees to free Sparrow from servitude if he can provide 99 more souls. Will reunites with his father, Bootstrap Bill, aboard the Dutchman and learns that Jones possesses the key through a game of Liar's Dice. Will escapes with the key and climbs aboard the Edinburgh Trader. Jones summons the Kraken and sinks the ship, but Will manages to escape. Meanwhile, Elizabeth's father, Governor Swann, breaks her out of prison but is captured himself. Elizabeth steals the Letters of Marque from Beckett and makes her way to Tortuga, where she finds both Jack and a drunken Norrington. Jack tricks Elizabeth into using his compass to find Jones' chest. All parties arrive on Isla Cruces, where the chest is buried. A three-way sword fight breaks out between Jack, Will, and Norrington, who all want the heart for their respective goals: Jack wants to call off the Kraken and negate his debt to Jones; Will wants to release his father from the Dutchman; and Norrington intends to regain his life as a Navy officer. Norrington secretly steals the heart and the Letters of Marque in the chaos before running off, pretending to lure away the Dutchman crew. Jones and the Kraken attack the Pearl, killing most of the crew and destroying all but one of the Pearl's lifeboats. Jack uses the boat to flee the battle briefly but returns to help wound the Kraken with a net full of gunpowder and rum. Jack orders the survivors to abandon ship, but Elizabeth realizes the Kraken only wants Jack. Elizabeth tricks Jack and chains him to the mast so the crew can escape while the Kraken drags Jack and the Pearl to the depths. Seemingly satisfied that Sparrow's debt is settled, Jones opens the chest to find his heart missing. Norrington gives Beckett the Letters and Jones's heart, reinstating him in the Navy and allowing the East India Trading Company to gain control of Jones. Jack's crew returns to Tia Dalma, where they agree about the possibility of rescuing Sparrow at \"world's end\". Tia Dalma introduces their guide: the resurrected Hector Barbossa.",

    "plot": "In Ixtenco, Mexico, Nick Fury and Maria Hill investigate an unnatural storm and encounter the Earth Elemental. Quentin Beck, a super-powered individual, arrives and defeats the creature. Fury and Hill subsequently recruit him. In New York City, the Midtown School of Science and Technology completes its year, which was restarted to accommodate the students who disintegrated five years earlier due to Thanos's actions; they had reappeared un-aged, thanks to the actions of the Avengers. The school organizes a two-week summer field trip to Europe, where Peter Parker—who is still mourning the death of his mentor Tony Stark—plans to reveal to classmate MJ his attraction to her. Happy Hogan informs Parker that Fury intends to contact him, but Parker ignores Fury's phone call. Parker and his classmates travel to Venice, Italy, where the Water Elemental attacks. While Parker helps protect his classmates, Beck arrives and defeats the creature. Fury meets with Parker and gives him Stark's eyeglasses. The glasses enable him to communicate with and take command of the artificial intelligence E.D.I.T.H., which has access to Stark Industries' databases and commands a large orbital weapons supply. Beck claims to have entered from an alternate reality within the multiverse, where the four Elementals killed his family and destroyed his civilization. With only the Fire Elemental left to destroy, Beck predicts it will attack Prague, Czech Republic. Parker declines Fury's invitation to join the fight and returns to his class trip, but Fury secretly changes the class's itinerary to divert the students to Prague. Parker is forced to help Beck fight the Fire Elemental to again protect his friends. Beck manages to destroy the creature with Parker's help. Fury and Hill invite Parker and Beck to Berlin, Germany to discuss forming a new superhero team, but Parker decides that Beck should go alone and transfers control of E.D.I.T.H. to him. Once Parker leaves, Beck celebrates alongside ex-Stark Industries employees, with whom he had been working to masquerade as a superhero. Beck, who was fired from his position as Stark's holographic-illusions specialist due to his unstable nature, uses advanced projectors to simulate his powers and the Elementals. He plans to use E.D.I.T.H.'s orbital weaponized drones to increase the scale of his illusions and fraudulently establish himself as an Avenger-level hero. After MJ tells Parker she knows he is Spider-Man, they discover that a piece of debris she retrieved during the battle with the Fire Elemental is a projector and the pair realize Beck's deception. Parker travels to Berlin, to warn Fury, but Beck tricks him with an elaborate illusion, forcing him to reveal the names of his friends who know about Beck's plan, and causing Parker to get hit by a train. Beck is unaware that Parker, though injured, has survived. In the Netherlands, Parker contacts Hogan, who flies him to London, England, where his classmates are. Beck uses E.D.I.T.H. to orchestrate a fusion of all the Elementals. He intends to kill Parker's friends during the staged attack, as Beck is concerned that they will expose him with their knowledge. Parker disrupts the illusions and an enraged Beck attacks him with drones. Parker regains control of E.D.I.T.H. and defeats Beck, who is hit by a misfired gunshot from one of the drones. Before he dies, Beck tells his associate William Ginter Riva to retrieve data from the drones. After returning to New York City, Parker begins a relationship with MJ. In a mid-credits scene, J. Jonah Jameson of TheDailyBugle.net broadcasts doctored footage of the London incident in which Beck frames Spider-Man for the drone attack and his death before exposing Spider-Man's secret identity to the world, much to Parker's shock. In a post-credits scene, Fury and Hill are revealed to be the Skrulls Talos and Soren in disguise, under orders from the real Fury while he is away in space commanding a group of Skrulls.",

    "plot": "Lord Voldemort tightens his grip on the wizarding and Muggle worlds: his Death Eaters kidnap wandmaker Ollivander and destroy the Millennium Bridge. With Lucius Malfoy incarcerated in Azkaban, Voldemort chooses his son, Draco Malfoy, to carry out a secret mission at Hogwarts. Draco's mother, Narcissa, and aunt Bellatrix Lestrange seek out Severus Snape, who claims he is a spy in the Order of the Phoenix. Snape makes an Unbreakable Vow with Narcissa to protect Draco and fulfil his task should he fail. Harry Potter accompanies Albus Dumbledore to persuade former Potions professor Horace Slughorn to return to Hogwarts. At the Burrow, Harry reunites with his best friends Ron and Hermione. In Diagon Alley, they see Draco and Narcissa Malfoy, and follow them into Knockturn Alley. The pair meet with Death Eaters, including the werewolf Fenrir Greyback. When Harry believes Draco is now a Death Eater, Ron and Hermione are sceptical. At Hogwarts, Harry discovers that his used Potions textbook is filled with notes and spells added by the Half-Blood Prince. Using it, Harry excels in class, impressing Slughorn, who awards him a luck potion. Ron makes the Gryffindor Quidditch team as Keeper and begins dating Lavender Brown, upsetting Hermione, who harbours feelings for him. Harry consoles Hermione while acknowledging his own feelings for Ginny Weasley. Harry spends Christmas with the Weasleys. His suspicions about Draco are dismissed by the Order, but Arthur Weasley reveals that the Malfoys may be interested in a Vanishing Cabinet. Bellatrix and Greyback attack and destroy the Burrow. At Hogwarts, Dumbledore asks Harry to retrieve Slughorn's memory of a young Voldemort; Slughorn has resisted giving an accurate memory. After Ron accidentally ingests a love potion intended for Harry, Harry takes him to Slughorn for a cure. After curing Ron, Slughorn offers Harry and Ron mead. Ron is poisoned after drinking it, and while recovering in the infirmary Ron murmurs Hermione's name causing Lavender to end their relationship. Harry confronts Draco about the poisoned mead and also a cursed necklace that nearly killed Katie Bell. Harry and Draco duel, and Harry uses one of the Half-Blood Prince's curses that severely injures Malfoy, and he is only saved by Snape. Fearing the book contains Dark Magic, Ginny persuades Harry to hide it in the Room of Requirement, where they share their first kiss. Harry uses his luck potion to convince the reluctant Slughorn to surrender the memory Dumbledore needs. Viewing it in the Pensieve, Dumbledore and Harry learn Voldemort sought information about Horcruxes, magical objects containing pieces of a wizard's soul for immortality. Dumbledore believes Voldemort divided his soul into six Horcruxes, two of which have been destroyed: Tom Riddle's diary and Marvolo Gaunt's ring. They travel to a cave where Harry aids Dumbledore in drinking a potion that hides another Horcrux: Slytherin's locket. A weakened Dumbledore apparates them back to Hogwarts, where Bellatrix, Greyback, and the other Death Eaters have entered through the Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement that Draco has secretly connected to Knockturn Alley. As Harry hides, Draco appears and disarms Dumbledore, revealing Voldemort chose him to kill Dumbledore. Draco hesitates; Snape arrives and kills Dumbledore. As the Death Eaters escape, Harry attacks Snape, and he reveals to Harry that he is the Half-Blood Prince. As Hogwarts mourns Dumbledore's death, Harry tells Ron and Hermione that the locket is fake and contains a message from \"R.A.B.\", who stole the real Horcrux intending to destroy it. Harry, Ron and Hermione agree to abandon their final year at Hogwarts to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes.",

Griphook agrees, in exchange for the Sword of Gryffindor. Wandmaker Ollivander tells Harry that two wands taken from Malfoy Manor belonged to Bellatrix and Draco Malfoy; he senses Draco's wand has changed its allegiance to Harry when he took it from Draco. A horcrux, Helga Hufflepuff's cup, is found in Bellatrix's vault, but Griphook snatches the sword and abandons them. Trapped by security, they release the dragon guardian and flee Gringotts on its back. Harry has a vision of Lord Voldemort at Gringotts, furious at the theft. Harry also realises a Horcrux connected to Rowena Ravenclaw is hidden at Hogwarts. The trio apparate into Hogsmeade and Aberforth Dumbledore helps them, revealing that he was the one who sent Dobby to Malfoy Manor. He then reveals a secret passageway into Hogwarts, where Neville Longbottom guides them. Severus Snape threatens any staff or students aiding Harry. During a duel, Snape flees from Professor McGonagall, who then rouses Hogwarts for battle. Luna Lovegood advises Harry to consult Helena Ravenclaw's ghost. Helena reveals Voldemort used dark magic on her mother's diadem, which is hidden in the Room of Requirement. In the Chamber of Secrets, Ron and Hermione destroy the Horcrux cup with a Basilisk fang. Meanwhile, Draco, Blaise, and Goyle attack Harry, but Ron and Hermione intervene. Goyle casts an uncontrollable Fiendfyre curse that kills him, while Harry, Ron, and Hermione rescue Malfoy and Zabini and escape on brooms. Outside, Harry stabs the diadem with the Basilisk fang, and Ron kicks it into the fire. As Voldemort's army attacks, Harry realises Voldemort's snake Nagini is the final Horcrux. The trio overhears Voldemort telling Snape the Elder Wand cannot serve him until Snape dies. Nagini attacks Snape, then as he dies, he gives Harry one of his memories. Many members of the Order, students, and staff, including Fred Weasley, Remus Lupin, and Nymphadora Tonks, are then killed in the battle at Hogwarts. Harry views Snape's memory in the Pensieve: Snape and Harry's mother Lily were childhood friends; he was also in love with her, but she fell for Harry's father James, whom Snape despised for his arrogance and for bullying him. Harry also learns Snape attempted to protect Lily by pleading with Dumbledore to hide the Potters. Following her death, Snape worked with Albus Dumbledore as a double agent among the Death Eaters, to protect Harry from Voldemort. Harry also learns that Dumbledore was dying and planned for Snape to kill him, and that Snape conjured the Patronus doe that led Harry to Gryffindor's sword. Harry also learns that he inadvertently became a Horcrux when Voldemort's curse originally failed to kill him; Voldemort must now kill Harry to destroy the soul shard within him. Using the Resurrection Stone that had been stored in the Golden Snitch bequeathed to him, Harry sees the spirits of his parents, Sirius Black, and Remus. They comfort him before he returns to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest. Voldemort casts the Killing Curse upon Harry, who awakens in limbo. Dumbledore's spirit meets him and explains that Harry is now free of the link to Voldemort, and can choose to return to his body or move on. Voldemort returns with Harry's apparently dead body and demands Hogwarts surrender. As Neville takes the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat, Harry reveals he is alive, and the Malfoys abandon Voldemort along with many other Death Eaters. Molly Weasley kills Bellatrix in the Great Hall, and Neville beheads Nagini, destroying the last Horcrux. Harry defeats Voldemort when his Expelliarmus deflects Voldemort's Killing Curse back at him. After the battle, Harry explains to Ron and Hermione that Voldemort never commanded the Elder Wand; it recognised him as its true master after disarming Draco, who had previously disarmed Dumbledore. Instead of claiming the Elder Wand, Harry chooses to destroy it. Nineteen years later, Harry and Ginny Weasley, now married, watch as their youngest son leaves on the train at King's Cross to Hogwarts alongside Ron, Hermione, and their two children.",

After Puss recovers, the town doctor advises Puss to retire because he has already lost eight of his nine lives. Puss initially refuses but relents when he is wounded and disarmed while dueling a wolf at the local pub. Traumatized by the event, Puss follows the doctor's directions to the house of Mama Luna, an elderly cat lady, and buries his clothes. Months later, Puss meets an optimistic Chihuahua disguised as a cat, whom he calls Perrito. Crime family Goldilocks and the Three Bears soon arrive at Luna's home, intending to hire Puss to help them steal a map displaying the location of the Wishing Star. They leave after finding his apparent grave, and Puss decides to find the Star to wish for another nine lives. Perrito follows Puss to the factory lair of the corrupt pastry chef and magical artifact collector \"Big\" Jack Horner, who intends to use the Star to control all of the world's magic. While stealing the map from Horner, Puss encounters his resentful ex-fiancée Kitty Softpaws, who intends to take the map for herself. Goldi and the Bears, and Horner discover and chase the trio, and Puss briefly sees the wolf in the distance. They all end up in the Dark Forest, a pocket dimension that manifests illusions of travelers' memories. During the subsequent clash, Puss suffers a panic attack and flees after the wolf reappears, allowing Goldi to take the map from Kitty. After Perrito finds Puss and calms him down, Puss confesses his fears and remorse for abandoning Kitty before their wedding. She overhears Puss and tells him that she did not attend the wedding either, believing he loved himself too much to love her. Reinvigorated, Puss and Kitty retrieve the map while Goldi and the Bears are distracted by a manifestation of their woodland cottage. While escaping from Goldi and the Bears, Puss becomes trapped in a cave of the lost souls, where reflections of his past lives ridicule him for changing his outlook. The wolf arrives and reveals himself as Death, who is outraged by Puss' failure to value any of his lives and intends to take his final life personally. Horrified, Puss runs out of the cave towards the Star, leaving Kitty and Perrito behind. During an argument with Baby Bear, Goldi reveals she intends to wish for a human family. Though this hurts the Bears' feelings, they still agree to help her. Puss arrives at the Star and begins to make his wish, but Kitty arrives, berates him for his selfishness, and reveals she would have wished for someone she could trust. Goldi, the Bears, and Horner arrive, and a fight ensues for the map. Goldi briefly obtains it but abandons it to save Baby Bear, while Kitty traps Horner inside his magical bottomless bag. Death arrives and challenges Puss to a duel. Having learned the value of a single life from his time with his companions, Puss forgoes wishing for more lives and accepts Death's challenge. They duel and Puss temporarily disarms Death. Puss declares that, while he can never truly defeat Death, he will never stop fighting for his last life. Realizing Puss is no longer arrogant, Death begrudgingly spares him and leaves, though he and Puss acknowledge that they will eventually meet again. Horner escapes the bag by eating a magic snack that transforms him into a giant. Perrito distracts him, allowing Puss, Kitty, and Goldi to destroy the map, which causes the Wishing Star to consume Horner and explode. Goldi affirms to the Bears that they are her true family, and they decide to take over Horner's business.

Miles' uncle Aaron takes him to an abandoned subway station to paint graffiti as a way to cheer him up. There, Miles is bitten by a radioactive spider and gains abilities similar to Spider-Man. Returning to the station where he got bit, he discovers a collider built by Kingpin, who hopes to access parallel universes to abduct alternate versions of his late wife Vanessa and son Richard. Spider-Man attempts to stop the collider while fighting Kingpin's enforcers, the Green Goblin and Prowler. Green Goblin shoves Spider-Man into the collider, causing an explosion that mortally wounds Spider-Man, who then gives Miles a USB flash drive designed to sabotage the collider, warning that the machine could destroy the city if reactivated. After watching in horror as Kingpin murders Spider-Man, Miles flees. As the city mourns Spider-Man's death, Miles tries to honor his legacy by becoming the new Spider-Man, but inadvertently damages the drive. At Spider-Man's grave, he meets Peter B. Parker, a middle-aged and world-weary Spider-Man from another dimension. The duo infiltrate Alchemax to steal data for a new flash drive. They are confronted by its proprietor, Olivia Octavius, who discovers that Peter will die from cellular decay if he remains in their dimension. Miles and Peter are saved by Gwen Stacy, a Spider-Woman from another dimension. They visit Spider-Man's aunt, May, who is sheltering more Spider-People who slipped into Miles' universe from other dimensions due to the collider's influence – Spider-Man Noir, Peni Parker and Spider-Ham – who are also deteriorating. Miles offers to help the others return home but they tell him he lacks experience. Distraught, Miles retreats to Aaron's home, where he discovers his uncle is Prowler. He returns to the Parker house, where the new drive is completed; he is followed by Kingpin's team. In the ensuing brawl, he reveals his identity to Aaron. Unwilling to murder his own nephew, Aaron attempts to spare Miles, but is fatally shot by Kingpin in retaliation and dies in Miles' arms. Miles flees just as Jefferson arrives on the scene and mistakes the new Spider-Man as his brother's murderer before regrouping with the other Spider-People. Not wanting to let Miles get killed, Peter restrains Miles and chooses to sacrifice himself by staying behind and deactivating the collider. Jefferson arrives outside the door of Miles' dorm room as he apologizes for his mistakes and expresses his faith in Miles, inspiring him. Miles manages to control his powers, escapes his restraints and creates his own Spider-Man suit. He joins his allies in defeating Kingpin's enforcers and uses the new drive to send them home. Kingpin fights and overpowers Miles, attracting Jefferson's attention. Realizing that Spider-Man is not the menace he saw him as, he encourages Miles, who throws Kingpin at the collider's kill switch, destroying it. The city is saved and Kingpin's team is arrested as Jefferson receives evidence of Kingpin's murders of Aaron and the first Spider-Man. Miles embraces the responsibilities of his new life. Later, Gwen finds a way to contact Miles from her home dimension. Elsewhere, Miguel O'Hara travels to Earth-67 and ends up arguing with its Spider-Man.",

    "title": "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice",
    "plot": "In a flashback to his childhood, Bruce Wayne runs from his parents' funeral. He falls into a cave, where a circling vortex of bats elevates him back to the surface. In the present, eighteen months after his cataclysmic battle with General Zod in Metropolis, Superman has become a controversial figure. Bruce is now a billionaire who has operated in Gotham City as the masked vigilante Batman for twenty years. Having witnessed the battle in person, he sees Superman as an existential threat to humanity. Clark Kent, Superman's civilian identity, seeks to condemn Batman's form of justice in Daily Planet articles. Bruce learns that Russian weapon trafficker Anatoli Knyazev has been contacting LexCorp mogul Lex Luthor. Luthor attempts to persuade US Senator June Finch to allow him to import kryptonite discovered in the aftermath of Zod's terraforming attempt, so that it can be used as a deterrent against future Kryptonian threats. She declines, but Luthor makes alternative plans with Finch's subordinate, who grants him access to Zod's corpse and the Kryptonian scout ship. Bruce attends a gala at LexCorp to steal encrypted data from the company's mainframe, but antiquities dealer Diana Prince steals it first; she later returns it to Bruce. While decrypting the drive, Bruce dreams of a postapocalyptic world where he leads rebels against an evil Superman. He is awakened by an unidentified person, appearing through a portal, who tells him that Lois Lane is \"the key\" and urges him to find \"the others\" before vanishing. The decrypted drive reveals Luthor's files on several metahumans across the globe. One is Diana, who appears in a photo from World War I. Wayne contemplates weaponizing the kryptonite to go to war with Superman. A widely publicized congressional hearing, being held at the US Capitol, led by Finch, is held to question Superman's actions against Zod. A bomb smuggled in by Luthor detonates, killing everyone present except Superman. Superman blames himself for not detecting it in time and self-imposes exile. In response, Batman breaks into LexCorp and steals the kryptonite. He builds a powered exoskeleton, a kryptonite grenade launcher, and a kryptonite-tipped spear. Meanwhile, Luthor enters the Kryptonian ship and accesses its vast database of technology. Luthor lures Superman out of exile by kidnapping Martha Kent, Clark's adoptive mother, and Lois, who he pushes off the LexCorp building. Superman saves Lois and confronts Luthor, who reveals that the distrust between Batman and Superman was manipulated. Luthor demands that he kill Batman in exchange for Martha's life. Superman tries to explain this to Batman, who instead attacks and eventually subdues him using a kryptonite gas. As Batman prepares to deal the final blow using the spear, Superman pleads with him to \"save Martha\" – the same name as Batman's mother. Batman hesitates in confusion, as Lois arrives and explains what Superman meant. Coming to his senses, Batman locates and rescues Martha. Luthor executes his backup plan: unleashing a monster genetically engineered using DNA from both Zod's body and his own. Diana joins Batman and Superman in their fight against the creature.

    "title": "Iron Man 3",
    "plot": "At a New Year's Eve party in 1999, Tony Stark meets scientist Maya Hansen, the inventor of Extremis, an experimental regenerative treatment that allows recovery from crippling injuries. Disabled scientist Aldrich Killian offers them a place in his company Advanced Idea Mechanics (A.I.M.), but Stark rejects him. Thirteen years later, Stark is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and has frequent panic attacks due to his experiences during the alien invasion of New York. He has built dozens of new Iron Man suits to cope with his insomnia, creating friction with his girlfriend Pepper Potts. Meanwhile, a string of bombings is claimed by a terrorist known as the Mandarin. Stark's security chief Happy Hogan is badly injured in one such attack and is put into a coma, prompting Stark to issue a televised threat to the Mandarin, revealing his home address in the process. The Mandarin sends gunship helicopters to destroy Stark's home. Hansen, who came to warn Stark, survives the attack with Potts. Stark escapes in an experimental new Iron Man suit, which his artificial intelligence J.A.R.V.I.S. pilots to rural Tennessee, following a flight plan from Stark's investigation into the Mandarin. Stark's new armor is not fully functional and lacks sufficient power to return to Malibu, leading the world to believe that he died. With the help of Harley Keener, a local boy, Stark investigates the remains of a local explosion bearing the hallmarks of a Mandarin attack. However, it occurred years before any known attack by a terrorist. He discovers the \"bombings\" were triggered by soldiers subjected to Extremis whose bodies explosively rejected the treatment, and were falsely attributed by A.I.M. as a terrorist plot to cover up Extremis' flaws. Stark witnesses Extremis firsthand when Mandarin agents Savin and Brandt attack him. Stark kills Brandt and incapacitates Savin. Meanwhile, Killian resurfaces and kidnaps Potts with assistance from Hansen. American intelligence agencies continue to search for the Mandarin, with James Rhodes—the former War Machine, now re-branded as the Iron Patriot—lured into a trap to steal his armor. Tracing the Mandarin to Miami, Stark infiltrates his headquarters using improvised weapons. Inside, he discovers the Mandarin is an English actor named Trevor Slattery, who is oblivious to the actions carried out in his image. Killian, the real Mandarin behind Slattery's cover, then captures Stark. Killian, who appropriated Hansen's Extremis research as a cure for his own disability and expanded the program to include injured war veterans, reveals he has subjected Potts to Extremis in the hope Stark will help fix Extremis' flaws while trying to save her. When Hansen betrays Killian by threatening to jeopardize his operations, Killian kills her. Stark escapes and reunites with Rhodes, discovering that Killian intends to attack President Ellis aboard Air Force One, using the Iron Patriot armor, controlled by Savin. Stark kills Savin, saving the passengers and crew, but cannot stop Killian from abducting Ellis. At an impounded damaged oil tanker, Killian intends to kill Ellis on live television, so that the Vice President would then become a puppet leader following Killian's orders, in exchange for Extremis curing his young daughter's disability. Stark and Rhodes infiltrate the platform, aided by the Iron Man suits, remotely controlled by J.A.R.V.I.S.. Rhodes secures the President and takes him to safety, while Stark discovers Potts has survived the Extremis procedure. Before he can save her, a rig collapses around them, and she falls to the platform to her apparent death. Stark fights Killian but finds himself cornered. Potts, whose Extremis powers allowed her to survive the fall, kills Killian to save Stark. As a gesture of his devotion to Potts, Stark orders J.A.R.V.I.S. to destroy all the Iron Man suits. The Vice President and Slattery are arrested, and Happy awakens from his coma. With Stark's help, Potts's Extremis effects are stabilized. Stark promises to scale back his life as Iron Man, undergoing surgery to remove the shrapnel near his heart and throwing his obsolete chest arc reactor into the sea. He muses that, even without the technology, he will always be Iron Man.",

    "plot": "In the Valley of Peace, a land in Ancient China inhabited by anthropomorphic animals, Master Shifu, a cranky red panda, learns from his mentor, Master Oogway, a wise tortoise who is the founder of kung fu and the Valley's spiritual leader, that he has predicted Shifu's former apprentice, the snow leopard Tai Lung, will escape and attack the Valley for the Dragon Scroll, an artifact granting limitless power that he was denied. In response, Shifu sends his palace goose assistant Zeng to strengthen security at Chorh-Gom Prison, where Tai Lung is held and then holds a tournament to identify the Dragon Warrior, the prophesied hero worthy of reading the Scroll. A giant panda named Po, who helps his goose father Mr. Ping run their noodle restaurant but dreams of kung fu, arrives late to the tournament, eager to see his idols, the Furious Five—Tigress, Monkey, Crane, Viper, and Mantis—a group of kung fu masters trained by Shifu. Po tries various ways to enter the arena, and decides to use a chair propelled by fireworks, but unintentionally lands in front of the Five during the tournament as Oogway unexpectedly declares him the Dragon Warrior. Shifu believes Oogway's choice is an accident, and the Five dismiss Po after a rough first day of training, leaving him dejected and considering quitting. However, Oogway encourages him to persevere through Shifu's challenging training, and Po gradually befriends the Five with his resilience and humor. Tigress reveals that Shifu's toughness comes from his shame over Tai Lung's betrayal and having raised him as an infant. Meanwhile, Tai Lung uses one of Zeng's feathers to escape, eliminating the prison guards and sending Zeng back. Learning the bad news from Zeng, Shifu warns Oogway, who makes Shifu promise to believe in Po as the Dragon Warrior and names him his successor before ascending to the Spirit Realm. Shifu then tells Po and the Five about Tai Lung's escape, claiming Po is the only one who can stop him. Horrified by the goal and Oogway's death, Po tries to run away, but Shifu stops him. When asked why he stayed, Po admits he disliked his former self but believed Shifu could change him. Po then makes Shifu confess that he does not know how to train him as the Dragon Warrior. Tigress overhears and leads the Five in a secret attempt to stop Tai Lung themselves. Meanwhile, Shifu realizes Po's full potential for physical feats when food motivates him, so he trains Po in a unique kung fu style. The Five confront Tai Lung, who defeats them with his nerve-strike technique, leaving only Crane to return the Five as a warning. Shifu decides Po is ready for the Dragon Scroll, but Po discovers it is blank. Thinking the Scroll is powerless, Shifu sends Po and the Five to evacuate the Valley while he faces Tai Lung alone. To comfort a distraught Po, Mr. Ping reveals his \"secret ingredient soup\" has no secret ingredient at all, stating that belief can make things special. Understanding this is the Dragon Scroll's message, Po rushes back to help Shifu. At the Jade Palace, Tai Lung brutally defeats Shifu, only to find the Scroll is missing. Po arrives with the Scroll and engages Tai Lung in combat with confusing techniques to gain an advantage. Tai Lung gets the Scroll but cannot understand its blank surface. Enraged, he uses a nerve-strike on Po, who remains unaffected due to his body fat. Po overpowers Tai Lung and banishes him to the Spirit Realm with the Wuxi Finger Hold technique, which he taught himself, and is hailed as a hero by the Valley.",

    "plot": "In 1914, aliens known as Mondoshawans meet their contact on Earth, a priest of a secret order, at an ancient Egyptian temple. They take the only weapon capable of defeating a great evil that appears every 5000 years, promising to protect it and return it before the great evil's re-emergence. The weapon consists of the four classical elements, as four engraved stones, plus a sarcophagus containing a \"fifth element\". In the 23rd century, the great evil appears in deep space as a giant living fireball. It destroys an armed Earth spaceship as it heads to Earth. The Mondoshawans' current human contact on Earth, priest Vito Cornelius, informs the president of the Federated Territories of the great evil's history and the weapon that can stop it. On their way to Earth, a Mondoshawan spacecraft carrying the weapon is ambushed and destroyed by a crew of Mangalores, alien mercenaries hired by Earth industrialist Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg, who is working for the great evil. A severed hand in metal armor from the wreckage of the spacecraft is brought to New York City. From this, the government uses biotechnology to recreate the original occupant of the sarcophagus, a humanoid woman named Leeloo, who remembers her previous life. Alarmed by the unfamiliar surroundings and high security, she escapes and jumps off a ledge, crashing into the flying taxicab of Korben Dallas, a former major in Earth's special forces. Dallas delivers Leeloo to Cornelius and his apprentice, David, who recognizes her as the fifth element. As Leeloo recuperates, she tells Cornelius that the stones were not on board the Mondoshawan ship. Simultaneously, the Mondoshawans inform Earth's government that the stones were entrusted to an alien opera singer, the diva Plavalaguna. Zorg reneges on his deal with the Mangalores for failing to obtain the stones, and kills some of them. Earth's military sends Dallas to meet Plavalaguna; a rigged radio contest provides a cover, awarding Dallas a luxury vacation aboard a flying hotel on planet Fhloston, accompanied by flamboyant talk-show host Ruby Rhod. It includes a concert by Plavalaguna, and learning that Leeloo shares his mission, Dallas lets her accompany him. Cornelius instructs David to prepare the temple, then stows away on the luxury spaceship. The Mangalore crew, pursuing the stones for themselves, also illegally board the ship. During the concert, the Mangalores attack, and Plavalaguna is killed. Dallas extracts the stones from her body and kills the Mangalore leader, causing the others to surrender. Zorg arrives, shoots Leeloo, and activates a time bomb. He flees with a carrying case he presumes contains the stones, but returns when he discovers it is empty. As Zorg's bomb causes the hotel's evacuation, Dallas finds Leeloo traumatized and escapes with her, Cornelius, Rhod, and the stones in Zorg's private spaceship. Zorg deactivates his bomb, but a dying Mangalore sets off his own, destroying the hotel and killing Zorg. As the great evil approaches Earth, the four meet David at the temple. They deploy the stones, but Leeloo, having learned of humanity's history of cruelty, has given up on life. Dallas declares his love for her and kisses her. Leeloo combines the power of the stones, emitting divine light onto the great evil and defeating it. Dallas and Leeloo are hailed as heroes, and as dignitaries wait to greet them, the two passionately embrace in a recovery chamber.",

    "plot": "At their new headquarters on Knowhere, the Guardians of the Galaxy are attacked by Adam Warlock, a Sovereign warrior created by High Priestess Ayesha who seeks to destroy them for stealing from her. After critically wounding Rocket, Adam is stabbed by Nebula and flees. The Guardians' med-packs are ineffective at healing Rocket's wounds due to a kill switch embedded in him by the organization Orgocorp. The Guardians travel to Orgocorp's headquarters to find the switch's override code and save Rocket's life. As Rocket lies dying, he recalls his past. He was found and experimented on as a baby raccoon by the High Evolutionary, leader of Orgocorp, who aimed to enhance and anthropomorphize animal lifeforms into \"Humanimals\" for an ideal society, Counter-Earth. Rocket's fellow Batch 89 test subjects included the otter Lylla, walrus Teefs, and rabbit Floor. Impressed by Rocket's intelligence, the High Evolutionary used his insights to improve later batches of Humanimals. Angry that one of his creations could solve a problem that he could not, the High Evolutionary planned to harvest Rocket's brain and incinerate all of Batch 89. Rocket tried to rescue his friends, but the High Evolutionary killed Lylla and mocked Rocket's grief. Enraged, Rocket attacked the High Evolutionary while henchmen killed Teefs and Floor during the chaos. Rocket kills the henchmen and then escapes in a spaceship. In the present, an alternate version of Gamora, who has joined the Ravagers, helps the Guardians infiltrate Orgocorp. They retrieve Rocket's file but discover that Theel, one of the High Evolutionary's advisors, has removed the override code. The Guardians and Gamora travel to Counter-Earth to find him. They are followed by Ayesha and Adam after the High Evolutionary, their race's creator, threatened to wipe out the Sovereign if they failed to retrieve Rocket. At Counter-Earth, Drax and Mantis remain with Gamora and Rocket while Peter Quill, Groot, and Nebula go to the High Evolutionary's Arête Laboratories complex. Guards force Nebula to wait outside due to her cybernetic enhancements; Quill and Groot enter Arête. Drax tricks Mantis into pursuing Quill's group and Gamora saves Rocket from Adam and War Pig, one of the High Evolutionary's Hellspawn guards. The High Evolutionary agrees with Quill that Counter-Earth is imperfect and begins bombarding the entire planet, killing the Humanimals and Ayesha. Arête, which is actually a spaceship, departs as Nebula, Drax, and Mantis board it to rescue Quill and Groot. However, the latter pair jump off the spaceship with Theel, whom they kill before retrieving the override code from his corpse. They are rescued by Gamora on their ship. As they use the code, Rocket flatlines and has a near-death experience in which he reunites with Lylla, Teefs, and Floor. Lylla tells him his time has not yet come, and Quill succeeds in disabling the kill switch and restarting Rocket's heart. Drax, Nebula, and Mantis encounter the High Evolutionary's next batch of test subjects—genetically modified humanoid children—before they are captured. The other Guardians orchestrate a rescue, which leads to a battle against the High Evolutionary's forces. Kraglin opens fire on Arête with Knowhere and then helps to save Knowhere citizens from a counter-attack by the High Evolutionary's Hellspawn. Intent on retreat, the High Evolutionary's crew mutinies, but their leader kills them. Drax, Nebula, and Mantis befriend three monstrous Abilisks to escape and reunite with the rest of the Guardians. The Guardians delay leaving Arête, choosing to rescue the children, who escape to Knowhere via a tunnel constructed by Cosmo's telekinesis. Rocket discovers imprisoned animals on the ship and is confronted by the High Evolutionary, whom the other Guardians defeat. Rocket spares the High Evolutionary, and the Guardians help the animals escape to Knowhere. Quill nearly dies trying to reach Knowhere but is saved by Adam, whom Groot had earlier rescued from Arête's destruction. Quill decides to leave the Guardians, names Rocket as the new captain, and reunites with his grandfather Jason on Earth. Mantis embarks on a journey of self-discovery with the Abilisks, Gamora rejoins the Ravagers, and Nebula and Drax remain on Knowhere to raise the rescued children. The new Guardians—Rocket, Groot, Kraglin, Cosmo, Adam, Phyla (one of the rescued children), and Adam's pet Blurp—later take on a mission.",

    "plot": "A demon chases America Chavez and a version of Stephen Strange in the space between universes while searching for the Book of Vishanti. Strange is killed and Chavez accidentally creates a portal that transports herself and Strange's corpse to Earth-616, where that universe's version of Stephen Strange rescues Chavez from another demon with help from Wong, the Sorcerer Supreme. Chavez explains that the beings are hunting her because she has the power to travel through the multiverse. Recognizing witchcraft runes on the demon, Strange consults Wanda Maximoff but soon realizes that she is responsible for the attacks. After acquiring the Darkhold and becoming the Scarlet Witch, Wanda believes that taking Chavez's powers and traveling through the multiverse will allow her to reunite with Billy and Tommy, the children she created during her time in Westview. When Strange refuses to surrender Chavez, Wanda attacks Kamar-Taj and kills many sorcerers. Chavez accidentally transports herself and Strange to Earth-838. Wanda uses the Darkhold to \"dreamwalk\", taking control of her Earth-838 counterpart who lives a suburban life with her own Billy and Tommy. After a surviving sorceress, Sara, sacrifices herself to destroy the Darkhold and break the dreamwalk, an enraged Wanda forces Wong to lead her to Mount Wundagore, the source of the Darkhold's power, to reestablish the dreamwalk. While searching for help, Strange and Chavez are apprehended by Earth-838's Sorcerer Supreme, Karl Mordo, and brought before the Illuminati, a group consisting of Mordo, Peggy Carter, Blackagar Boltagon, Maria Rambeau, Reed Richards, and Charles Xavier. They explain that through reckless use of their universe's Darkhold in an attempt to defeat Thanos, Earth-838's Strange triggered a universe-destroying \"incursion\". After defeating Thanos, the Illuminati executed their Strange to prevent him from causing more harm. Mordo believes that Earth-616's Strange is similarly dangerous, but Wanda reestablishes her dreamwalk at Mount Wundagore and arrives in her Earth-838 counterpart's body before the Illuminati can pass judgment. She brutally kills all the Illuminati except Mordo, whom Strange subdues before fleeing with Chavez. The two escape with help from the Earth-838 version of Strange's ex-fiancé, Christine Palmer, a scientist working with the Illuminati. Strange, Chavez, and Palmer enter the space between universes to find the Book of Vishanti, which is the antithesis of the Darkhold, but Wanda appears and destroys it. She then takes over Chavez's mind and uses her powers to send Strange and Palmer to an incursion-destroyed universe. Strange defeats the destroyed universe's Strange, who has been corrupted by his Darkhold, and then uses that Darkhold to dreamwalk into the body of his deceased counterpart on Earth-616. With Wong's help, Strange saves Chavez from Wanda and encourages Chavez to use her abilities. Chavez transports Wanda to Earth-838, where she sees Billy and Tommy fearfully recoiling from her while crying for their real mother. Realizing her errors, Wanda relents and uses her powers to bring down Mount Wundagore, simultaneously destroying all copies of the Darkhold throughout the multiverse and sacrificing herself in the process. Chavez returns Strange and Palmer to their respective universes. Some time later, Kamar-Taj is under repair and the surviving sorcerers, joined by Chavez, continue training. Strange develops a third eye as a result of using the Darkhold and dreamwalking into a corpse. In a mid-credits scene, Strange is approached by a sorceress who warns that his actions have triggered an incursion that he must help repair. Strange follows her into the Dark Dimension.",

    "title": "Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire",
    "plot": "Three years after defeating Mechagodzilla, Kong has established his new territory in Hollow Earth and searches for more of his kind. On the Earth's surface, Godzilla continues to maintain order between humanity and giant monsters, known as \"Titans\"; killing Titanus Scylla in Rome, Italy, and resting in the Colosseum. A Monarch observation outpost stationed in Hollow Earth picks up an unidentified signal. On the surface, the signal causes Jia, the last known survivor of the Iwi tribe from Skull Island, to experience hallucinations and visions in school, causing her adoptive mother/Kong expert Dr. Ilene Andrews to worry. Also sensing the signal, Godzilla leaves Rome and attacks a nuclear plant in France to absorb radiation. He then heads to the lair of the Titan Tiamat in the Arctic. Monarch believes Godzilla is strengthening himself for an oncoming threat. When a sinkhole opens near his home, Kong discovers an uncharted realm where a tribe of his species has survived, including a juvenile ape named Suko. After a brief initial confrontation, Kong convinces Suko to lead him to the tribe's lair and the two slowly bond on their journey. Andrews, Jia, Titan veterinarian Trapper and conspiracy podcaster Bernie Hayes, travel to Hollow Earth to locate the source of the signal and find the Monarch outpost destroyed. As the group follows the signal, they discover a temple that leads them to a subterranean section, housing a surviving Iwi tribe, who communicate telepathically with each other and living beneath portals to the surface. Inspecting the temple, they realize that the signal was a telepathic distress call sent by the Iwi. While observing Jia socializing with the Iwi, Andrews voices her fears to Trapper that Jia may choose to stay with her people and that Andrews would have to accept it. Inside a temple, Andrews uncovers hieroglyphics displaying the past and future: a tyrannical ape titan known as the Skar King once attempted to conquer the surface world and waged war against Godzilla's species, triggering an ice age, but Godzilla defeated him by trapping the Skar King and his tribe deep within Hollow Earth. The prophecy also indicates that Jia is the key to reawakening Mothra. Kong encounters the tribe and confronts the Skar King. After a brief battle, Skar King resorts to summoning his enslaved ice-breathing Titan Shimo, using a crystal that causes her pain and forces her to take down Kong. Shimo's ice breath injures Kong's right arm, causing frostbite. With Suko's help, Kong manages to escape, though he loses his axe in the process. Sensing Jia, Kong locates the temple and is fitted by Trapper with a prototype exoskeletal glove to strengthen and heal his frostbitten arm. Unknown to them, an ape follows them and informs the Skar King that the protective barrier leading to the surface portals has been opened. Jia successfully awakens the reborn Mothra. Meanwhile, Godzilla kills Tiamat and absorbs cosmic radiation from her lair, which turns his dorsal plates magenta. Hoping to lure Godzilla to Hollow Earth to assist him, Kong surfaces in Cairo and calls out to him. Despite Kong's attempts to communicate, an enraged Godzilla attacks him, and a brief fight ensues until Mothra intervenes and soothes Godzilla. The three Titans return to the Hollow Earth and engage the Skar King's forces in battle. The Skar King and Shimo manage to use one of the portals to escape to the surface, forcing Godzilla and Kong to chase them to Rio de Janeiro, where Shimo induces a second ice age at the Skar King's command. The factions are evenly matched until Suko arrives with Kong's axe and destroys the control-crystal. Now free, Shimo turns on the Skar King and freezes him solid, allowing Kong to shatter him to pieces. After undoing Shimo's ice age with his atomic breath, Godzilla returns to rest in the Colosseum. Jia alleviates Andrews' concerns by choosing to stay with her. Mothra restores the protective barrier of the Iwi's home and the portals. Kong returns with Shimo and Suko to Hollow Earth where he reunites with his tribe and becomes their new leader.",

They discover that they are being tracked by Gollum, a former bearer of the One Ring. Capturing Gollum, Frodo takes pity and allows him to guide them into Mordor, despite Sam's reservations. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli pursue a band of Uruk-hai to save their companions Merry and Pippin, entering the kingdom of Rohan. The Uruk-hai are ambushed by a group of Rohirrim, allowing Merry and Pippin to escape into Fangorn Forest. Meeting Aragorn's group, Rohirrim leader Éomer explains that he has been exiled with his men by Rohan's king, Théoden, who is under the control of Saruman and his servant Gríma Wormtongue. Éomer believes Merry and Pippin were killed during the raid but leaves the group with two horses. In Fangorn, Aragorn's group encounters Gandalf, who, after dying in battle fighting the Balrog, was resurrected as Gandalf the White to help save Middle-earth. Gandalf leads the trio to Rohan's capital, Edoras, freeing Théoden from Saruman's control. Aragorn prevents Théoden from executing Wormtongue, who flees. Saruman's knowledge reaches Helm's Deep, and Théoden evacuates the citizens there as Saruman sends an army of Uruk-hai to destroy them. Gandalf seeks Éomer and his followers to support their king. Aragorn connects with Théoden's niece, Éowyn, who becomes infatuated with him. When Saruman's Warg-riding Orcs attack the refugees, Aragorn falls and is presumed dead, but he has visions of Arwen before being found by his horse, Brego. He rides to Helm's Deep, witnessing Saruman's army approaching the fortress. In Rivendell, Arwen is told by her father, Elrond, that Aragorn will not return. He reminds her that if she remains in Middle-earth, she will outlive Aragorn by thousands of years, and she reluctantly departs for Valinor. Elrond is contacted by Galadriel of Lothlórien, who convinces him that the Elves should honor their alliance to men, and they dispatch a company of Elves to Helm's Deep. In Fangorn, Merry and Pippin meet Treebeard, an Ent. Convincing Treebeard that they are allies, they are brought to an Ent council, where the Ents decide not to participate in the coming war. Pippin asks Treebeard to take them toward Isengard, where they witness the deforestation caused by Saruman's war effort. Enraged, Treebeard and the Ents storm Isengard, trapping Saruman in his tower. Aragorn arrives at Helm's Deep, warning Théoden of Saruman's army. Théoden prepares for battle despite being outnumbered. A company of Lothlorien Elves arrives to aid Rohan just before the attack. The Uruk-hai breach the outer wall with explosives and kill the Elves' commander, Haldir, in the charge. The defenders retreat to the keep, where Aragorn convinces Théoden for a final charge. At dawn, Gandalf and Éomer arrive with the Rohirrim, turning the tide of battle. The surviving Uruk-hai flee into Fangorn Forest, where the Ents kill them. Gandalf warns of Sauron's retaliation. Gollum leads Frodo and Sam to the Black Gate but recommends they enter Mordor by another route. Frodo and Sam are captured by Rangers led by Faramir, younger brother of the late Boromir. Frodo helps Faramir catch Gollum to save him from being killed by the Rangers. Learning of the One Ring, Faramir takes his captives to Gondor to bring the Ring to his father, Denethor. Passing through the besieged city of Osgiliath, Sam explains to Faramir that Boromir was driven mad by its power. A Nazgûl nearly captures Frodo, but Sam saves him and reminds a disheartened Frodo that they are fighting for the good still left in Middle-earth. Impressed by Frodo's resolve, Faramir releases them.

    "plot": "In the mind of a young girl named Riley Andersen are five personified emotions that influence her actions: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger. Riley's experiences become memories that are stored as colored orbs and are sent into long-term memory each night. The aspects of the five most important \"core memories\" within her personality take the form of five floating islands. Joy acts as the leader and tries to limit Sadness's influence, perceiving her as an unnecessary burden for Riley. At age 11, Riley moves from Minnesota to San Francisco for her father's new job. On Riley's first day at her new school, Sadness retroactively saddens joyous memories, causing Riley to cry in front of her class. This creates Riley's first sad core memory. Joy tries to dispose of the memory using a pneumatic tube but knocks loose the other core memories during a struggle with Sadness, disabling the personality islands. Joy, Sadness, and the core memories are sucked out of Headquarters. In the absence of Joy and Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust try to make happy core memories, but the results are disastrous, distancing Riley from her parents, peers, and hobbies. Without the core memories, Anger causes Riley's personality islands to crumble and fall into the \"Memory Dump\", where things fade to non-existence as they are forgotten. While navigating the vast long-term memory area, Joy and Sadness encounter Bing Bong, Riley's childhood imaginary friend, who suggests riding the \"train of thought\" back to Headquarters. Meanwhile, Anger, intending to restore Riley's happiness, convinces Disgust and Fear that Riley should run away to Minnesota, where her happy memories were formed. Joy, Sadness, and Bing Bong catch the train, but it is derailed when another island collapses. Joy tries to ride a \"recall tube\" back to Headquarters, but the ground below the tube collapses, sending her and Bing Bong plunging into the Memory Dump. Joy discovers a sad memory of Riley losing a hockey game that turned happy when Riley's parents and friends comforted her, and she realizes Sadness's purpose in alerting others when Riley is emotionally overwhelmed and needs help. Joy and Bing Bong try to use his song-fueled wagon rocket to escape the Memory Dump but are unable to ascend due to their combined weight. In the final run, Bing Bong manages to sacrifice himself to save Joy in the memory dump by jumping out of the wagon before fading away. Anger's idea shorts out the console, putting Riley into depression as she boards a bus to Minnesota. Joy reunites with Sadness, and they return to Headquarters. Joy hands control of the console to Sadness, much to the others' shock and confusion. Sadness successfully removes the idea bulb from the console, restarting it and prompting Riley to get off the bus and rush home. Joy, realizing that Riley needs to tell her parents the truth, hands Sadness the core memories, allowing her to make them sad. Riley bursts into tears, telling her parents she misses her old life. Riley's parents comfort her and tell her they also miss Minnesota. Sadness brings Joy over to have her join hands on the console, creating a new core memory that is both happy and sad, and a new island forms, representing Riley's acceptance of her life in San Francisco. A year later, a 12-year-old Riley has adapted to her new home, made new friends, and acquired new hobbies. Inside Headquarters, Riley's emotions admire her new personality islands, powered by new multicolored core memories that contain a mixture of emotions, and are given an expanded console that has enough room for them to work as a team. Although they admit slight concern over a red alarm light marked puberty, they decide that it is not important at the moment.",

    "plot": "In 180 AD, the Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius intends to return home after he leads the Roman army to victory against Germanic tribes near Vindobona. Emperor Marcus Aurelius tells Maximus that his own son, Commodus, is unfit to rule and that he wishes Maximus to succeed him, as regent, to restore the Roman Republic. Angered by this decision, Commodus secretly assassinates his father. Commodus proclaims himself the new emperor and requests loyalty from Maximus, who refuses. Maximus is arrested by Praetorian Guards led by Quintus, who tells him that he and his family will die. Maximus kills his captors and, wounded, rides for his home near Turgalium, where he finds his wife and son murdered. Maximus buries them and collapses from his injuries. He is found by slave traders, who take him to Zuccabar in the Roman province of Mauretania Caesariensis and sell him to the gladiator trainer Proximo. Maximus reluctantly fights in local tournaments, his combat skills helping him win matches and gain popularity. He earns the nickname \"the Spaniard\" and befriends Juba, a gladiator from Carthage, and Hagen, a gladiator from Germania. In Rome, Commodus organizes 150 days of gladiatorial games to commemorate his father and win the approval of the Roman public. Upon hearing this, Proximo reveals to Maximus that he was once a gladiator who was freed by Marcus Aurelius, and advises him to \"win the crowd\" to gain his freedom. Proximo takes his gladiators to fight in Rome's Colosseum. Disguised in a masked helmet, Maximus debuts in the arena as a Carthaginian in a re-enactment of the Battle of Zama. Unexpectedly, he leads his side to victory and wins the crowd's support. Commodus and his young nephew, Lucius, enter the Colosseum to offer their congratulations. Seeing Lucius, Maximus refrains from attacking Commodus, who orders him to reveal his identity. Maximus removes his helmet and declares his intent to seek vengeance. Commodus is compelled by the crowd to let Maximus live. That evening, Maximus is visited by Lucilla, his former lover and Commodus' sister. Distrusting her, Maximus refuses her help. Commodus arranges a duel between Maximus and Tigris of Gaul, an undefeated gladiator. Several tigers are set upon Maximus, but he prevails. At the crowd's desire, Commodus orders Maximus to kill Tigris, but Maximus spares his life in defiance. In response, the crowd chants \"Maximus the Merciful\", angering Commodus. To provoke Maximus, Commodus taunts him about the murder of his family, but Maximus resists the urge to strike him. Increasingly paranoid, Commodus instructs his advisor, Falco, to have every senator followed, and refuses to have Maximus killed for fear he will become a martyr. Maximus discovers from Cicero, his ex-orderly, that his former legions remain loyal to him. He secretly meets with Lucilla and Gracchus, an influential senator. They agree to help Maximus escape Rome to join his legions in Ostia, oust Commodus by force, and hand power back to the Roman Senate. The Praetorians arrest Gracchus. Lucilla meets Maximus at night to arrange his escape; they share a kiss. Commodus becomes suspicious when Lucius innocently hints at the conspiracy. Commodus threatens Lucilla and Lucius, and has the Praetorians attack the gladiators' barracks. Proximo and his men sacrifice themselves to enable Maximus to escape, but Maximus is captured at the rendezvous with Cicero, where the latter is killed. Commodus demands that Lucilla provide him with an heir. He challenges Maximus to a duel in the Colosseum to win back public approval and stabs him before the match to gain an advantage. Despite his injury, Maximus disarms Commodus during the duel. After Quintus and the Praetorians refuse to help him, Commodus unsheathes a hidden knife; Maximus overpowers Commodus and drives the knife into his throat, killing him. Before Maximus succumbs to his wound, he asks for political reforms, the emancipation of his gladiator allies, and the reinstatement of Gracchus as a senator. As he dies, Maximus envisions reuniting with his wife and son in the afterlife. His friends and allies honor him as \"a soldier of Rome\" and carry his body out of the arena. That night, Juba visits the Colosseum and buries figurines of Maximus' wife and son at the spot where Maximus died.",

    "plot": "Garfield is an obese, sedentary tabby cat who lives a pampered lifestyle with his beagle dog sidekick, Odie, and their owner, Jon Arbuckle. One night, while getting a midnight snack, Garfield and Odie are abducted by a Shar Pei named Roland and a Whippet named Nolan, and taken to an abandoned mall, where they are rescued by Vic, Garfield's estranged father, whom he resents for abandoning him in an alley as a kitten. Jinx, a deranged Persian cat with a grudge against Vic, arrives seeking revenge for being left behind during a milk heist at Lactose Farms. She then offers to forgive Vic if he, Garfield, and Odie steal a large quantity of milk as compensation for her imprisonment in the pound, while Roland and Nolan watch closely. The following morning, Jon notices Garfield and Odie's disappearance, and has trouble calling people to help search for them. While freighthopping a Freight train to Lactose Farms, which is through a series of temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the rural area, Vic attempts to bond with Garfield to no avail. The trio reach the farm, which is heavily guarded by an advanced security system, and meet Otto, a Highland bull and the farm's former mascot, who was cast out after a corporation took over, separating him from his cow girlfriend, Ethel. They agree to help get Ethel out of the farm if he helps them break in. While preparing for the heist, Garfield and Vic frequently clash with each other, forcing Odie and Otto to tie them to an oak. During a heated argument, Vic forlornly reveals that he was actually obtaining food for Garfield, but the busboy got in the way, delaying his return. He returned with an anchovy, but found Jon taking care of him in an Italian restaurant he wandered off into. Solemnly accepting Jon as a better care provider, Vic let him adopt Garfield and kept his distance from his son. Understanding the circumstances, Garfield forgives his father. Meanwhile, Roland and Nolan report to Jinx, but she calls the farm's animal control officer, Marge Malone, to frame them for it. Guided by Otto, the trio successfully infiltrates the farm, but Marge intercepts them at the loading dock and captures Garfield and Odie. Vic remorsefully leaves them behind despite his son's pleas, steals the milk truck, and successfully delivers it to Jinx, only to be betrayed and captured by her. Meanwhile, Garfield and Odie end up at the pound, where Garfield meets Vic's old crewmates, who kicked him out for prioritizing Garfield over their plans, and Vic has been keeping distance, watching him, though Garfield doesn't believe their claims. Jon arrives unexpectedly to bail them out and retrieve them. After returning home, Garfield discovers Vic's tally marks on an oak tree, realizing Vic loves him and left him and Odie to protect them from Jinx, knowing she wouldn't forgive him. Garfield, with renewed faith in his father, decides to save him at the mall. There, he and Odie discover Jinx's plan to kill Vic by throwing him off a cable-stayed bridge into the canyon below filled with jagged rocks. Garfield, Odie, Otto and an army of drones arrive to rescue Vic, but they fail and are left at Jinx's mercy. However, witnessing Vic's love for his son, Roland and Nolan turn on Jinx, who in response pushes them off the train and into the canyon, only to be knocked off herself. Otto uses a rope to catch everyone, landing them safely on a net set up by Odie, and apprehending Jinx. They return to the farm via a milk truck, trading Jinx to Marge for Ethel's release and reuniting her with Otto. The reformed Roland and Nolan work as guard dogs for Marge, while Jinx serves community service for her crimes. Upon returning home, Garfield finally reconciles with Vic, who moves in with the trio and officially becomes a part of his son's life.",

After being dishonorably discharged from the Canadian special forces, Wade works as a freelance mercenary until he meets a sex worker named Vanessa. They become romantically involved, and a year later, she accepts his marriage proposal. Wade is later diagnosed with terminal cancer and is approached by a mysterious recruiter who offers him an experimental treatment that will heal his cancer. Wade leaves Vanessa so she will not have to watch him die. He is taken to a laboratory run by Ajax and Angel Dust, who injects him with a serum designed to awaken latent mutant genes in his body. They subject Wade to days of torture to trigger any mutation but to no avail. When Wade discovers Ajax's real name is Francis and mocks him for it, Ajax leaves Wade in a hypobaric chamber that periodically takes him to the verge of asphyxiation over a weekend. This activates a regenerative healing factor that counteracts Wade's cancer but leaves him severely disfigured with burn-like tumors all over his body. He escapes from the chamber and attacks Ajax but relents when told his condition can be cured. In the chaos, Ajax subdues Wade and leaves him for dead. Wade survives due to his new healing factor and seeks out Vanessa but does not reveal that he is alive out of fear that she will shun him because of his new scarred appearance. After consulting with his best friend Weasel, Wade decides to hunt down Ajax for the cure. He becomes a vigilante, adopting the name \"Deadpool\" (from Weasel picking him in a dead pool), and moves into the home of an elderly blind woman named Al. Throughout the following year, he questions and kills many of Ajax's associates until one, the recruiter, reveals Ajax's whereabouts. This information allows Wade to enact the ambush. He kills all of Ajax's henchmen, subdues Ajax, and demands the cure, but the X-Men Colossus and his trainee Negasonic Teenage Warhead interrupt him. Colossus attempts to convince Wade to mend his ways and join the X-Men, but Wade turns him down. Taking advantage of this distraction, Ajax escapes and regroups with Angel Dust. They then head to Weasel's bar, where Ajax hears of Vanessa. Ajax kidnaps Vanessa and takes her to a decommissioned Helicarrier in a scrapyard. In response, Wade convinces Colossus and Negasonic to help him get her back. They battle Angel Dust and a group of Ajax's men while Wade fights his way to Ajax. During the battle, Negasonic accidentally destroys the supports keeping the Helicarrier stable.

He reveals that there is no cure, and despite Colossus's pleas, Wade kills Ajax. Vanessa angrily berates Wade for leaving her but reconciles with him after she sees his disfigured face and learns the reason why he never came back to her. In a post-credits scene, Wade imitates the post-credits scene of Ferris Bueller's Day Off, stating they only have enough money left to announce that Cable will show up in the sequel and making casting suggestions for the character.",

King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi's newborn son, Simba, is presented to the gathered animals by Rafiki, the mandrill who serves as the kingdom's shaman and advisor. Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, covets the throne and plots to eliminate Mufasa and Simba so that he may become king. When Simba grows into a young cub, Mufasa shows him the Pride Lands and forbids him from exploring beyond its borders. Mufasa explains to Simba the responsibilities of kingship and the \"circle of life,\" which connects all living things. Scar manipulates Simba into exploring an elephants' graveyard beyond the Pride Lands. There, Simba and his best friend, Nala, are chased by three spotted hyenas named Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed. Mufasa is alerted by his majordomo, the hornbill Zazu, and rescues the cubs. Though disappointed in Simba for disobeying him and endangering himself and Nala, Mufasa forgives him. He explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba. Scar visits the hyenas and convinces them to help him kill Mufasa and Simba in exchange for hunting rights in the Pride Lands. Scar sets a trap for Simba and Mufasa. He lures Simba into a gorge and signals the hyenas to drive a large herd of wildebeest into a stampede to trample him. Scar alerts Mufasa, who saves Simba and tries to escape the gorge; he begs Scar for help, but Scar betrays him by throwing him into the stampede to his death. Scar then deceives Simba into believing that Mufasa's death was his fault and tells him to leave the kingdom and never return. He orders the hyenas to kill Simba, but Simba escapes. Unaware of Simba's survival, Scar tells the pride that the stampede killed both Mufasa and Simba, and steps forward as the new king, allowing the hyenas into the Pride Lands. Simba collapses in a desert but is rescued by two outcasts, a meerkat and a warthog named Timon and Pumbaa. Simba grows up with his two new friends in their oasis, living a carefree life under their motto \"hakuna matata\" (\"no worries\" in Swahili). Years later, an adult Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who is revealed to be Nala. Simba and Nala fall in love, and she urges him to return home, telling him that the Pride Lands have become drought-stricken under Scar's reign. Still feeling guilty over Mufasa's death, Simba refuses and leaves angrily. He encounters Rafiki, who tells Simba that Mufasa’s spirit lives on in him. Simba is visited by the spirit of Mufasa in the night sky, who tells him that he must take his place as king. After Rafiki advises him to learn from the past instead of running from it, Simba decides to return to the Pride Lands. Aided by his friends, Simba sneaks past the hyenas at Pride Rock and confronts Scar, who shames Simba over his supposed role in Mufasa’s death. Scar then reveals to Simba that he killed Mufasa. Enraged, Simba retaliates and forces Scar to confess the truth to the pride. A battle ensues between Simba and his allies and the hyenas. Scar attempts to escape but is cornered by Simba at a ledge near the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and attempts to deceive Simba by blaming his actions on the hyenas. Simba spares Scar's life but orders him to leave the Pride Lands forever. Scar refuses and attacks Simba. Following a brief battle, Simba throws Scar off the ledge. Scar survives the fall, but the hyenas, who overheard him betraying them, attack and maul him to death. With Scar and the hyenas gone, Simba takes his place as king, and Nala becomes his queen. With the Pride Lands restored, Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the assembled animals, thus continuing the circle of life.",

During the reception, his partner, Detective Marcus Burnett, suffers a heart attack and goes into a coma, where he experiences a vision of the late Captain Conrad Howard telling him it is not his time. When Marcus wakes up, he believes he cannot die. A group of ruthless operatives led by a well-spoken American force a Miami-based money launderer to transfer a large amount of money to Captain Howard's account and to retroactively create an extensive transaction history. Soon after, news channels are awash with reports on Captain Howard's cartel involvement. With his legacy being posthumously tarnished, Mike and Marcus are determined to prove his innocence with the help of Captain Rita Secada and her new boyfriend, mayoral candidate Adam Lockwood. Mike and Marcus visit Mike's son, Armando Aretas, who is incarcerated for Howard's murder. Armando tells them that Howard was not corrupt but knew who was, so the corrupted officials hired him and his mother to kill Howard because he was close to exposing the corruption and offers to help them identify the person responsible for Howard's murder. When the conspirators try to access Captain Howard's computer, a fail-safe, pre-recorded video is sent to Mike and Marcus, warning them of corruption within federal and state law enforcement. Howard uses the phrase \"Coke bottle\" as a code phrase, and it is revealed that he gave information to their former hacker colleague Fletcher. They go to Fletcher's club to retrieve the \"files\", a QR code hidden in wall art that unlocks a second video from Captain Howard. However, assassins hired by the conspirators tail them to the club and kill Fletcher. Meanwhile, Armando is attacked by several prisoners, paid to silence him, but he fends them off. Mike and Marcus arrange for Armando to be air-lifted to a more secure location in Miami. However, the conspirators sneak on board and kill the pilot and guards, causing the helicopter to crash. Mike, Marcus, and Armando survive but are branded as fugitives by the conspirators. When the conspirators put out a bounty, the three are hunted by both law enforcement and opportunistic criminals. Conrad's daughter, U.S. Marshal Judy Howard, swears vengeance on Armando for killing her father. With the assistance of AMMO (Advanced Miami Metro Operations) members Dorn and Kelly, Mike and Marcus uncover the video clues behind the murder and setup. Armando identifies the man who hired him to kill Captain Howard as James McGrath, a former Army Ranger assigned to Drug Enforcement Administration Intelligence in South America. While undercover, McGrath got captured by the cartel and was tortured until he gave up his associates and has been working with them ever since. McGrath orchestrates the kidnapping of Christine and Callie, Judy's daughter. He then sends his men to get Marcus' family, but Marcus' Marine son-in-law, Reggie, single-handedly kills all of them. Rita, Dorn, and Kelly apprehend Lockwood after learning McGrath works for him. Using Lockwood as bait, the team engages in a fierce gunfight with McGrath's men at a former alligator-themed amusement park to rescue Christine and Callie. Later on, during the fight, Lockwood attempts to betray the team by wounding Dorn and Kelly before fleeing, but Rita shoots down the plane and stops him. Refusing to shoot him, she kicks him into the water, causing him to be devoured by an alligator. Mike confronts McGrath, who holds both Christine and Marcus hostage at gunpoint. McGrath then presents Mike with an impossible choice: pick Christine or Marcus to die. Mike, alluding to Marcus' newfound belief that he \"cannot die\", shoots Marcus in his bulletproof vest. The chaos allows Christine and Marcus to break free before Mike shoots McGrath dead. Amidst the chaos, Judy finds Armando and Callie. Judy prepares to kill Armando, but Callie tells her mother that he saved her life. Begrudgingly grateful for his heroic act, Judy shows mercy to Armando and allows him to escape. Afterward, Mike, Marcus, and Howard are cleared of all charges, and the corruption is exposed. Mike and Marcus' families then celebrate by having a picnic in the park, with Mike and Marcus allowing Reggie to cook on a public grill due to him saving their family.",

Edward's family hosts a birthday reception for Bella at their home. After she receives a paper cut and is almost attacked by a bloodthirsty Jasper Cullen, Edward realizes he has put her life in danger by putting her amidst vampires. After rumors start spreading of Carlisle's age and appearance, he ends their relationship and the Cullens leave town. Bella is left severely depressed and isolates herself for months, during which she has night terrors, enough to push her father, Charlie, to his breaking point where he considered relocating Bella to her mother's place. She accepts a ride from a biker and the dangerous encounter reminds her of a near-assault where Edward rescued her. She realizes that dangerous activities cause her to hallucinate his image. Her Quileute friend Jacob Black supports her during her slump. While attending a movie with Bella, Jacob abruptly shows signs of pain and leaves. He cuts his long hair and now exhibits the same Quileute tattoo as leader Sam and the other tribe members. He revealed that he knew the Cullens were vampires and inexplicably tells Bella to stay away. When Bella hikes to the meadow that she and Edward often visit, she is confronted by Laurent seeking to avenge the Cullens' past killing of James. A wolf pack saves her, killing Laurent, and Bella discovers that Jacob and the other tribe members are werewolves, with Jacob only recently gaining this shapeshifting ability. Their age-old enemies are vampires, though a treaty exists between the Cullens and the tribe. Edward believes that Bella has killed herself after his clairvoyant adoptive sister Alice has a vision of her jumping off a seaside cliff and when he phones her house, Jacob answers saying her father is out preparing a funeral. Distraught, Edward travels to Italy to ask the vampire council, the Volturi, to end his life. When they refuse, he plans to force their hand by exposing himself as a vampire to humans during a large festival. Alice and Bella arrive in time to prevent Edward from doing so. Overjoyed that Bella is alive, he confesses that he left Forks to protect her but promises never to leave her again. Edward defends Bella from the Volturi, who do not allow humans to know about their vampire society. As the Volturi are about to kill Edward, Bella asks that they kill her instead. Impressed by a human's willingness to sacrifice her life for a vampire's, they allow her the choice to be transformed into a vampire instead of dying, convinced when Alice shares a future vision of Bella as a vampire. After returning to Forks, Bella asks the Cullens to vote on her becoming a vampire. Despite Edward's protestations, everyone except Rosalie votes yes. Charlie is upset with her but allows Edward to be with her and grounds her for leaving with no explanation. Bella tells Edward she wants him to be the one to turn her into a vampire. Jacob confronts the pair, reminding Edward that the years-old treaty with Quileute will be broken if any Cullen bites a human, but Bella tells him it is her choice, not the Cullens'. Edward agrees to let her transform into a vampire only if she will marry him, leading to the next movie.",

Peter awakens on top of a building, discovering that the symbiote has turned his suit black and enhanced his powers, but it also heightens his aggression. Peter battles Marko in a subway. Finding that water weakens him, Peter opens a pipe, turning Marko into mud and washing him away. Peter's new attitude alienates Mary Jane, who kisses Harry and departs regretfully. A hallucination of his father prompts Harry to recover from amnesia and force Mary Jane to break up with Peter. Later, Harry tells Peter that Mary Jane is dating him. Under the symbiote's influence, Peter fights Harry, spitefully claiming his father never loved him. As Peter leaves, Harry throws a pumpkin bomb, which Peter deflects, disfiguring Harry's face. At the Daily Bugle, Peter exposes rival photographer Eddie Brock, whose fake photos incriminate Spider-Man. Publisher J. Jonah Jameson, outraged at Brock's false photo and having to print a retraction, fires Brock and promotes Peter to staff photographer. Later, Peter brings Gwen to a jazz club where Mary Jane now works, in an attempt to make her jealous. Upon realizing Peter's true intentions, Gwen apologizes to Mary Jane and leaves. After assaulting the bouncers and accidentally hitting Mary Jane, Peter realizes that the symbiote is corrupting him. Retreating to a church's bell tower and discovering that the sounds of clanging metal weaken the creature, Peter removes the symbiote. Seeing the event from the pews below, Brock becomes the symbiote's new host and turns into Venom. Brock locates a still-living Marko and convinces him to join forces to kill Spider-Man. Brock abducts Mary Jane and holds her captive from a web at a construction site, intending to kill her in revenge for Peter ruining him, while Marko keeps the police at bay. After a now-scarred Harry declines to help Peter, Harry's butler reveals that Norman's death was not Spider-Man's fault. While Brock and Marko pin Peter down, Harry arrives to help Peter and save Mary Jane. Brock attempts to impale Peter with Harry's glider, but Harry jumps in and is impaled instead. While remembering the symbiote's weakness, Peter assembles a perimeter of metal pipes to create a sonic attack, weakening it and allowing Peter to separate Brock from the symbiote. Peter activates a pumpkin bomb and throws it at the hostless symbiote. Having become addicted to its influence, Brock tries saving the symbiote, but both are killed. Marko explains that Ben's death was an accident that has haunted him, and that everything he has done was to help his daughter. Peter forgives Marko, allowing him to escape. Harry reconciles with Peter before he dies from his injuries. After Harry's funeral, Peter visits Mary Jane at the jazz club, where they reconcile and share a dance.",

    "plot": "Former Oscorp scientist and businessman Richard Parker records a video message to explain his disappearance. He and his wife Mary flee aboard a private jet that is soon hijacked by an assassin and crashed, killing the couple. In the present, one year after his battle with Curt Connors, Richard and Mary's son, Peter, continues to fight crime as Spider-Man and apprehends Russian criminal Aleksei Sytsevich. Due to Peter's reservations about his relationship with his girlfriend Gwen Stacy since making a vow to her late father to avoid her, Gwen ends their relationship after their high school graduation. A few months later, Peter's childhood friend, Harry Osborn, returns home to see his terminally ill father, Norman Osborn, CEO of Oscorp. He explains that his illness is genetic and Harry is at the age where it first develops before dying as his son succeeds him. While working in an Oscorp laboratory, mild-mannered electrical engineer Max Dillon accidentally electrocutes himself and falls into a tank of genetically engineered electric eels which mutate him into an electrokinetic being. Gwen tells Peter that she may move to England if she earns a scholarship to Oxford University. Unaware of the extent of his power, Max wanders into Times Square, inadvertently causes a power outage and is stopped by Spider-Man as he is then taken to the Ravencroft Institute. The first symptoms of Harry's illness begin showing and he uses information his father gave him to deduce that Spider-Man's blood could save him. He asks Peter, who has been selling photos of Spider-Man to the Daily Bugle, to aid him in finding Spider-Man. Peter is unsure of what effects the transfusion would have but knows it could cause a mutation similar to Connors. He later refuses Harry as Spider-Man, enraging him. Oscorp vice president Donald Menken frames Harry for covering up Max's accident and usurps him. Harry offers to liberate Max, who now calls himself \"Electro\", in exchange for getting Harry back inside the Oscorp building; Max agrees. Upon returning to Oscorp, Harry finds venom from the now-destroyed genetically altered spiders. However, after he forces Menken to inject him with the venom, it accelerates his illness and turns him into a goblin-like being, with the built-in emergency protocol in an armored suit restoring his health. By researching subway tokens hidden in his father's belongings, Peter finds Richard's video message in his secret lab in an abandoned subway station. It reveals he had to flee because he refused to cooperate with Norman's plans to make biogenetic weapons with his research. Richard used his own DNA when he made the spiders, so Oscorp cannot recreate them without his blood. When Gwen is offered the scholarship, Peter professes his love for her and they agree to go to England together. When Max causes another power outage, Peter and Gwen restore power and overload Max's body, killing him. The mutated Harry arrives equipped with weaponry, whereupon he discovers Peter's identity and swears revenge for refusing the blood transfusion, taking Gwen to the top of a clock tower and dropping her. Peter subdues Harry but is unable to save Gwen, who falls to her death. Guilt-ridden and depressed, Peter ends his career as Spider-Man. Five months later, Harry is coping with the aftereffects of his transformation while incarcerated at Ravencroft. His associate, Gustav Fiers, visits him and discusses forming a team. Harry orders Fiers to start with Sytsevich, whom he broke out of prison. Equipped with an electromechanical suit of armor, Sytsevich dubs himself \"The Rhino\" and rampages through the streets. Peter, re-inspired after watching Gwen's graduation speech, returns to confront him as Spider-Man.",

    "plot": "Tony Stark, who has inherited the defense contractor Stark Industries from his late father Howard Stark, tours in war-torn Afghanistan with his best friend and military liaison, James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes, to demonstrate the new \"Jericho\" missile. After the demonstration, his convoy is ambushed by a terrorist group, the Ten Rings, and Stark is gravely wounded by a missile used by the attackers—one of his company's own. He is captured and imprisoned in a cave by the Ten Rings. Yinsen, a fellow captive and doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep the shrapnel shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him. Ten Rings leader Raza offers Stark freedom in exchange for building a Jericho missile for the group, but he and Yinsen believe that Raza will not keep his word. Stark and Yinsen secretly build a small, powerful electric generator called an arc reactor to power Stark's electromagnet and construct a prototype armored suit to aid in their escape. Although they keep the suit hidden, the Ten Rings discover their intentions and attack the workshop. Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit powers up. The armored Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' weapons and flies away, crashing in the desert and destroying the suit. After being rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home and announces that his company will cease manufacturing weapons. Obadiah Stane, his father's old partner and the company's manager, advises Stark that this will bankrupt Stark Industries and ruin his father's legacy. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his improvised armor suit as well as a more powerful arc reactor for it and his chest after testing a prototype. Personal assistant Pepper Potts places the original reactor inside a small glass showcase. Though Stane requests details, a suspicious Stark decides to keep his work to himself. At a charity event, reporter Christine Everhart informs Stark that his company's weapons were recently delivered to the Ten Rings and are being used to attack Yinsen's home village. Stark dons his new armor and flies to Afghanistan, where he fends off the terrorists and saves the villagers. While flying home, Stark is intercepted by the Air Force. He reveals his secret identity to Rhodes over the phone to end the attack. Meanwhile, the Ten Rings gather the pieces of Stark's prototype suit and meet with Stane, who has been trafficking arms to the Ten Rings and has staged a coup to replace Stark as Stark Industries' CEO by hiring the Ten Rings to kill him. He subdues Raza and has him and the rest of the group killed. Stane has a massive new armor suit reverse-engineered from the wreckage. Seeking to track his company's illegal shipments, Stark sends Potts to hack into its database. She discovers that Stane hired the Ten Rings to kill Stark, but the group altered their plans when they realized they had a direct route to Stark's weapons. Potts meets with Agent Phil Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D., an intelligence agency, to inform him of Stane's activities. Stane's scientists are unable to replicate Stark's miniaturized arc reactor, so Stane enters Stark's home, stuns Stark, and steals the one from his chest. Stark manages to replace it with his original reactor. Potts and several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents attempt to arrest Stane, but he dons his suit and overpowers them. Stark fights Stane but is outmatched without his new reactor to run his suit at full capacity. The fight carries Stark and Stane to the top of the Stark Industries building, where Stark instructs Potts to overload the large arc reactor powering the building. This unleashes a massive electrical surge that causes Stane to fall into the reactor and he is killed in the explosion. The next day, at a press conference, Stark publicly admits to being the superhero the press has dubbed \"Iron Man\". In a post-credits scene, S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury visits Stark at his home, telling him that he has become part of a \"bigger universe\", and that he wants to discuss the \"Avenger Initiative\".",

    "plot": "A man named Boyce directly addresses the viewer, warning them that what they're about to see is not a happy fairytale. Earth has become an uncivilized, dystopian wasteland called the Lost Lands. In a society ruled by Overlord, order is forcibly maintained by the Church. Gray Alys, a witch, is being hanged, on the orders of The Enforcer and her followers from the Church. Gray Alys uses her powers to trick a man into helping her escape, but The Enforcer kills him for it and leads a group of men in pursuit of Alys. Boyce is alone and unscarred in the Lost Lands, he walks through a tunnel and anticipates an ambush. He uses a two-headed snake as a weapon before shooting the remaining enemies and continuing his journey. Gray Alys finds refuge with a blind old woman. The Queen, wife of The Overlord, and the head of the Overwatch, Jerais, visit her. The Queen seeks Gray Alys' assistance, invoking a pre-existing agreement that Alys does not refuse requests from anyone. The Queen needs a werewolf's power by next week's full moon; Gray Alys is tasked with killing the beast and bringing its power to the Queen. Jerais secretly sabotages the Queen's endeavor, believing its failure is ultimately in her best interest. Gray Alys uses her powers to find a shapeshifter by entering its mind. The Queen hates the ailing Overlord, who is on the verge of death. Alys seeks out Boyce in a pub to enlist his help in finding a shapeshifter. The creature is known as Sardor, meaning \"Grey Wolf\". The Enforcer is working with The Patriarch, who is secretly plotting to overthrow The Overlord and the Queen, despite serving The Overlord. The Patriarch orders The Enforcer and acolytes to capture Gray Alys, extract a confession, and then execute her. Gray Alys and Boyce began their expedition into the Lost Lands, where Boyce encounters his old friends Ross and Mara. Boyce and Mara have sex before Boyce continues his quest with Gray Alys. The Enforcer captures and tortures Ross and Mara, seeking information about Gray Alys and Boyce. The group was supposed to go to Skull River, but they murder Ross and kidnap Mara instead. Boyce and his friend search for Cyrus, but discover he has been hanged by the Church. Boyce and Gray Alys locate The Enforcer and her goons, but they've shielded their eyes to block Gray Alys' powers. The Enforcer kills Mara to further torment Boyce. He and Gray Alys are attacked, leading to a gunfight and a chase to an air tram where most of the goons are thrown to their deaths. The Enforcer orders the cable cut, and shoots Boyce, but Gray Alys uses her powers through a sniper lens to save him and escape. Gray Alys and Boyce face ghoul-like monsters while traveling. Trapped in a ring of fire for protection, the group faces a monster leader who knows Gray Alys and disapproves of her return. She uses illusion magic to make the monsters believe that they are on fire. She warns Boyce that she's dangerous and untrustworthy. The Queen kills The Overlord, disclosing she's carrying Boyce's baby. The Patriarch announces the Overlord's death but secretly continues plotting the Queen's assassination. The Enforcer attacks Gray Alys on a train with her goons. She escapes through the tunnels and heads towards the end of the broken train tracks, which are high up. Gray Alys is rescued by Boyce, but The Enforcer and her crew die when the train crashes and explodes. Jerais kills the Patriarch to protect the Queen and then begins an affair with her. Under the light of the full moon, Gray Alys and Boyce reach Skull River. Boyce is revealed to be the shapeshifter impersonating Sardor. Under the moonlight, he turns into a wolf.

Gray Alys kills Boyce under the light of the moon, skins the body, and then buries the remains. Gray Alys brings Boyce's pelt to The Queen. Jerais claims Alys failed him, but she tells him that she gave him what he truly desired, which was the queen. The Queen knew all along that Boyce is a shapeshifter hence the reason why she wanted to become one, enraged, she accused Jerais of plotting to kill Boyce and she kills him. The Lost Lands are in rebellion after the Overlord's death and the Church's fall. The Queen flees as Boyce's fur burns under the sun. Boyce rises from his grave, resurrected, and seeks out Gray Alys with the intention of killing her. She believed in his return from the dead as strongly as she believed in the coming rebellion.

    "plot": "In the New England beach town of Amity Island, a young woman goes for a late-night ocean swim. An unseen force attacks and pulls her underwater. Her partial remains are found washed up on the beach the next morning. After the coroner concludes it was a shark attack, Amity police chief Martin Brody plans to close the beaches. Mayor Larry Vaughn persuades him to reconsider, fearing the town's summer economy will suffer. The coroner, apparently under pressure, now concurs with the mayor's theory that it was a boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until young Alex Kintner is killed at a crowded beach. A $3,000 bounty is placed on the shark, causing an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Quint, an eccentric local shark hunter, offers his services for $10,000. Consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines the girl's remains, confirming she was killed by an unusually large shark. When local fishermen catch a tiger shark, Vaughn declares the beaches safe. A skeptical Hooper dissects the shark and, finding no human remains inside its stomach, concludes the killer shark is still active. While searching the night waters in Hooper's boat, Hooper and Brody find the half-sunken boat of Ben Gardner, a local fisherman. Hooper dons a scuba suit and goes underwater to check the boat's hull and finds a large shark tooth embedded into it. He drops the tooth after encountering Gardner's severed head. Vaughn dismisses Brody and Hooper's assertions that a great white shark caused the deaths and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only increased safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists pack the beaches. The shark enters a nearby lagoon, killing a boater and nearly killing Brody's son, Michael, who is hospitalized with shock. Brody then convinces a guilt-ridden Vaughn to hire Quint. Despite initial tension between Quint and Hooper, and Brody's fear of the ocean, the three head out to sea on Quint's boat, the Orca, to hunt for the shark. As Brody lays down a chum line, the shark suddenly appears behind the boat. Quint, estimating it is 25 feet (7.6 m) long and weighs 3 tonnes (3.0 long tons; 3.3 short tons), harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but the shark pulls it underwater and disappears. At nightfall, Quint and Hooper drunkenly exchange stories about their assorted body scars. One of Quint's is a removed tattoo; he reveals that during World War II, he survived the sinking of the USS Indianapolis, during which sharks killed many U.S. sailors. The shark returns, ramming the boat's hull and disabling the power. The men work through the night, repairing the engine. In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint, obsessed with killing the shark without outside assistance, smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons the shark with another barrel. The line is tied to the stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backward, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment. As Quint is about to sever the line to save the boat's transom, the cleats break off. The barrels stay attached to the shark. To Brody's relief, Quint speeds the Orca toward shore to draw the shark into shallower waters, but the damaged engine fails. As the boat takes on water, the trio attempt a riskier approach. Hooper suits up and enters a shark-proof cage, intending to lethally inject the shark with strychnine via a hypodermic spear. The shark attacks the cage, causing Hooper to drop the spear. While the shark destroys the cage, Hooper escapes to the ocean bottom. The shark leaps onto the boat's stern, subsequently devouring Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody thrusts a scuba tank into the shark's mouth and, climbing onto the crow's nest, shoots the tank with a rifle. The resulting explosion kills the shark. Hooper resurfaces and he and Brody paddle back to shore, clinging to the remaining barrels.",

    "plot": "Sixty-five million years ago, an alien race known as the \"Creators\" used devices called Seeds to cover Earth with a metallic alloy called \"Transformium\", supposedly wiping out the dinosaurs in the process. In the present day, geologist Darcy Tirrel excavates the Transformium for K.S.I. Industries, using it to build Transformer drones. In the years after the Battle of Chicago, humans view Transformers as hostile and terminate all joint operations with them including NEST. Though the public believes that the Autobots were granted sanctuary, they are hunted down by a rogue CIA black ops division, Cemetery Wind, led by opportunistic, rogue intelligence operative Harold Attinger, who believes that all Transformers are dangerous and must be destroyed. Lockdown, a Cybertronian assassin and bounty hunter working for the Creators, is tasked to find Optimus Prime. In exchange, he gives Attinger a Seed if his division manages to capture Optimus. Lockdown locates and kills Ratchet when he refuses to give up Optimus's location. Optimus, badly damaged in Mexico City, hides in Texas and is discovered by Cade Yeager, a financially struggling inventor and a single father. While his teenage daughter Tessa and business partner Lucas Flannery encourage him to turn Optimus over to the authorities, Cade instead fixes Optimus. Hoping to collect an advertised reward, Lucas alerts the authorities, and James Savoy, Attinger's field commanding operative, attacks the Yeager farm, but Optimus, and Tessa's secret boyfriend, Irish rally car driver Shane Dyson, rescue the family. During the pursuit, Lucas is killed by one of Lockdown's grenades. Optimus summons the surviving Autobots – Bumblebee, Hound, Drift, and Crosshairs. Using a stolen CIA drone, Cade discovers K.S.I.'s involvement with Cemetery Wind and the attacks on the Autobots. Infiltrating K.S.I.'s headquarters in Chicago, Cade discovers the dead Autobots and Decepticons being melted down to make Transformer drones. The K.S.I. CEO, Joshua Joyce, is in league with Attinger to revolutionize global defenses and improve human society using the Seed to make more Transformium. He has also used the captured Brains and Megatron's head to create prototype Transformer soldiers, Galvatron and Stinger. The Autobots storm the building and destroy the laboratory, but they soon leave after Joshua declares that they don't need them anymore. Attinger forces Joshua to deploy Galvatron and Stinger to capture the Autobots. During the battle, Galvatron's behavior becomes erratic. As Galvatron battles Optimus, he gets autonomously freed from control. Suddenly, Lockdown arrives and abducts both Optimus and Tessa while Galvatron retreats. While Lockdown's large prison spacecraft hovers over Chicago to hand over the Seed, Cade, Shane, and the Autobots sneak on board to rescue Optimus and Tessa. They hijack a smaller ship, containing other Transformers called the Dinobots, just before Lockdown leaves Earth. The Autobots learn that Galvatron is Megatron reincarnated, plotting to use the Seed and the Transformer drones to conquer the world and that KSI plans to use the Seed in the Mongolian desert to create vast amounts of usable Transformium. Cade informs Joshua, who agrees to hand over the Seed with help from Darcy and his Chinese business associate Su Yueming. Galvatron reactivates himself and takes control of the drones, organizing them into a new Decepticon army. A battle follows in Hong Kong between the Autobots, Cemetery Wind, and the Decepticons. During the fight, Cade sends Savoy plummeting to his death while Optimus frees the Dinobots and wins their allegiance through trial by combat, becoming essential to the Autobots' victory. Lockdown returns to recapture Optimus and the Dinobots, using a large magnet to cause destruction. After disabling the magnet, Optimus fights Lockdown. In the ensuing duel, Optimus kills Attinger to save Cade, but the distraction allows Lockdown to pin Optimus down with his sword. Cade ends up fighting Lockdown one-on-one while Tessa and Shane use a tow truck to free Optimus, who kills Lockdown before destroying the remaining Decepticons with Lockdown's grenade. Galvatron retreats, vowing to return. Optimus asks the Autobots to protect the Yeagers while Joshua offers to help them build a new home, before flying away into space with the Seed, sending a message to the Creators that he is coming for them.",

    "plot": "In a period of galactic civil war, Rebel Alliance spies have stolen blueprints to the Death Star, a colossal space station built by the Galactic Empire that is capable of destroying entire planets. Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan, secretly a rebel leader, has obtained the schematics, but her ship is intercepted and boarded by Imperial forces under the command of Darth Vader. Leia is taken prisoner, but the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO escape with the plans, crashing on the nearby desert planet of Tatooine. Darth Vader learns of this and orders the Imperials to pursue the droids. The droids are captured by Jawa traders, who sell them to the moisture farmers Owen and Beru Lars and their nephew, Luke Skywalker. While Luke is cleaning R2-D2, he discovers a recording of Leia requesting help from a former ally named Obi-Wan Kenobi. R2-D2 goes missing, and while searching for him, Luke is attacked by Sand People. He is rescued by the elderly hermit Ben Kenobi, who soon reveals himself as Obi-Wan. He tells Luke about his past as one of the Jedi Knights, former peacekeepers of the Galactic Republic, who drew mystical abilities from the Force but were exterminated when the Republic was superseded by the Empire. Luke learns that his father, also a Jedi, fought alongside Obi-Wan during the Clone Wars until Vader, Obi-Wan's former pupil, turned to the dark side of the Force and murdered him. Obi-Wan gives Luke his father's lightsaber, the signature weapon of the Jedi. R2-D2 plays Leia's full message, in which she begs Obi-Wan to take the Death Star plans to Alderaan and give them to her father, a fellow veteran, for analysis. Luke initially declines Obi-Wan's offer to accompany him to Alderaan and learn the ways of the Force. Still, he is left with no choice after Imperial stormtroopers murder his family and destroy his home while searching for the droids. Seeking a way off the planet, Luke and Obi-Wan travel with the droids to the city of Mos Eisley and hire the smuggler Han Solo and his Wookiee partner Chewbacca, pilots of the starship Millennium Falcon. Before the Falcon reaches Alderaan, the Death Star commander Grand Moff Tarkin has the planet obliterated by the station's superlaser. En route to Alderaan aboard the Falcon, Obi-Wan begins Luke's training in the use of the Force, but the old Jedi is overwhelmed by emotion when the planet is destroyed and millions of people are killed. Upon arrival, the Falcon is captured by the Death Star's tractor beam, but the passengers avoid detection and infiltrate the station. As Obi-Wan leaves to deactivate the tractor beam, Luke persuades Han and Chewbacca to help him rescue Leia, who is scheduled for execution after refusing to reveal the location of the rebel base. After disabling the tractor beam, Obi-Wan sacrifices himself in a lightsaber duel against Vader, which allows the rest of the group to escape. Using a tracking device placed on the Falcon, the Empire locates the rebel base on the moon Yavin 4. Analysis of the Death Star schematics reveals a weakness in a small exhaust port leading directly to the station's reactor. Luke joins the Rebellion's X-wing squadron in a desperate attack against the Death Star, while Han and Chewbacca leave to pay off a debt to the crime lord Jabba the Hutt. In the ensuing battle, Vader leads a squadron of TIE fighters and destroys several rebel ships, while Tarkin orders the Death Star to maneuver into position to destroy Yavin 4. Han and Chewbacca unexpectedly return in the Falcon, knocking Vader's ship off course before he can shoot Luke down. Guided by the voice of Obi-Wan's spirit, Luke uses the Force to aim his torpedoes into the exhaust port, causing the Death Star to explode moments before it can fire on the rebel base. Vader regains control of his ship, sees the destruction of the Death Star, and flees into deep space. Leia awards Luke and Han medals for their heroism in a triumphant ceremony.",

    "plot": "The Sevastopol, a next-generation Russian stealth submarine on its inaugural mission, 74 days after traveling 25,000 nautical miles, passing through all the navies of the world without being detected, activates an advanced active learning defense system using a two-piece cruciform key. The AI, designated \"the Entity\", becomes sentient and goes rogue after deceiving the submarine crew into thinking an enemy submarine was nearby and attacking themselves with a torpedo, killing all aboard and sinking the Sevastopol in the Bering Sea. World powers compete to obtain the cruciform key in hopes of controlling the Entity. IMF agent Ethan Hunt travels to the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert and retrieves one piece of the key from disavowed MI6 agent Ilsa Faust, faking her death to shield her from a bounty. In Washington, D.C., Ethan infiltrates a U.S. Intelligence Community briefing for Director of National Intelligence Denlinger, where CIA Director Eugene Kittridge explains that the Entity can manipulate cyberspace to control global defense intelligence and financial networks. Ethan reveals himself and forces him to admit to placing the bounty on Ilsa, then escapes, determined to destroy the Entity. Ethan and his IMF teammates Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell travel to Abu Dhabi International Airport to intercept the second piece of the key. It is revealed to be a fake, although Ethan encounters Grace, a skilled thief who steals the first piece of the key from him, while Luther and Benji disarm a hoax nuclear device. Ethan is pursued by CIA agents but spots his old enemy Gabriel, an Entity liaison with ties to his pre-IMF past, and aborts the mission, scattering the team. Grace escapes to Rome and is apprehended, but Ethan rescues her from local authorities, the US agents, and an Entity operative named Paris. Grace escapes again, while Ethan rejoins Luther, Benji, and Ilsa. Ethan and Ilsa follow Grace to Venice and infiltrate a party held by arms dealer Alanna Mitsopolis at Doge's Palace. In possession of the second piece of the key, Alanna hired Grace to steal the first, and will sell the completed key to her buyer the next day on the Orient Express. Gabriel proclaims that he will possess the completed key the next day if either Ilsa or Grace dies. Ethan attempts to dissuade Alanna from the sale, allowing Gabriel and Grace to escape. He pursues Grace, but the Entity hacks into their communications and impersonates Benji, leading Ethan into a fight with Paris, whom he defeats but spares. Gabriel incapacitates Grace and kills Ilsa, devastating Ethan. While preparing for the sale, Luther leaves for an off-grid location to prevent interference from the Entity, advising Ethan to spare Gabriel for questioning about the Entity. On the train with Paris, Gabriel kills the engine crew and destroys the throttle and brake. He meets with Denlinger, who attempts to form an alliance with the Entity, which he reveals was originally an advanced cyber weapon developed by the United States, and transferred onto the Sevastopol to sabotage the sub's stealth system. The completed key unlocks a chamber inside the Sevastopol containing the Entity's source code, allowing it to be destroyed or controlled. As this secret is known only to Denlinger, Gabriel kills him, and tries to kill Paris as the Entity has predicted she will betray them after Ethan spared her life. Disguised as Alanna, Grace brings the key to Kittridge, revealed to be the buyer, and negotiates a $100 million sale alongside protection for herself, but pickpockets the key from Kittridge after cancelling the transfer. Ethan parachutes into the train to save Grace, but Gabriel acquires the key. Fighting Ethan atop the train, Gabriel escapes and detonates a bridge ahead. Detaching the runaway locomotive and saving the passengers, Grace and Ethan climb through the falling train cars until they are rescued by Paris, who tells Ethan about the key's connection to the Sevastopol before collapsing. Grace informs Kittridge of her desire to join the IMF. Ethan flees the wreckage by speed wing with the completed key, which he pickpocketed from Gabriel during the fight, and rendezvous with Benji to continue the mission to find the Sevastopol and destroy the Entity.",

    "title": "Avengers: Age of Ultron",
    "plot": "In the Eastern European country of Sokovia, the Avengers—Tony Stark, Thor, Bruce Banner, Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton—raid a Hydra facility commanded by Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, who has experimented on humans using the scepter previously wielded by Loki. They are attacked by two of Strucker's test subjects, twins who have been given superhuman abilities: Pietro (superspeed) and Wanda Maximoff (telepathy and telekinesis). The Avengers apprehend Strucker and retrieve Loki's scepter. Stark and Banner discover an artificial intelligence (AI) within the scepter's gem and secretly use it to complete Stark's \"Ultron\" global defense program. The unexpectedly sentient Ultron, believing he must eradicate humanity to save Earth, eliminates Stark's AI J.A.R.V.I.S. and attacks the Avengers at their headquarters. Escaping with the scepter, Ultron uses the resources in Strucker's Sokovia base to upgrade his rudimentary body and build an army of robot drones. He kills Strucker and recruits the Maximoffs, who hold Stark responsible for the deaths of their parents by his company's weapons. The trio go to the base of arms dealer Ulysses Klaue in Johannesburg to get vibranium. The Avengers attack them there and are subdued by haunting visions created by Wanda. Banner turns into the Hulk and rampages through Johannesburg until Stark stops him with his anti-Hulk armor. A worldwide backlash over the Hulk's destruction, and the fears Wanda's hallucinations incited, send the team into hiding at Barton's farmhouse with his family. Thor departs to consult with Dr. Erik Selvig on the apocalyptic future he saw in his hallucination, while Nick Fury arrives and encourages the team to form a plan to stop Ultron. In Seoul, Ultron uses Loki's scepter to enslave the team's friend Helen Cho. They use her synthetic-tissue technology, vibranium, and the scepter's gem to craft a new body. As Ultron uploads himself into it, Wanda reads his mind and discovers his plan for human extinction; the Maximoffs turn against Ultron. Rogers, Romanoff, and Barton fight Ultron and retrieve the synthetic body, but Ultron captures Romanoff. Stark and Banner upload J.A.R.V.I.S., who has been secretly active inside the Internet to hide from Ultron, into the synthetic body. The Avengers fight among themselves over the decision to upload J.A.R.V.I.S. until Thor returns and helps activate the body. He explains that the scepter's gem is part of his vision, related to the powerful six Infinity Stones, from which the new being gets the name \"Vision\". He earns their trust by being worthy of lifting Thor's hammer, Mjölnir. Vision and the Maximoffs go with the Avengers to Sokovia, where Ultron has used the remaining vibranium to build a machine to lift a large part of the capital city into the sky, intending to crash it into the ground to cause global extinction. Banner rescues Romanoff, who awakens the Hulk for the battle. The Avengers fight Ultron's army while Fury arrives in a Helicarrier with Maria Hill, James Rhodes, and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to evacuate civilians. Pietro dies when he shields Barton from gunfire, and a vengeful Wanda abandons her post to destroy Ultron's primary body. This allows one of his drones to activate the machine, causing the city to plummet. Stark and Thor overload the machine and shatter the landmass. The Hulk, unwilling to endanger Romanoff by being with her, departs in a Quinjet. Vision confronts and destroys Ultron's last remaining drone. After the Avengers establish a new base, Thor returns to Asgard to learn more about his vision. As Stark leaves and Barton retires, Rogers and Romanoff prepare to train new Avengers: Rhodes, Vision, Sam Wilson, and Wanda. In a mid-credits scene, Thanos dons a gauntlet and vows to retrieve the Infinity Stones himself.",

    "plot": "A herd of prehistoric animals is migrating south to avoid a forthcoming ice age. Sid, a clumsy ground sloth, is left behind by his family and personally chases the herd, but is attacked by an angry pair of brontotheres after he ruins their meal. Sid is reluctantly rescued by Manny, a surly woolly mammoth who did not migrate with the others. Sid insists upon following Manny, but the latter wishes to be alone and is frequently annoyed by Sid's outgoing demeanor. Some time before these events, a human tribe hunted and killed half of a Smilodon pack for their pelts. Soto, the leader of the surviving saber-toothed tigers, leads a raid on the human camp, intending to exact revenge by personally killing Roshan, the infant son of the chief. Soto has his lieutenant Diego bring the baby to Soto alive. Roshan's mother, however, flees with her son and leaps over a waterfall. Soto orders Diego to pursue Roshan and bring him back alive, threatening to kill him if he fails. Sid and Manny encounter Roshan and his injured mother in the river at the bottom of the falls. The woman leaves the baby with them, but is washed away. Sid attempts to return the baby to the human settlement, but finds the camp deserted. Diego offers to take the baby off Sid and Manny's hands, but a mistrustful Manny orders Diego to track the humans for them instead. Diego complies, but that night, he secretly sends word back to Soto that he is bringing both the baby and a mammoth for the pack to eat. After several misadventures and bonding moments during their adventure, the \"herd\" of three travels through an ice cave and discovers some human cave paintings. Though Manny experiences a flashback to when his family was killed by human hunters, he has become deeply attached to Roshan. Diego, beginning to second-guess his mission, changes sides completely after Manny saves his life from a lava flow. He informs Sid and Manny of Soto's pack waiting to ambush them at Half Peak. Though the pair remain skeptical, having learned they were set up, Diego successfully convinces them their only chance is to trust him. Sid, Manny, and Diego plot to trick the pack of cats and escape. This initially works, but Soto and two others manage to corner Manny at a cliff edge. Diego jumps in to fight Soto and save Manny, and is severely injured in the process. Soto is thrown against an overhanging rock and is killed by falling icicles, which prompts the rest of his pack to flee. As Sid and Manny grieve for Diego, he convinces them to leave him and return the baby to the humans before the mountain passes fill with snow. Manny and Sid catch up to the humans and Roshan reunites with his father, who gifts Manny a shell and bead necklace. Diego, having survived his injuries, catches up just in time to say goodbye to Roshan, and the reunited trio, now best friends, head back south with the rest of the animals.",

    "title": "Dora and the Search for Sol Dorado",
    "plot": "Ten years earlier, Dora and Diego's grandfather used to tell them Incan stories. He told about Sol Dorado, a fallen magical star that has the power to grant a selfless wish. Dora was given the Map, which she believes guides her on adventures, and loves to explore the Amazon rainforest with Diego. She rescued a monkey and named him Boots. Presently, Dora is on another adventure to search for Sol Dorado. Despite being resistant, Diego joins only for the last adventure. Inside a cave, she interprets a quipu leading to an ancient sundial. However, a booby trap sets off a fire in the cave. Diego activates his Rescue Pack to save Dora, who eventually loses her Map in the fire. Heartbroken, Dora assumes she is nothing without the Map, before she is diverted by the Jungle World's new manager, Camila, whom Dora had admired for years. At Jungle World, Dora becomes a guide on the ride with annoyingly scripted puns, where Diego holds the show of his cockatoo, Mango. There, they discover that Camila is searching the Emperor's Bracelet, the key to Sol Dorado. Diego calls this a myth, but Dora sneaks into Tesoro Inca and unlocks a box using the sundial, from which the bracelet binds to her hand and gives her a vision of three entrances toward Sol Dorado. Camila finds the box empty, suspects Dora of theft, and commands her men to stop Dora from escaping, but the bracelet helps Dora avoid them. On the tram, Dora discovers that Diego had a girlfriend, Naiya, who is driving them during the escape and encounter with the henchmen. Eventually, they crash in the middle of the jungle, potentially leaving Camila behind. From her Backpack, Dora gives Diego his Rescue Pack and Naiya a medical kit to continue their adventure. Dora has a vision of the first location, El Gran Valle de la Muerte, and tries leading the way on her own and with the help of Boots. There, after deciphering a quipu, they find a lead into the graves before the walls could crush them. Eventually, they get a clue toward the Macaws of Cinchona, through another vision Dora gets for the second location. At night, Swiper the Fox traces the group and swipes away Dora's Backpack, making the track easier for his owner, Camila. Dora wakes up heartbroken over losing the Backpack, so Diego calls off the mission before the bracelet binds him back. He opens up about his opportunity for an internship that led to his unwillingness to co-explore. Moving on to the location, a math puzzle guides them through a set of quipu swings. While Naiya, a sudoku player, solves the puzzle, Diego swings over spikes below to unlock the bridge leading them to another clue. Dora has an emotional breakdown over not wanting to lose Diego, so he comforts her and gets a vision of the third location, the Temple of Light. Outside, Camila captures the group and follows the tipline, while Dora falls off the cliff during the encounter. Dora regains consciousness under the full moon and discovers she is the actual map herself. She reads the stars to find the exact way, activates the Rescue Pack against Camila's group, and uses the sundial to open the Temple. However, Camila tailgates Dora's group and opens up about her career failure, which led her to selfishly search for Sol Dorado. Inside, Dora and Camila decode the quipu together, leading them to weigh the gold on the scales to open the gateway ahead in return. There was not enough gold for the last scale, so Camila sacrifices herself to open the gateway before the bracelet rescues her. They connect the third clue, and Camila opens the Sol Dorado using the bracelet as the key. Camila and Dora commit to having found their true selves, the Crusader and the Explorer, respectively, so they selflessly use the wish to prevent Diego from losing his internship. Diego and Naiya reconcile during the adventure and vow to stay connected. Diego bids farewell before leaving for New York City. Dora finally sees the green flash as Diego gives her the new Map, prompting another adventure.",

    "title": "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey",
    "plot": "Before his 111th birthday, the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins writes a story of his adventure for his nephew, Frodo. Sixty years ago, the Dwarf king Thrór led his kin to prosperity under the Lonely Mountain until the dragon Smaug arrived. Smaug destroyed Dale, drove the Dwarves from their mountain, and took their gold. Thrór's grandson, Thorin Oakenshield, appealed to Elf king Thranduil for help, but was denied, causing him to foster a hatred for Elves. In the Shire, 51-year-old Bilbo is tricked by the wizard Gandalf the Grey into hosting a dinner for Thorin and his company of Dwarves: Balin, Dwalin, Fíli, Kíli, Dori, Nori, Ori, Óin, Glóin, Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur. Gandalf aims to recruit Bilbo as the company's \"burglar\" to assist them in their quest to enter the Lonely Mountain. Reluctant at first, Bilbo changes his mind after the company leaves without him the next day, racing to join them. Traveling onward, they are captured by three Trolls. Bilbo delays the Trolls from eating them until dawn, and Gandalf exposes them to sunlight, turning them to stone. The company discovers the Trolls' cave and finds treasure and Elven blades. Thorin and Gandalf each take an Elf-made blade, Orcrist and Glamdring, respectively; Gandalf gives an Elven dagger to Bilbo. The wizard Radagast the Brown finds the company and tells Gandalf about his encounter with the Necromancer, a sorcerer who has been corrupting Greenwood with dark magic, at Dol Guldur. Chased by Orcs, Gandalf leads them through a hidden passage to Rivendell. There, Lord Elrond discloses a hidden indication of a secret door on the company's map of the Lonely Mountain, which will be visible only on Durin's Day. Gandalf approaches the White Council — consisting of Elrond, Galadriel and Saruman the White — and presents a Morgul blade, the Witch-king of Angmar's weapon, which Radagast obtained from Dol Guldur as a sign that the Necromancer is linked to an eventual return of Sauron. Saruman expresses concern about the Dwarves' quest and requests Gandalf to end it. However, Gandalf secretly reveals to Galadriel that he anticipated this and had the Dwarves move forward without him. The company ventures into the Misty Mountains and evades fighting Stone Giants. They seek refuge in a cave but are captured by Goblins and taken to their leader, the Great Goblin. Bilbo becomes separated from the Dwarves and falls into a crevice where he meets Gollum, who accidentally drops a golden ring. Bilbo pockets the ring and confronts Gollum. They play a riddle game, wagering that if Bilbo wins, he will be shown the way out; if he loses, Gollum will eat him. Bilbo tricks Gollum and wins, but Gollum realizes his ring is missing. Chased by Gollum, Bilbo discovers the ring grants him invisibility. As he escapes, Bilbo briefly considers killing Gollum, but spares him out of pity. The Great Goblin informs the Dwarves that Azog, an Orc war-chief who killed Thrór and lost to Thorin outside of Moria, has placed a bounty on Thorin. Gandalf arrives, helps the Dwarves escape, and kills the Great Goblin. Bilbo reunites with the group and hides his new ring. The company is ambushed by Azog and takes refuge in trees. Thorin charges Azog but is injured by his Warg. Bilbo saves Thorin and confronts Azog, just as eagles summoned by Gandalf to rescue them arrive. The company escapes to Carrock, where Gandalf heals Thorin, who then renounces his disdain for Bilbo. They see the Lonely Mountain in the distance, where the sleeping Smaug is awoken by a thrush knocking a snail against a stone.",

    "title": "Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire",
    "plot": "Three years after the events in Summerville, Oklahoma, Callie Spengler, her boyfriend Gary Grooberson, her children Trevor and Phoebe, and their friends Lucky Domingo and Podcast, relocate to New York City to aid Winston Zeddemore and Ray Stantz in re-establishing the Ghostbusters. After the group captures a ghost known as the Hell's Kitchen Sewer Dragon, Walter Peck, the Ghostbusters' long-time opponent and the city's mayor, threatens to close them down. To appease Peck, Callie removes Phoebe from the team for being underage. Upset, Phoebe plays chess in a nearby park, where she encounters and befriends Melody, a ghost of a teenage girl killed in a fire. Ray and Podcast collect cursed objects for examination. Nadeem Razmaadi sells them a strange brass orb with ritual markings written in Mesopotamian Arabic. Ray determines it is an apotropaic trap due to copper alloys typically being used in rituals since the Bronze Age, believed to have spiritual conductivity. When Ray evaluates its psychokinetic energy levels, the orb emits broad-spectrum psionic energy. A cold wave travels from the orb to the Ghostbusters' firehouse headquarters and damages the ecto-containment unit, which is at near capacity. Winston takes the orb to his company's paranormal research and development center, run by Dr. Lars Pinfield. Using an experimental extraction device, he is unable to extract any orenda from it. The orb's captive psychically sabotages one of the center's ecto-confinements, allowing a ghost known as The Possessor to escape and hide in Podcast's equipment. To learn more, Lars joins Trevor and Lucky to see Nadeem, who reveals that his grandmother kept the orb hidden within a brass-lined chamber. Peter Venkman, brought in to help, discovers Nadeem has latent pyrokinesis. Ray, accompanied by Phoebe and Podcast, visits Dr. Hubert Wartzki, a New York Public Library research librarian and anthropologist, who explains the orb was built over four thousand years ago in Southwest Asia by sorcerers known as the Firemasters to imprison Garraka, a demigod who sought to conquer humanity with endowment of \"Kusharit Umoti\", or the Death Chill, which can kill living creatures through fear alone. Nadeem's grandmother was of the lineage of the Firemasters, who prevented Garraka from escaping the orb in 1904 during a mock ritual conducted by members of the Manhattan Adventurers' Society, whom he froze to death. Garraka was confined in the orb due to being vulnerable to brass. This, combined with fire, and the removal of his horns trapped him within the orb. When the trio attempts to stop the escaped Possessor from stealing a phonographic recording of the club's ritual, Peck exploits Phoebe's involvement to shut down the Ghostbusters. After an argument with Gary and her mother, Phoebe runs away and takes Melody to Winston's research center. She uses his extraction equipment to project herself as a ghost for two minutes so the duo can physically interact. Melody reveals she had been secretly working with Garraka, who has offered her passage to the afterlife. By controlling Phoebe's disembodied spirit, Garraka forces her physical body to recite the ritual chant. He then escapes, recovers his removed horns at Nadeem's residence and begins freezing the city. Realizing Garraka will free the ghosts in the containment unit after freeing ones at the center, the Ghostbusters gather to defend their headquarters. They are aided by Nadeem, who dons the Firemaster brass armor kept by his grandmother and attempts to master his powers. Garraka overpowers them and breaches the containment unit. Phoebe electroplates Egon Spengler's proton pack with brass to strengthen it; Melody atones for her misdeeds by helping Nadeem utilize his powers to weaken Garraka. Ray, with help from his fellow veteran Ghostbusters (including Janine Melnitz), captures Garraka by turning the ruptured containment unit into a giant ghost trap. A passage is opened for Melody, and she reconciles with Phoebe before departing for the afterlife to reunite with her family. As the city thaws, the Ghostbusters are hailed as heroes again, with Peck forced to support the team and reinstate Phoebe. The Ghostbusters begin pursuing escaped ghosts, including the Sewer Dragon and Slimer across New York City.",

    "plot": "In present-day Paris, Diana Prince receives a photographic plate from Wayne Enterprises of herself and four men taken during World War I, prompting her to recall her past. Diana, the daughter of Queen Hippolyta, is raised on the hidden island of Themyscira, home to the Amazons, women warriors created by the Olympian gods to protect mankind. Hippolyta tells Diana the story of how Ares became jealous of humanity and orchestrated its destruction. When the other gods attempted to stop him, Ares killed all but Zeus, who used the last of his power to wound him and force his retreat. Before dying, Zeus left the Amazons a weapon, the \"god-killer\", to prepare them for Ares' return. Hippolyta reluctantly agrees to let her sister, Antiope, train Diana as a warrior. In 1918, Diana rescues US pilot Captain Steve Trevor when his plane crashes off the Themysciran coast. The island is soon invaded by German soldiers, who had been pursuing him. The Amazons wipe out the German landing force, with Antiope sacrificing herself to save Diana. Steve is interrogated with the Lasso of Hestia and reveals that a great war is consuming the outside world and that he is an Allied spy. He has stolen a notebook from the Germans' chief chemist, Dr. Isabel Maru, who is attempting to engineer a deadlier form of mustard gas under the orders of General Erich Ludendorff. Believing Ares to be responsible for the war, Diana arms herself with the \"god-killer\" sword, the lasso, and armor before leaving Themyscira with Steve. In London, they deliver Maru's notebook to the Supreme War Council, where Sir Patrick Morgan is trying to negotiate an armistice with Germany. Diana translates Maru's notes, revealing that the Germans plan to release the deadly gas at the Western Front. Although forbidden by his commander to act, Steve, with secret funding from Morgan, recruits Moroccan spy Sameer, Scottish marksman Charlie, and Native American smuggler Chief Napi to help prevent the gas from being released. The team reaches the front in Belgium. Diana goes alone through No Man's Land and destroys the enemy trench, liberating the nearby village of Veld with the aid of the Allied forces. The team briefly celebrates, taking a photograph in the village, where Diana and Steve fall in love. The team learns that a gala will be held at the nearby German High Command. Steve and Diana separately infiltrate the party; he intends to locate the gas and destroy it and she hopes to kill Ludendorff, believing that he is Ares. Steve stops her to avoid jeopardizing his mission, but this allows Ludendorff to unleash the gas on Veld, killing its inhabitants. Blaming Steve for intervening, Diana pursues Ludendorff to a base where the gas is being loaded into a bomber aircraft bound for London. She fights and kills him, but is confused and disillusioned when his death does not stop the war. Sir Patrick appears and reveals himself to be Ares. He tells Diana that although he has subtly given humans ideas and inspirations, it is ultimately their decision to resort to violence, as they are inherently corrupt. When Diana attempts to kill Ares with the \"god-killer\" sword, he destroys it before revealing to Diana that she is the \"god-killer\", since she is the daughter of Zeus. While the two battle, Steve's team destroys Maru's laboratory. Steve hijacks and pilots the bomber carrying the poison to a safe altitude and detonates it, blowing up the plane and himself. Ares attempts to direct Diana's rage and grief at Steve's death by convincing her to kill Maru, but the memories of her experiences with Steve cause her to realize that humans have goodness within them. She spares Maru and redirects Ares's lightning into him, definitively killing him. Later, the team celebrates the end of the war. In the present day, Diana sends an email to Bruce Wayne thanking him for the photographic plate of her and Steve. She continues to fight on the world's behalf as Wonder Woman.",

    "title": "Hercules",
    "plot": "Hercules leads a band of mercenaries composed of king-turned-prophet Amphiaraus of Argos, thief Autolycus of Sparta, mute and feral barbarian Tydeus of Thebes, Amazon archer Atalanta of Scythia, and storyteller and nephew to Hercules, Iolaus of Athens. Hercules is said to be the demigod son of Zeus, who completed the legendary Twelve Labors after being betrayed by Hera, who drove him insane and caused him to murder his wife and children during a visit to King Eurystheus. It remains unclear whether Hercules is truly the son of Zeus and many are skeptical of the claim as well as of the stories of his Twelve Labors. Despite this, Hercules displays unusual inhuman strength and nigh-unmatched skill in combat as well as a potent healing factor. He is also frequently haunted by the memory of the deaths of loved ones as well as visions of Cerberus. On the Macedonian Coast in Northern Greece in 358 BC, Hercules and his team are approached by Ergenia. Her father King Cotys wants Hercules to train the armies of Thrace to defend the kingdom from bloodthirsty warlord/sorcerer Rhesus. Hercules accepts after being offered his weight in gold and the band is welcomed to Thrace by Cotys and General Sitacles, leader of the Thracian army. When Rhesus reaches Central Thrace, Cotys insists that Hercules lead the army into battle to defend the Bessi tribe there despite Hercules's objections and the army's lack of training. However, they are too late as Rhesus' supposed sorcery has turned the Bessi against the Thracians. After the Bessi are defeated following a long and disastrous battle which results in at least half the Thracian forces being killed, Hercules and his allies properly train the army. When the training is complete, Hercules and Sitacles confront Rhesus' army before Mount Asticus. After an arduous battle, Hercules' side wins. Rhesus is taken back to Thrace as a prisoner, where he is publicly humiliated. Taking pity, Hercules stops the townsfolk from throwing more objects at him. When Hercules mentions Rhesus' actions of burning down villages, Rhesus tells him it was not him or his army that committed those atrocities. Later in the palace hall, Rhesus is chained up and left on display. Noticing that Ergenia has taken pity on him, Hercules confronts her and finds out Rhesus was telling the truth. He was merely retaliating against Cotys' attempts to expand his kingdom. Ergenia does not agree with Cotys's methods, but goes along out of fear as her cruel father already poisoned her husband, the previous king. Furthermore, Cotys threatens his grandson Arius, the true heir to the throne. After receiving their reward, the mercenaries are ready to leave, but Hercules decides to stay behind and stop Cotys. All but Autolycus choose to follow him. However, they are overpowered and captured by Sitacles and his men. While chained, Hercules is confronted by King Eurystheus, who is in league with Cotys. Eurystheus reveals that he drugged Hercules the night his family died, viewing him as a threat to his power. Hercules' family was actually killed by three black wolves sent by Eurystheus, resulting in Hercules' constant hallucinations of Cerberus. When Cotys orders Ergenia to be executed for her betrayal, Hercules is encouraged by Amphiaraus to believe in himself. In a show of superhuman strength, Hercules breaks free of his chains, saving Ergenia and defeating the wolves single-handedly. Hercules releases the prisoners, including Rhesus, and then confronts Eurystheus, killing him and avenging his family. However, he is ambushed by Sitacles who is then stabbed to death by Iolaus. Outside, Hercules and his forces battle Cotys' army. Arius is taken hostage, but rescued by Autolycus who has decided to return to help his friends. In the ensuing battle, Tydeus is mortally wounded while protecting Arius, but fights on, slaughtering numerous soldiers until he falls and dies in Hercules's arms, but not before saying Hercules's name. Again using inhuman strength, Hercules pushes a massive statue of Hera from its foundations and uses it to crush Cotys and many of his soldiers. Impressed by this feat, the surviving soldiers bow to Hercules, recognizing him as a demigod and the son of Zeus as lighting strikes in the background. Arius takes the throne with Ergenia at his side.",

He buries Koro and sets out to rescue his clan. Noa is joined by Raka, an orangutan who tells Noa about Caesar's teachings. The apes notice the human scavenger is following them; Raka offers her food and a blanket, naming her Nova. When the trio encounters a group of feral humans with a herd of zebras, Sylva's raiders suddenly attack them. Noa and Raka rescue Nova, who, to their surprise, is intelligent and can speak. She reveals that her name is Mae and that the raiders took Noa's clan to a beachfront settlement outside an old human vault. As they cross a bridge on their way to the settlement, they are ambushed by Sylva. In the ensuing fight, Raka saves Mae from drowning but is swept away by the rapids. Noa and Mae are captured and taken to the apes' settlement. Noa reunites with his clan and is introduced to the apes' king, Proximus Caesar. Proximus has enslaved other clans, forcing them to work on opening the vault so he can access the human technology locked inside. Proximus invites Noa to dinner with Mae and Trevathan, another speaking human prisoner who teaches Proximus about the old human world. Proximus believes that Noa's intuitiveness could help open the vault and warns him that Mae only has her own agenda. Noa confronts Mae, demanding the truth in exchange for his help. Mae discloses knowledge of a hidden entrance to the vault and seeks a book capable of restoring speech to humanity. Noa agrees to help her enter and destroy the vault. Noa, Mae, Soona, and Anaya secretly plant explosives around the sea walls that protect the settlement. Trevathan catches them and intends to warn Proximus, but Mae strangles him to death. The group enters the vault, finding a stockpile of weapons and Mae's \"book\", which is actually a satellite decryption key. The apes discover old children's picture books depicting humans as the once-dominant species and apes in cages at a zoo. As the group makes their way out of the bunker, they are confronted by Proximus and his followers. Lightning, one of Proximus' lieutenants, threatens to kill Soona, but Mae kills him with a gun and, rather than allow Proximus to claim the weaponry in the vault, triggers the explosives, flooding the bunker with the apes inside. Mae flees the settlement while the apes climb to higher ground through the bunker. Noa is pursued by Sylva, whom he traps and leaves to drown. Noa then escapes the bunker but is attacked by Proximus. Noa leads his clan in summoning their eagles to attack Proximus and send him falling off a cliff into the sea. As Noa's clan returns to rebuild their home, Mae arrives to bid farewell to Noa, secretly holding a gun behind her back. She explains that she destroyed the bunker to prevent the apes from obtaining its weapons. Given their disparities, Noa and Mae question whether apes and humans can co-exist peacefully. As Noa takes Soona to look through a telescope he found on his journey, Mae travels to an intelligent human settlement at a satellite base. Mae delivers the decryption key, allowing them to reactivate the satellites, during which they manage to make contact with another human settlement.",

    "title": "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End",
    "plot": "Now in control of the oceans, Lord Cutler Beckett executes anyone associated with piracy in Port Royal and orders Davy Jones to destroy all pirate ships, also forcing him to kill the Kraken. Condemned prisoners sing Hoist the Colours to compel nine Pirate Lords from around the world to convene at Shipwreck Cove to hold the Brethren Court and address the threat Beckett poses. Because Pirate Lord Jack Sparrow never named a successor before being dragged to Davy Jones' Locker, Hector Barbossa, Will Turner, Elizabeth Swann, Tia Dalma, and the surviving crew of the Black Pearl plot to rescue him. In Singapore, the crew meet Pirate Lord Sao Feng, who owns navigational charts to the Locker before they are attacked by the East India Trading Company. During the battle, Will secretly promises to give Jack to Feng in return for the Pearl, intending to use it to rescue his father \"Bootstrap Bill\" Turner from the Flying Dutchman. The crew crosses over into the Locker, rescues Jack and recovers the Pearl. While departing, they encounter boats of dead souls, including Elizabeth's father Governor Swann, executed by Beckett. The goddess Calypso charged Davy Jones with guiding the souls of those who died at sea to the next world; every ten years he could come ashore to be with the woman he loved, but after his lover never arrived to meet him, Jones corrupted his purpose and cursed himself to become a monster. Whoever kills Jones by stabbing his disembodied heart must become the Dutchman's captain. Returning to the living world, the Pearl stops at an island for fresh water, but the crew is attacked by Sao Feng and Beckett's men. As Jack secretly negotiates his freedom with Beckett, Elizabeth is handed over to Feng, who believes she is Calypso, while the rest of the crew make for Shipwreck Cove aboard the Pearl. Jack throws Will off the ship as part of a plan to seize control of the Dutchman. Sao Feng tells Elizabeth that the first Brethren Court bound Calypso in human form after her lover, Davy Jones, betrayed her; Feng plans to release her to defeat Beckett. Feng is wounded in an attack by Jones, appointing Elizabeth his successor as Pirate Lord before dying. Elizabeth and the crew are locked in the brig of the Dutchman, where she finds Bootstrap Bill losing himself to the Dutchman's curse. Admiral James Norrington frees Elizabeth and her crew from the Dutchman, but is killed by a crazed Bootstrap Bill. Will is rescued by Beckett and informs Jones of Jack's escape from the Locker, learning in the process that Jones enabled the first Court to imprison Calypso, revealed to be Tia Dalma. The Pearl arrives at Shipwreck Cove, where Barbossa attempts to persuade the Brethren Court to release Calypso while Elizabeth demands they fight back against Beckett. The Keeper of the Code, Captain Teague, informs the Court that only an elected Pirate King can declare war. To avoid a stalemate, Jack votes for Elizabeth, making her King. Elizabeth, Jack, Barbossa, Beckett, Jones, and Will parley, trading Will for Jack. Barbossa frees Calypso, but when Will reveals Jones' betrayal to her, Calypso vanishes and summons a maelstrom, refusing to help either side. The Pearl and Dutchman battle in the maelstrom. During the battle, Elizabeth and Will are wed by Barbossa. On the Dutchman, Jack and Jones duel for control of Jones' heart. After Jones mortally wounds Will, Jack helps Will stab the heart, killing Jones. Jack and Elizabeth escape the Dutchman, which sinks into the maelstrom. As Beckett's ship, the Endeavour, engages the Pearl, the Dutchman rises from the sea, now captained by Will and its crew freed from Jones' curse. The two pirate ships destroy the Endeavour, killing Beckett, while his armada retreats. With Will bound to guide souls lost at sea to the next world, he and Elizabeth bid farewell to each other. Will departs on the Dutchman, leaving Elizabeth pregnant and with the chest containing his heart. Barbossa steals the Pearl again to find the Fountain of Youth, but finds that Jack has stolen Feng's charts. Jack departs from Tortuga on a small boat to track the fountain down. In a post-credits scene, ten years later, Elizabeth and her son watch Will return aboard the Dutchman.",

    "title": "The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2",
    "plot": "The film continues from the events of the previous film, as Bella, who has just given birth, awakens from her human-to-vampire transformation. After her vampire husband Edward Cullen helps her tame her initial thirst for blood, Bella is introduced to their daughter Renesmee. The rest of the Cullens and Bella's werewolf friend Jacob stay nearby, and when Jacob acts possessively towards Renesmee, Bella learns he has \"imprinted\" on her, a werewolf phenomenon that makes Jacob and Renesmee soul-mates. Meanwhile, Bella's father, Charlie, has been trying to contact the Cullens for updates on Bella's health. Carlisle, the Cullen patriarch and a medical doctor, announces that they have to leave Forks, Washington, to protect their identities. Jacob, desperate not to lose Renesmee, visits Charlie and tells him that Bella is alive and vaguely describes that she has transformed, revealing his wolf form to Charlie to persuade him to stop asking further questions. Charlie goes to the Cullen house to see Bella and meet Renesmee. He accepts that Bella is now recovered but somehow different, though he does not know what has changed or where Renesmee came from, instead accepting she is \"adopted\". Several months pass with Carlisle monitoring Renesmee's rapid growth. The vampire Irina spots Renesmee in the forest and mistakenly assumes she is an \"immortal child\": a type of vampire transformed in childhood who, because it cannot be reasoned with or trained, sucks the blood out of humans uncontrollably. The creation of such children is outlawed by the vampire leadership, the Volturi, and anyone caught with one is executed on the spot. Irina reports the supposed crime to the Volturi. After Edward's sister Alice, who can see glimpses of the future, experiences a vision of the Volturi and Irina coming to kill the Cullens, she instructs the others to gather as many witnesses as they can to testify that Renesmee is not an immortal child. As the Volturi serve punishments swiftly, the Cullens and their werewolf allies prepare for a possible battle. Bella soon realizes she has a special ability: a powerful mental shield that had protected her from Edward's mind-reading even when she was human, which she is taught to extend to protect others from vampire superpowers. The army of the Volturi arrives in Forks, led by Aro, who can read people's minds by touching them. Seeing the Cullens alongside their witnesses and allies, the Volturi hesitate. The Cullens are able to prove to Aro that Renesmee is not an immortal child. However, the Volturi are eager to subdue the Cullens to forcibly enlist their talented members, so they summarily execute Irina for her mistake to provoke the Cullens into battle. But before an all-out fight breaks out, Alice appears in time to give Aro her vision of the future if fighting ensues. In Alice's violent vision, Carlisle, Aro, and several others on both sides are killed, including other Volturi, Cullens, and werewolves. Aro, despite being afraid of the vision, still wants to execute Renesmee as she might be a threat to the vampires' secrecy. Alice reveals their final witness, a Mapuche man from South America, who is a half-human half-vampire, just like Renesmee. He proves that he is not a threat, supporting the notion that Renesmee is not one either. The Volturi unhappily leave, Aro concluding that there will be no battle today. Back at the Cullen home, Alice glimpses the future, seeing Edward and Bella greeting Jacob and a fully matured Renesmee, also a couple, on a sun-dappled beach. Edward reads Alice's mind and feels relieved that Renesmee has Jacob to protect her. Alone in their favorite meadow, Bella pushes her mental shield away and finally allows Edward to see into her mind, showing him every moment they have shared together in a montage. They kiss after Bella tells him, \"nobody has ever loved anybody as much as I love you\", and he romantically responds \"There’s one exception\".",

    "title": "Gladiator II",
    "plot": "Sixteen years after Marcus Aurelius's death, Rome is ruled by the corrupt twin emperors Caracalla and Geta. In the North African kingdom of Numidia, Hanno lives with his wife, Arishat. The Roman army led by General Justus Acacius invades and conquers the kingdom, killing Arishat and enslaving Hanno and the other survivors. The enslaved people are taken to Ostia, where the Romans pit them against baboons to advertise them as potential gladiators. Hanno savagely kills one, impressing the stable master Macrinus, who promises Hanno an opportunity to kill Acacius if he wins enough fights in Rome. Acacius returns to Rome as a war hero. Caracalla and Geta prepare gladiatorial games in the Colosseum to celebrate. Acacius asks for a break from war with his wife Lucilla, Aurelius' daughter, but the emperors refuse and plot to conquer Persia and India. Senator Thraex hosts a party for the emperors, featuring a gladiatorial duel. After Hanno wins, he recites a verse from Virgil's Aeneid, revealing his Roman education and raising Macrinus' suspicion. Acacius and Lucilla conspire with Thraex and Senator Gracchus to overthrow the emperors and restore the Republic. Hanno emulates the late legendary gladiator Maximus in the Colosseum to win fights. Lucilla realizes that Hanno is her son, Lucius Verus, whom she sent away as a child to protect him from rivals for the throne after her brother's death. Lucilla visits Lucius and tries reconnecting with him, but he angrily rebuffs her, believing she had abandoned him. Lucilla reveals to Lucius that he is Maximus' son and tells him to use his father's strength to survive. During a naval battle in the Colosseum, Lucius leads the gladiators to victory and fires a crossbow at the spectating Acacius but fails to kill him. Ravi, the gladiators' physician, befriends Lucius and shows him the shrine to Maximus, which includes Maximus' sword and armor. Lucilla and Acacius conspire to free Lucius as part of their plot to dethrone the emperors. Thraex, who owes Macrinus money, informs him of the conspiracy; Lucilla and Acacius are arrested for treason. Macrinus advises the emperors to have Acacius killed in the Colosseum and arranges for Lucius to fight him. After a brief fight, Acacius surrenders to Lucius and professes his love for Lucilla and Maximus. Lucius refuses to execute Acacius, but the Praetorian Guard does so at the emperors' command, prompting the people to riot. When Macrinus questions Lucius' refusal to kill Acacius, Lucius argues that Rome can be a better place. Macrinus tricks Caracalla into believing that Geta will blame him for the riot; Caracalla kills Geta with Macrinus' help. Lucilla and Lucius reconcile; she gives him her father's ring, which also belonged to Maximus and Acacius. Increasingly delusional, Caracalla names his monkey, Dondus, as a consul alongside Macrinus. Macrinus persuades the Senate that he can restore order and assumes control of the Praetorians. He reveals to Lucilla that he was a slave under Aurelius' rule and vows to avenge himself by becoming emperor. Macrinus convinces Caracalla to have Lucilla executed in the Colosseum (the crucifixion being allowed only on slaves and Christians), with only Lucius to defend her, hoping their deaths will trigger another riot that the Senate will defuse by executing Caracalla. Lucius sends Ravi with the ring to request military aid from Acacius' legions outside Rome. Lucilla is brought into the Colosseum, accompanied by the senators with whom she conspired, while Lucius rallies the gladiators to revolt against their enslavers. Armed with Maximus' sword and armor, he leads the gladiators to defend Lucilla from execution. Gracchus is killed in the onslaught, while Macrinus kills Caracalla before fatally shooting Lucilla with an arrow. Macrinus flees the rioting city with Lucius in pursuit. Acacius' legions and Macrinus' Praetorians confront each other outside Rome. To prevent a battle, Lucius duels Macrinus. Lucius ultimately kills Macrinus and reveals his identity as the imperial heir, persuading both armies to unite with him for a stronger Rome. Later, Lucius mourns his parents in the Colosseum.",

    "plot": "Prior to being imprisoned for grand larceny, bard Edgin \"Ed\" Darvis served in the Harpers, an order of peacekeepers, until his wife was killed by disciples of a Red Wizard he arrested. Accompanied by barbarian Holga Kilgore, Edgin attempted to make a new life for himself and his daughter Kira by turning to theft, teaming with amateur sorcerer Simon Aumar, rogue con artist Forge Fitzwilliam, and Forge's mysterious acquaintance Sofina. While raiding a Harper stronghold, Edgin attempted to steal a \"Tablet of Reawakening\" to resurrect his wife, but he and Holga were captured, though their accomplices escaped. After two years' imprisonment in frozen Revel's End, Edgin and Holga escape to Neverwinter and learn Forge has become Lord there after its prior Lord was mysteriously incapacitated. He has been taking care of Kira, convincing her that Edgin's greed led to his arrest. It is revealed that Sofina is a Red Wizard and together they orchestrated Edgin and Holga's capture. Sofina orders Edgin and Holga's execution, but they escape and decide to rob Forge's vault and bring Kira home during the upcoming High Sun Games, needing the tablet to prove their innocence to Kira and resurrect Edgin's wife. Edgin and Holga track down Simon to help. With his help, the group also recruits Doric, a druid whose forest community is fighting forced logging ordered by Forge. After shapeshifting into a fly, Doric infiltrates Forge's castle and finds the vault has magical defenses from Mordenkainen, which Simon cannot disable. He believes the magic relic, \"The Helm of Disjunction,\" could help, and the group travels to a graveyard to ask Holga's ancestors where to find it. Simon resurrects the dead with a talisman long enough for them to answer the group's questions. The corpses reveal they gave the Helm to Xenk Yandar, a paladin who fled Thay, his country, when Red Wizard Szass Tam turned Thayans into an undead army. After forcing Edgin to swear to distribute any gained bounty to the people, Xenk guides the group through the Underdark to retrieve the Helm. With the help of a teleportation staff obtained from Holga's halfling ex-husband, they find the relic but are attacked by Thayan assassins sent by Sofina. Xenk fights them off and helps the group escape from the obese red dragon Themberchaud before departing. Simon has trouble mastering the Helm's power, so they decide to use the staff to enter the vault during the games. Simon and Holga infiltrate the vault but find the room empty except for a magical trap. Sofina, disguised as Kira, subdues Edgin. The group is captured and forced to participate in the games, but escapes the stadium. Doric discovers Forge has loaded the treasure onto a boat and is preparing to flee. The group steals the boat for themselves and rescues Kira from Forge. As they escape, the group realize Sofina organized the games to draw a massive crowd and turn them into an undead army using the curse that destroyed Thay. The group returns, transporting Forge's stolen riches out of the boat with the teleportation staff and spreading them across the city by hot-air balloon, drawing people out of the stadium before Sofina's spell takes effect. Enraged at her failure, Sofina attacks the group. Simon nullifies her time-stop spell, allowing Kira to use the invisibility pendant Edgin and Holga gave her as a child to place an anti-magic bracelet on Sofina. Although the group manages to incapacitate Sofina, Holga is fatally injured. Edgin uses the tablet to bring her back to life, realizing he wanted to bring back his wife only for his own sake, while Holga had become a true part of their family. Doric expresses being open to a relationship with Simon. Restored, the old Lord of Neverwinter declares the team heroes of the realm. Xenk sends Forge to Revel's End, where he fails to escape as Edgin and Holga did when his pardon is denied.",

When the egg hatches, the trio adopt the chick as their brother, Private. Ten years later, Circus Zaragoza is continuing their American tour in Kentucky. The penguins leave to celebrate Private's birthday by breaking into Fort Knox to get Cheesy Dibbles from a vending machine, despite Private's wish of being recognized as a meaningful and valued team member. The penguins are subsequently kidnapped and taken to a submarine in Venice, where they meet Dave, a Giant Pacific octopus who was once an attraction at the Central Park Zoo until they upstaged him when they arrived. After being repeatedly transferred between numerous zoos and aquariums around the world, continuously upstaged by penguins, Dave disguised himself as a human scientist named Dr. Octavius Brine to enact his revenge. Rico swallows a vial of Dave's snow globe collection from every zoo and aquarium that he was transferred to and his chemical, the Medusa Serum before the penguins escape. Fleeing through Venice while pursued by Dave's octopus henchmen, the penguins are rescued by the North Wind, an inter-species intelligence agency consisting of Eurasian wolf leader whose name is classified (Skipper calls him \"Classified\"), polar bear muscle Corporal, harp seal demolitionist Short Fuse, and snowy owl intelligence analyst Eva. The penguins show the North Wind the Medusa Serum, but Dave calls to reveal he actually has much more serum. The North Wind gets alerts of Dave kidnapping captive penguins around the world. Deeming Skipper's team a liability to the mission, Classified tranquilizes them and puts them on a plane bound for a North Wind safe house in Madagascar. The penguins escape the plane, and, using Dave's snow globes, realize Dave targets every zoo and aquarium he was kicked out of, with the Shanghai Zoo as his next target. The penguins forms a plan to stop Dave, and Private reluctantly agrees to be the bait. They manage to trap Dave with a dinosaur skeleton just as the North Wind shows up. Dave escapes through a drain and captures the Shanghai penguins along with Private. Skipper, Rico, and Kowalski hijack the North Wind's jet to pursue him. At Dave's lair, Private learns that Dave plans to use the Medusa Serum to turn penguins into monsters for the public to hate and exterminate. Upon reaching Dave's hideout, the penguins and the North Wind clash over their different plans to infiltrate the submarine, before Skipper relents and goes with the North Wind's plan. The penguins distract the octopus guards while the North Wind sneak inside, but both teams are captured. Dave tests the Medusa Serum on Private, but he escapes using a paper clip he swallowed earlier, unbeknownst to everyone present, who believe Private has been vaporized. Private finds and frees the North Wind, but they refuse to help without their equipment, so Private goes alone. As Dr. Brine, Dave unleashes the mutated penguins on New York City. Private obtains Dave's ray, finds Skipper, Rico, and Kowalski, and restores their sanity. As the penguins and the North Wind battle Dave and his henchmen, Private inserts himself into Dave's ray, using the power of his cuteness to restore the other penguins. This leaves Private mutated, and Dave shrunk and trapped inside one of his snow globes. Skipper deems Private the most meaningful and valued member of the team, to the approval of the North Wind, who give the penguins jetpacks.",

    "plot": "Twenty-two years after the Jurassic Park disaster on Isla Nublar in 1993, a new dinosaur theme park called Jurassic World has been built on the island, owned by Masrani Global Corporation in affiliation with InGen, which created the dinosaurs. Brothers Zach and Gray Mitchell visit the park, where their aunt Claire Dearing works as the operations manager. She assigns her assistant Zara to guide them, but they evade her and explore on their own. Navy veteran and ethologist Owen Grady has been training a Velociraptor squad composed of Blue, Charlie, Delta, and Echo, and researching their intelligence. Based on the raptors' ability to follow commands, the head of InGen security Vic Hoskins believes that the animals can be weaponized, an idea Owen and his assistant Barry vehemently oppose. Claire and Jurassic World owner Simon Masrani inspect the park's newest upcoming attraction, the Indominus rex, a transgenic dinosaur created by geneticist Dr. Henry Wu. Masrani tasks Owen with evaluating the enclosure's security. Owen warns Claire that the Indominus lacks social skills, making it dangerous and unpredictable. When the Indominus seemingly escapes, Owen and two other workers investigate. The dinosaur, capable of camouflaging itself and masking its heat signature, suddenly appears and devours the other two men, but Owen manages to survive. The Indominus escapes its paddock and into the island's interior. Owen urges Masrani to destroy it, but Masrani, trying to protect his company's investment, sends a unit to subdue it using non-lethal weaponry. After most of the unit is killed, Claire orders the evacuation of the northern sector, while Masrani confronts Wu about the Indominus design. While exploring the park in a tour vehicle, Zach and Gray enter a restricted area. The Indominus arrives and destroys the vehicle, but the boys narrowly escape. They find the ruins of the original Jurassic Park visitor center, repair an old Jeep Wrangler, and drive back to the park resort. As Claire and Owen search for the boys, they barely escape the Indominus as well. Masrani and two soldiers hunt the Indominus by helicopter, but it breaks into the park's aviary. The Pteranodons and Dimorphodons, startled by the Indominus, flee the aviary and fly into Masrani's helicopter, causing it to crash and kill its passengers. The escaped pterosaurs converge on the resort and attack everyone, including Zara, who is then devoured by a Mosasaurus. Zach and Gray find Owen and Claire at the resort as armed personnel shoot down the pterosaurs. Hoskins assumes command and orders the raptors to be used to track the Indominus, whereupon Owen reluctantly complies and spearheads the assault with the raptors. Upon finding it, the dinosaurs begin communicating with one another. Owen realizes that the Indominus has Velociraptor DNA, and it usurps Owen's command of the raptors, becoming the pack's new alpha. Soldiers fire on the Indominus, but it escapes. The raptors slaughter most of the soldiers, while Charlie is killed in the chaos. Hoskins evacuates Wu and the dinosaur embryos from the island to protect his research. Owen, Claire, and the boys find Hoskins at the lab securing more embryos, but Delta breaks in and kills him. Owen restores his bond with the three surviving raptors before the Indominus reappears. The raptors attack the hybrid, but Delta and Echo are killed while Blue is knocked unconscious. Claire releases the Tyrannosaurus rex of Jurassic Park from its paddock and lures it to the Indominus. The dinosaurs attack each other, and the Indominus eventually overpowers the Tyrannosaurus, but Blue recovers and joins the battle. The duo fights the Indominus until it gets cornered at the lagoon's edge, where it is dragged underwater by the Mosasaurus. Owen and Blue part ways afterwards. The survivors are evacuated, and the island is abandoned once again. Zach and Gray reunite with their parents, while Owen and Claire decide to stay together.",

    "plot": "Structural engineer John Garrity lives in Atlanta, Georgia, with his estranged wife, Allison, and their diabetic son, Nathan. He is on the way home to watch the near-earth passing of a recently discovered interstellar comet nicknamed \"Clarke\", along with his family and neighbors. While at the supermarket, John receives an automated Department of Homeland Security (DHS) message announcing that he and his family have been selected for emergency sheltering. He returns home just as a comet fragment is seen entering the atmosphere on live television. Previously expected to land in the ocean near Bermuda, the fragment instead strikes Tampa, Florida, vaporizing the city along with most of the state. John then receives a call with instructions to head to Robins Air Force Base for an evacuation flight, as Clarke is on a direct collision course to Earth and the impact will cause an extinction-level event in two days. John, Allison, and Nathan pack up and drive away. The way to the base is clogged by heavy traffic, so the Garritys abandon their car and continue on foot. Nathan's insulin is accidentally left behind in the car. As they reach the base, John realizes it is missing and goes back to retrieve it. Meanwhile, Nathan's medical condition is discovered, disqualifying him for sheltering, and Allison stays with him. John returns and boards a plane but quickly jumps off upon realizing Allison and Nathan were left behind. As John exits the base, a panicked mob breaks in, destroying several evacuation planes when gunfire ignites spilled jet fuel. Returning to their car, John finds Allison's note saying they are going to her father's home in Lexington, Kentucky. After getting medical supplies, Allison and Nathan hitch a ride from Ralph and Judy Vento, only for Ralph to kidnap Nathan in order to use him and the wristbands to board a flight. John hitch-hikes a ride on a truck full of people heading towards Canada, planning to get off in Lexington. A passenger named Colin tells him they are headed to Osgoode, Ontario, where private planes are flying to Greenland, believed to be the military evacuation site. Another man attempts to steal John's wristband, causing the truck to crash, killing Colin. John is forced to kill the other man in self-defense. At another air force base, the Ventos attempt to pose as Nathan's parents, but are arrested when Nathan reveals he's not their child. Allison and Nathan are reunited shortly after at a nearby Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) camp. The following morning, John learns that the largest fragment will hit in approximately 24 hours. Stealing a car, John reaches his father-in-law, Dale's house, and Nathan and Allison arrive shortly after. The family learn about a complex of underground bunkers near Thule Air Base in Greenland, confirming that is where the evacuees are being sent. Dale chooses to stay behind, bidding farewell to his daughter's family. John, Allison and Nathan proceed in Dale's truck.

    "title": "Zack Snyder's Justice League",
    "plot": "Thousands of years ago, Apokoliptian warlord Darkseid and his Parademons attempt to invade Earth using the combined energies of three Mother Boxes to form \"The Unity\", a phenomenon which would instantly devastate Earth and terraform it into a copy of their homeworld. This would allow Darkseid to harvest the Anti-Life Equation, a secret power capable of controlling all sentient free will in the multiverse, from the planet unchallenged. Darkseid is foiled however by an alliance of the Old Gods, Amazons, Atlanteans, humanity, and extraterrestrial beings. The Mother Boxes are then separated and hidden in different locations. Millennia later, Superman's death following the battle with Doomsday reactivates the Boxes. This attracts Steppenwolf, Darkseid's disgraced lieutenant who seeks to regain his favor. Steppenwolf reaches Themyscira through a portal and fights to obtain the Amazons' Mother Box. Diana Prince informs Bruce Wayne, as the two seek to form a team of metahumans to protect the planet. After failing to recruit Arthur Curry, Bruce locates Barry Allen, who joins enthusiastically. Diana locates Victor Stone, who joins after his father, Silas, and other S.T.A.R. Labs employees are kidnapped by Parademons seeking humanity's Mother Box. Steppenwolf kills Atlantean guards and takes their Mother Box, forcing Arthur to join the group. Victor retrieves the last Mother Box, which he had hidden. He reveals his father used it to rebuild his body after a car accident, explaining that the Boxes can rearrange matter. The group realizes they could resurrect Superman using the Box. The team exhumes Clark Kent's body and places it in a Kryptonian ship. They successfully resurrect him, but Clark fails to remember who he is, so attacks the group. Lois Lane arrives and placates him, then they go together to Clark's family home in Smallville, allowing him to regain his memories. Steppenwolf retrieves the last Mother Box, but not before Victor's father sacrifices himself to supercharge it with laser heat, allowing Victor to track it. Without Superman, the five heroes travel to the abandoned Russian city Pozharnov, where Steppenwolf aims to form the Unity. The team fight their way through the surrounding Parademons, with Superman arriving in time to subdue Steppenwolf. However, Victor fails to prevent the Unity, so Earth begins to be destroyed. To reverse time in order to provide Victor the necessary charge, Barry enters the Speed Force, allowing him and Superman to prevent the Unity. Working together, the team kills Steppenwolf, but Darkseid vows to return to Earth for the Anti-Life Equation. In the aftermath, Bruce and Diana make plans to set up a base of operations for the newly formed alliance at the desolated Wayne Manor. Clark resumes his double life in Metropolis, with Lois implied to be pregnant with his child. Arthur meets with Nuidis Vulko and Mera before going to see his father, and Barry informs his erroneously convicted father in prison that he has acquired a job in Central City's police department. Victor is inspired by a message left by his father to realize his purpose in life. Later, Lex Luthor, who has escaped from Arkham Asylum, is visited on his yacht by Slade Wilson, to whom he reveals Batman's secret identity. At home, Bruce awakens from an apocalyptic dream of the future, in which he is amongst a resistance troop being hunted by a mind-controlled Superman. He receives a visit from the Martian Manhunter, who promises to help the Justice League prepare for Darkseid's return.",

    "title": "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2",
    "plot": "In 2014, Peter Quill, Gamora, Drax, Rocket, and Baby Groot are renowned as the Guardians of the Galaxy. High Priestess Ayesha of the Sovereign race has the Guardians protect valuable Anulax batteries from an Abilisk, an inter-dimensional monster, in exchange for Nebula, Gamora's estranged sister, who was caught attempting to steal the batteries. After Rocket steals the batteries for himself, the Sovereign attacks the Guardians' ship with a fleet of drones. A mysterious figure destroys the drones and the Guardians crash-land on nearby planet Berhert. The figure reveals himself as Ego, Quill's father, and he introduces Mantis, his naïve empath servant. Ego invites Quill, Gamora, and Drax to his home planet, while Rocket and Groot remain behind to repair the ship and watch Nebula. Ayesha hires Yondu Udonta and his crew, who have been exiled from the greater Ravager community by Ravager leader Stakar Ogord for child trafficking, to recapture the Guardians. They capture Rocket, but when Yondu hesitates to turn over Quill, whom he raised, his lieutenant Kraglin Obfonteri questions his objectivity, and Taserface, another lieutenant, leads a mutiny, aided by Nebula, who shoots Yondu. Taserface executes Yondu's loyalists, and imprisons him and Rocket aboard Yondu's ship. Nebula leaves to find and kill Gamora, whom she blames for the torture inflicted on her by Thanos, their adoptive father. Kraglin, who is remorseful and never signed up for a mutiny, helps Groot free Rocket and Yondu, and while escaping, the group set the ship to self-destruct using Yondu's arrow. Taserface informs the Sovereign before being killed by the explosion. Ego, a god-like Celestial that manipulated the matter around his consciousness to form his \"home\" planet, explains that he projected a humanoid guise to travel the universe and discover a purpose, eventually falling in love with Quill's mother Meredith. Ego hired Yondu to collect the young Quill after Meredith's death, but the boy was never delivered, and Ego has been searching for him ever since. He teaches Quill to manipulate his inherited Celestial power, while Mantis grows close to Drax and tries to warn him of Ego's plans. Nebula arrives at Ego's planet and tries to kill Gamora, but the pair reconcile and reach an uneasy alliance, soon discovering a cavern filled with skeletal remains. Ego brainwashes Quill and reveals that in his travels, he planted seedlings on thousands of worlds that can terraform into new extensions of himself, but only the power of two Celestials can activate them. He adds that he impregnated countless women and hired Yondu to collect their offspring but killed them all when they failed to inherit his Celestial power. When Ego admits that he gave Meredith the brain tumor that killed her, an infuriated Quill breaks out of his brainwashing and violently attacks him. Ego then parasitically draws Quill's energy to activate the seedlings, which begin to consume the worlds on which they are planted. Rocket, Yondu, Groot, and Kraglin arrive, and together with Mantis, Drax, Nebula and Gamora, they rescue Quill. The reunited Guardians travel to Ego's brain at the planet's core, where Yondu reveals that he kept Quill to spare him from Ego. As the Sovereign's drones return and attack, Rocket makes a bomb using the stolen batteries, which Groot plants on Ego's brain. Quill uses his newfound Celestial powers to fight Ego, distracting him long enough for the other Guardians and Mantis to escape. The bomb explodes, killing Ego and disintegrating the planet, but also draining Quill of his Celestial powers. Yondu sacrifices himself to save Quill by letting himself die in the vacuum of space. Despite having reconciled with Gamora, Nebula chooses to leave and resume her quest to kill Thanos. The Guardians, with Mantis as a new member, hold a funeral for Yondu as dozens of Ravager ships arrive, having heard of Yondu's sacrifice and accept him as a Ravager again. In a series of mid-and post-credit scenes, Kraglin takes up Yondu's telekinetic arrow and control-fin; Ogord reunites with his ex-teammates and fellow Ravager captains; Ayesha creates Adam, a new artificial being with whom she plans to destroy the Guardians; and Groot grows into a teenager.",

    "title": "Tron",
    "plot": "Kevin Flynn is a leading software engineer, formerly employed by large technology corporation ENCOM. He now runs a video game arcade, and attempts to hack into ENCOM's system with a program called CLU. However, ENCOM's Master Control Program (MCP) halts his progress and CLU is deleted. Within ENCOM, programmer Alan Bradley and his girlfriend, engineer Lora Baines, discover that the MCP has closed off their access to projects. When Alan confronts the senior executive vice president, Ed Dillinger, he asserts the security measures are an effort to stop outside hacking attempts. However, when Dillinger privately questions the MCP through his computerized desk, he realizes the MCP has expanded into a powerful virtual intelligence and has been illegally appropriating personal, business, and government programs to increase its own capabilities. As Dillinger rose to the top of ENCOM by presenting Flynn's games as his own, the MCP blackmails Dillinger by threatening to expose his plagiarism if he does not comply with its directives. Lora deduces that Flynn is the hacker, and she and Alan go to his arcade to warn him. Flynn reveals that he has been trying to locate evidence proving Dillinger's plagiarism. Together, the three form a plan to break into ENCOM and unlock Alan's \"Tron\" program, a self-governing security measure designed to protect the system and counter the functions of the MCP. Once inside ENCOM, the three split up, and Flynn comes into direct conflict with the MCP through a laboratory terminal. Before Flynn can get the information he needs, the MCP uses an experimental laser to digitize and upload him into the ENCOM gaming grid. There, computer programs are living entities appearing in the likeness of the human \"Users\" (programmers) who created them. The space is ruled by the MCP and its second-in-command, Sark, who coerce programs to renounce their belief in the Users and force those who resist to compete in deadly games. Flynn is put into the games and plays well; between matches, he befriends two other captured programs, Ram and Tron. The three escape into the system during a round of Light Cycle (an arcade game Flynn created and is skilled at), but Flynn and Ram become separated from Tron by an MCP pursuit party. While attempting to help a badly injured Ram, Flynn learns that he can manipulate portions of the system by accessing his programmer knowledge. Just before Ram \"derezzes\" (dies), he recognizes Flynn as a User, and encourages him to find Tron and free the system. Using his newfound ability, Flynn rebuilds a broken vehicle and disguises himself as one of Sark's soldiers. Tron enlists help from Yori, a sympathetic program, and at an I/O tower receives information from Alan necessary to destroy the MCP. Flynn rejoins them, and the three board a hijacked solar sailer to reach the MCP's core. However, Sark's command ship destroys the sailer, capturing Flynn and Yori and presumably killing Tron. Sark leaves the command ship and orders its deresolution, but Flynn keeps it intact by manipulating the system again. Sark reaches the MCP's core on a shuttle carrying captured programs deemed powerful or useful. While the MCP attempts to absorb these programs, Tron, who is still alive, confronts Sark and critically injures him, prompting the MCP to give Sark all its functions. Realizing that his ability to manipulate the system might give Tron an opening, Flynn leaps into the beam of the MCP, distracting it. Seeing a break in the MCP's shield, Tron attacks through the gap and destroys the MCP and Sark, ending the MCP's control over the system and allowing the captured programs to communicate with users again. Flynn reappears in the real world, rematerialized at the terminal. Tron's victory in the system has released all lockouts on computer access, and a nearby printer proves that Dillinger had plagiarized Flynn's creations. The next morning, Dillinger enters his office to find the MCP deactivated and the proof of his theft publicized. Flynn is subsequently promoted to CEO of ENCOM and is happily greeted by Alan and Lora as their new boss.",

    "plot": "After helping Bruce Wayne / Batman and Diana Prince / Wonder Woman stop a robbery in Gotham City, Barry Allen / The Flash revisits his childhood home, where he lived with his parents Nora and Henry, before Henry's wrongful imprisonment for Nora's murder. On the day of her death, Nora sent Henry to the grocery store for some canned food she forgot to buy, leaving her alone in the kitchen where she was killed by an unidentified assailant. Overcome by emotions, Barry accidentally uses the Speed Force to travel back in time to earlier that day. Returning to the present, he discusses the incident with Bruce, who warns of time travel's unintended consequences. Despite this, Barry travels to the day of Nora's death and places a can of food in Nora's grocery cart to prevent Henry from leaving the house. As he returns to the present, Barry is attacked by an unknown speedster and emerges in an alternate 2013 where Nora is alive. He encounters his parents and his past self, and realizes this is the day he was struck by lightning and obtained his powers. The two Barrys go to the Central City Police Department, where Barry reenacts the event so 2013-Barry can gain his powers. Both end up getting struck by the lightning, giving 2013-Barry powers, but causing Barry to lose his own. As Barry struggles to train his younger self on properly using his powers, the Barrys learn that General Zod is preparing to invade Earth. To fight Zod, the Barrys attempt to assemble the Justice League but are unsuccessful; in this timeline, Diana cannot be located, Victor Stone has not gained his abilities yet, and Arthur Curry never existed. They travel to Wayne Manor, hoping to find Bruce, but they instead find an alternate version who has long retired. Bruce theorizes that altering history via time travel affected events both before and after the alteration, which has also caused several realities to collapse into one. They convince Bruce to return as Batman and help them find Kal-El / Superman. The Barrys and Bruce locate a Kryptonian pod discovered in Siberia. Upon arrival, they instead find Kal-El's cousin, Kara Zor-El, imprisoned in the facility. They rescue Kara and return to Wayne Manor, where Barry enlists Bruce's help to regain his powers. The first two attempts fail, prompting Kara to fly Barry into a storm, where he regains his powers. Kara, Bruce and the Barrys fight Zod and his forces. Kara learns that Zod had intercepted Kal-El's escape pod from Krypton and, attempting to extract the Codex needed to repopulate the Kryptonian species, killed him. Zod reveals that the Codex is actually within Kara before subduing and killing her, extracting the Codex from her blood. Meanwhile, Bruce sacrifices himself in an unsuccessful attempt to destroy Zod's ship. The Barrys repeatedly time-travel to save Bruce and Kara, but keep failing. Barry realizes the sequence of events cannot be changed, but 2013-Barry keeps trying, which causes the multiverse to begin imploding. The unknown speedster who initially knocked Barry out of the Speed Force returns and is revealed to be an older, future version of 2013-Barry who still believes he can defeat Zod and save his Earth. Barry decides to reverse the changes he made to the timeline by letting Nora die. The elder 2013-Barry attempts to kill Barry to stop him, but young 2013-Barry sacrifices himself and is impaled instead, causing the elder 2013-Barry to fade from existence. Barry reverts the timeline and comes to terms with his mother's death; however, he subtly alters the past by moving the canned tomatoes to a higher shelf. Returning to the present day, Barry attends Henry's court hearing, where the security footage now reveals Henry looking up to grab the can, allowing for his exoneration. Barry is then contacted by Bruce, whose appearance has changed once again due to the timeline alteration.",

Years later, a teenage Peter attends Midtown Science High School; he is intelligent but socially awkward and often bullied. He has a crush on Gwen Stacy, who returns his feelings. Peter discovers his father's briefcase and learns from Ben that his father was friends with Dr. Curt Connors, a scientist at Oscorp in the field of cross-species genetics. Peter sneaks into a restricted laboratory at Oscorp, where a genetically modified spider bites him. He develops spider-like abilities, specifically superhuman strength, sharp senses, agility, speed, and the ability to cling to objects. Connors, whose right arm has been amputated, is conducting experiments to regenerate limbs. Discovering the missing piece to Connors' experiments in his father's papers, the \"decay rate algorithm\", Peter visits Connors, reveals that he is Richard's son, and gives Connors the algorithm. At home, Peter and Ben argue, and Peter leaves. While searching for him, Ben tries stopping a thief that Peter allowed to escape, is shot, and dies in Peter's arms. Under the alias Spider-Man, Peter uses his new abilities to track down criminals matching the killer's description, particularly a star tattoo on his wrist. He creates a mask with yellow-tinted glasses and a spandex suit to hide his identity, and builds mechanical web-shooters using a web formula developed by Oscorp. At dinner with Gwen's family, he discovers her father is police captain George Stacy, who holds a grudge against Spider-Man. Peter reveals his double identity to Gwen, and they kiss. After seeing success with the lab rats using lizard DNA, Connors' superior Rajit Ratha demands that Connors begin human trials. However, Connors refuses to rush the drug-testing procedure and put innocent people at risk. Ratha fires him and decides to test his serum at a Veterans Administration hospital. Desperate, Connors tries the formula on himself, passes out, and awakens to find that his missing arm has regenerated. Connors turns into a humanoid reptilian monster while trying to intercept Ratha and attacks people on the Williamsburg Bridge. Peter saves the people from Connors' attack. Unable to piece together a narrative for the incident, the police issue a city-wide manhunt for both the Lizard and Spider-Man.

The Lizard discovers Spider-Man's true identity via a camera with Peter's name on it, and he attacks Peter at his school.

The police corner Spider-Man. George discovers that Spider-Man is Peter, and releases him to stop Connors. Gwen creates an aerosolized antidote, and while George occupies Connors in battle, Peter disperses it into the city, curing Connors and his victims. Dying from wounds inflicted by Connors, George asks Peter to stay away from Gwen to keep her safe. Peter does so but realizes they are both unhappy, hinting to her that he may not keep his promise.

While he watches the 2022 FIFA World Cup final, soldiers from the year 2051 arrive through a time portal to warn that humanity is on the brink of extinction due to alien invaders: the Whitespikes. In response, the world's military forces are sent to the future, but less than 20% manage to survive, prompting a global draft. Dan receives the draft and is fitted with an electronic vambrace that tracks him. Dan's wife Emmy asks him to remove the vambrace with the help of his estranged father, James Forester, but Dan becomes angry with him for abandoning him in his childhood and leaves without removing the vambrace. Dan and the draftees are sent to Miami Beach, Florida, in the future, but few survive, having been dropped at the wrong coordinates, high above the city. Romeo Command orders the remaining recruits to rescue the staff from the nearby laboratory. The team discovers the lab staff dead, but recovers their research before the area is bombed. Dan and the survivors make it back to a military camp in Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic, where Dan learns that Romeo Command is actually his daughter, Colonel Muri Forester. She asks him to accompany her on a mission to capture one of the female Whitespikes, which are rarer than the males. They find and capture the female, only to have the Whitespike males descend on her position. Muri finally reveals to Dan that in the past, he became disillusioned after failing to secure his research job, which led to his divorce and abandonment of his family, just as James had done to him as a child. He then died in a car crash when she was 16. Dan and Muri find themselves transported to the Jumplink, which is situated on a fortified oil platform in the middle of the ocean. They work on a toxin that targets the female, but the Whitespikes launch an attack on the base. Muri is severely injured and asks Dan to take the toxin to the past, expressing that humanity was never going to survive in this timeline. They reconcile, and Dan successfully returns to the past with the toxin to mass-produce it. He attempts to deliver it to the military so it can be sent back to the future, but discovers that the Jumplink is offline, having been destroyed by the Whitespikes. After explaining to his wife what happened in the future, they deduce that the Whitespikes did not arrive in 2048, but much earlier. Dan and Dorian investigate the Whitespike's claw with Charlie and discover fragments of volcanic ash from a volcano in the Changbai Mountains during the Millennium Eruption. They theorize that Whitespikes were already on Earth and global warming caused their release when they thawed and emerged from beneath the polar caps. He turns to the military for aid, but they cannot support him without proof. He asks his father to transport an eight-man team. Dan leads a mission to Severnaya Zemlya in northern Russia to test his theory, and finds an alien ship in an ice sheet. Once inside, they realize that the alien ship is not actually a Whitespike ship, and that the Whitespikes were cargo for the deceased alien crew. They inject the toxin into the dormant Whitespikes, killing those injected, but it awakens the remaining Whitespikes. Dorian and Hart decide to sacrifice themselves by manually detonating the alien ship once they realize it is the only method of containment, but the female manages to escape. Dan and his father track down the female and manage to kill her, preventing the future war from occurring. Dan reunites with his daughter and introduces her to her grandfather.",

While on a fishing trip, Tom advises Sonic to remain patient for the day his powers will be needed before he and Maddie depart for her sister Rachel's wedding in Hawaii, leaving Sonic in charge of the house for the weekend. While staying at home, Sonic is attacked by Robotnik, who has escaped with the help of Knuckles, an echidna warrior, and returned to Earth for revenge on Sonic. Knuckles demands the location of the legendary Master Emerald—an ancient relic that grants its user ultimate power and the ability to change reality to their will—so he can bring honor to his ancestors. Sonic is rescued by Miles \"Tails\" Prower, a young two-tailed fox who idolizes him and has come to warn him about Knuckles. Sonic convinces Tails to help him find the Master Emerald while Robotnik reunites with his assistant, Agent Stone, and offers to \"help\" Knuckles, scheming to steal the emerald. Following clues on a map given to Sonic by his late former guardian, Longclaw, Sonic and Tails find a compass within a temple in Siberia. Knuckles and Robotnik track them and chase Sonic and Tails down a mountain. Knuckles reveals that he lost his whole tribe the same day Sonic lost Longclaw. Despite this brief moment of sympathy, Knuckles and Robotnik steal the compass. However, Knuckles grows suspicious of Robotnik's sense of loyalty and honor when he mocks Sonic for choosing to save an injured and unconscious Tails instead of the compass before an avalanche starts upon them. Tom saves Sonic and Tails from an avalanche by using a ring to teleport them to the wedding. Rachel's fiancé Randall and his wedding guests reveal themselves as undercover agents of the Guardian Units of Nations (G.U.N.), having set the wedding up to capture Sonic and Tails; they ultimately also arrest Tom when he tries to stop them. The trio are saved by Maddie and a vengeful Rachel, who reconciles with Randall after he confirms that his feelings for her are real. Meanwhile, Knuckles and Robotnik find an underwater temple containing the Master Emerald. Blaming himself for Tails' injuries, Sonic decides to face Knuckles and Robotnik alone and goes to the temple, where he fights Knuckles to keep him from taking the Master Emerald. Robotnik exploits the distraction and seizes the emerald, which collapses the temple, sinking it into the water. No longer needing Knuckles, Robotnik betrays him and leaves both him and Sonic behind. Teaming up after rescuing one another from the flood, Sonic and Knuckles manage to escape just as a recovered Tails rescues them in a biplane. In Green Hills, Robotnik uses his new abilities from the emerald to create a giant robot resembling himself. Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles work together to fight the robot and its accompanying drones and reclaim the Master Emerald. The emerald shatters in Sonic's hands, splitting into the seven Chaos Emeralds. Tom and Maddie save Sonic, who inadvertently uses the Chaos Emeralds to transform into Super Sonic. He destroys the robot, allowing Robotnik to collapse with it, before dispersing the Emeralds and reverting to normal.

    "plot": "Nineteen-year-old Alice Kingsleigh, having mourned the recent loss of her father, is troubled by strange recurring dreams and the stifling expectations of the society in which she lives. After receiving an unwanted marriage proposal from Hamish Ascot at his father's British garden party, Alice spots a familiar white rabbit wearing a waistcoat and carrying a pocket watch. She follows it to a rabbit hole and falls in instead. She shrinks after drinking from a bottle labeled 'Drink Me' (called a Pishsalver), meaning she cannot reach a key on a table, and then eats a cake labeled 'Eat Me' (called an Upelkuchen), transformed into a giantess. After drinking from the bottle again to fit through a tiny door, she enters the forest of a fantastical world called Underland. There, she is greeted by the White Rabbit, a Dormouse, a Dodo, Talking Flowers, and identical twins Tweedledum and Tweedledee, who all apparently know her. Alice asserts that she is dreaming, but learns from Absolem the Caterpillar that she is destined to slay the Jabberwocky and end the tyranny of the Red Queen. The group is ambushed by the ravenous Bandersnatch and the Red Queen's knights, led by the Knave of Hearts. All are captured except Alice, who escapes, and the Dormouse who takes one of the Bandersnatch's eyes. The Knave informs the Red Queen of Alice's return, and is ordered to find her immediately. The Cheshire Cat guides Alice to the Mad Hatter, March Hare, and Dormouse's tea party. The Red Knights and the Knave of Hearts disrupt the party, but Alice manages to hide in a teapot. The Hatter then takes her to a safe place. He explains that the Red Queen took over Underland, usurping her sister, the White Queen. While in the woods, the Red Knights find the two, but the Hatter gives himself up so that Alice can escape. She is found by the Knave's Bloodhound, named Bayard, who is allied with the resistance. He takes Alice to the Red Queen's castle, where she becomes a giant again after eating another Upelkuchen. Infiltrating the palace as a courtier named \"Um\", Alice learns that the vorpal sword, the only weapon capable of killing the Jabberwocky, is locked inside the Bandersnatch's den. The Knave makes a pass at Alice, which she rebuffs, but the jealous Red Queen orders her beheading. Alice obtains the sword and returns the Bandersnatch's eye. He gratefully helps her escape the castle and delivers her to the White Queen, who gives Alice a potion that returns her normal size. The Cheshire Cat uses his shapeshifting powers to free the Mad Hatter, who incites rebellion amongst the Red Queen's subjects. Meanwhile, Absolem, who is turning into a pupa, finally gets Alice to remember that she visited Underland when she was a little girl, and called it \"Wonderland\". Just before his chrysalis closes, he advises her to fight the Jabberwocky, save Underland, and stop the Red Queen for good. The Queens gather their armies on a chessboard-like battlefield and send Alice and the Jabberwocky to decide the battle in single combat. The battle ends when Alice beheads the Jabberwocky with the vorpal sword, and the red knights gratefully turn against their ruler. The White Queen banishes her sister and the Knave into exile together, then gives Alice a vial of the Jabberwocky's purple blood, which can fulfill one wish. Alice says farewell to her friends, then wishes to return home. Alice awakens in the rabbit hole. When she returns to the gazebo at the garden party, she refuses Hamish's proposal and impresses Lord Ascot with her idea of establishing trade routes to Hong Kong, her father's original idea, inspiring him to take her on as his apprentice. As Alice prepares to set off on a trading ship, Absolem, in his new butterfly form, lands on her shoulder.",

Meanwhile, David Kane / Black Manta continues to seek revenge against Arthur for his father's death, working with marine biologist Stephen Shin to find Atlantean artifacts. When Shin accidentally discovers a cavern in Antarctica, Manta finds a Black Trident that possesses him, its creator promising to give him the power to destroy Arthur and Atlantis. Five months later, Manta breaks into an Orichalcum reserve on Atlantis to steal them to power his Atlantean machines that are of ancient origin but are of unknown design to modern Atlanteans. Caught midway, they are chased by Atlantean forces, with Mera injured in the ensuing battle. Arthur learns that this usage of Orichalcum, which emits high quantities of greenhouse gases, has not only raised planetary temperatures and caused extreme weather and ocean acidification. It also nearly caused a planetary extinction in the past, when used by an ancient Atlantean kingdom. To learn where Manta is hiding, Arthur breaks his half-brother Orm out of prison. Together, they visit a pirate haven called the Sunken Citadel, meeting Kingfish to learn of Manta's whereabouts. The information they obtain leads them to a volcanic island in the South Pacific, where they battle Manta's forces after getting themselves through flora and fauna mutated by the Orichalcum. There, when Orm touches the Black Trident, it shows him visions of its provenance. Orm learns the trident was created by Kordax, the brother of King Atlan and ruler of the lost kingdom of Necrus. He was imprisoned with blood magic following a failed attempt to usurp the throne. Realizing the blood of any of Atlan's descendants could release Kordax; the pair deduce Manta has kidnapped Arthur Jr. With Shin's help, the Atlanteans determine that Kordax's prison and the lost kingdom of Necrus are located in Antarctica. In Necrus, Arthur fights Manta and is almost killed before Mera arrives and saves him. Manta throws the Black Trident at her as she is taking her son to safety, but Orm catches it before it strikes her. The spirit of Kordax leaves Manta for Orm, who proceeds to fight Arthur and uses Arthur's blood to free Kordax. Arthur convinces his brother to give up his hatred for him, allowing him to destroy both Kordax and the Black Trident. With Kordax's magic vanishing, Necrus starts to collapse. Manta refuses Arthur's help, allowing himself to fall into a fissure. The Atlanteans and Shin safely escape and determine that Orm has redeemed himself. Arthur and Mera plan to inform Atlantis that he died on the condition that he remains hidden, vacating to the surface world. Believing the unification of the underwater kingdoms and the surface world is necessary to prevent further damage to the oceans and planet, Arthur reveals Atlantis' existence through an announcement at the United Nations, declaring his intentions of making the kingdom a member state.",

    "plot": "A drop of sunlight falls from the sky and produces a magic flower with healing properties. For centuries, Gothel uses the flower to retain her youth, until it is stolen by soldiers from the kingdom of Corona and used to save their ill, pregnant queen. She gives birth to Rapunzel, whose blonde hair contains the flower's magic. Gothel sneaks into the castle and cuts a lock of her hair, but it turns brown and loses its magic. She then abducts Rapunzel and raises her in a hidden tower in the woods, keeping Rapunzel's magic for herself. Each year on Rapunzel's birthday, the king and queen release sky lanterns, hoping they will guide Rapunzel home. Rapunzel is fascinated by the annual lights and, on her 18th birthday, asks to leave the tower and investigate them, but Gothel refuses, claiming the outside world is too dangerous. Meanwhile, Flynn Rider steals Rapunzel's intended crown from the palace; he betrays the Stabbington brothers, his partners in crime, while being pursued by royal guard-horse Maximus. Flynn discovers and takes refuge in the tower, where Rapunzel knocks him out and hides him. When Gothel berates Rapunzel for mentioning the lanterns again and refuses to let her ever leave the tower, Rapunzel hatches a new plan and asks Gothel for new paint as a gift, sending her on a three-day journey. After hiding Flynn's satchel containing the crown, Rapunzel strikes a deal with Flynn, promising to return the crown in exchange for taking her to see the lanterns. Outdoors for the first time since infanthood, Rapunzel experiences conflicting feelings of excitement and guilt. Flynn takes Rapunzel to the Snuggly Duckling pub, where thugs try to capture the wanted Flynn, but Rapunzel charms them into revealing their softer sides. When royal guards arrive, the thugs help Rapunzel and Flynn escape. Flynn and Rapunzel become trapped in a fast-flooding cave; believing they will suffocate, Flynn reveals his true name, Eugene Fitzherbert. Rapunzel uses the magic glow of her hair to reveal a hidden underwater exit, and they escape. Meanwhile, Gothel returns to the empty tower and finds the satchel with the crown and a wanted poster of Eugene. Inspired by the discovery, Gothel finds the Stabbington brothers and strikes a deal with them to find Rapunzel. That night, Gothel confronts Rapunzel alone and gives her the satchel, telling her to give it to Eugene to test his loyalty. The next morning, Maximus tracks down Eugene and attempts to arrest him, but Rapunzel convinces them to strike a truce. Rapunzel and Eugene enter the kingdom and attend a festival in honor of the \"lost princess\". After a day of celebration, they sail onto the lake to watch the release of the lanterns. Rapunzel gives Eugene the crown, and they confess their mutual love. When Eugene sees the Stabbingtons on the shore, he goes to apologize and offers them the crown. The brothers tie him up, tricking Rapunzel into thinking he abandoned her. They try to capture Rapunzel, but Gothel stages a rescue by knocking them out and takes Rapunzel back to the tower. Eugene is arrested, but Maximus and the pub thugs help him escape. Meanwhile, Rapunzel realizes she has subconsciously incorporated the kingdom's standard, a golden sun, into her artwork throughout her life. Realizing that she is the \"lost princess\", Rapunzel confronts and rebels against Gothel. Eugene arrives at the tower, but is tricked and stabbed by Gothel with her dagger. Gothel attempts to take the chained and gagged Rapunzel away, but she resists, and promises to stay with Gothel if she is allowed to heal the dying Eugene. Gothel reluctantly agrees, but Eugene, realizing Rapunzel would spend the rest of her life in captivity, cuts off her long hair before she can heal him. Rapunzel's hair turns brown, and a horrified Gothel suddenly ages rapidly before falling from the tower to her death, turning to dust in the process, while Eugene apparently dies in Rapunzel's arms. Rapunzel mourns Eugene, but one of her tears, which still has some of the flower's magic, revives him. Rapunzel and Eugene return to Corona, where Rapunzel is reunited with her birth parents, Eugene is pardoned for his crimes, and the kingdom celebrates. Rapunzel and Eugene eventually marry.",

    "plot": "In Brazil, a satellite that had fallen out of orbit crashes on NSA Agent Augustus Gibbons who is attempting to recruit footballer Neymar for the Triple-X (xXx) program, seemingly killing them both. In New York City, a team led by Xiang infiltrates a highly guarded CIA office and retrieve \"Pandora's Box\", a device capable of controlling satellites to crash at specific locations as warheads. CIA Agent Jane Marke tracks down former xXx operative Xander Cage, who faked his death and has been living in self-imposed exile in the Dominican Republic. Marke convinces Xander to return to active service to retrieve the device. In London, after enlisting his old friend Ainsley for help, Xander tracks down the attackers to the Philippines. At an RAF outpost in Lakenheath, a unit of Special Forces operatives led by Paul Donovan is assigned to help Xander. He rejects them in favor of his own team, composed of sharpshooter Adele Wolff, DJ Harvard \"Nicks\" Zhou, getaway driver Tennyson \"The Torch,\" and weapons specialist Becky Clearidge. The team locates Xiang and his teammates Serena, Talon and Hawk. Xander meets Xiang in an underground nightclub on a remote island, where Xiang reveals that his team are also xXx agents, recruited by Gibbons. Xiang claims to have stolen Pandora's Box to prevent its misuse, although Serena believes they should destroy it. Shortly after, Russian soldiers raid the island. The group fends off the attackers, while Xiang escapes with the device. Xander chases him to a nearby beach. Serena betrays Xiang, destroys the Box, and joins Xander's team, while Xiang escapes and regroups with Talon and Hawk. After another satellite crash in the Olympic Stadium in Moscow, Marke determines that the device that Serena destroyed was only a prototype. Xander discovers CIA Director Anderson is involved and possesses the actual Pandora's Box. Xander's and Xiang's teams race to reach Anderson first in Detroit, tracking the unique signal emitted by Pandora's Box, with Xander and Xiang reluctantly cooperate to fight Anderson's men. Xander confronts Anderson, who admits to causing the satellite crash that killed Gibbons before Wolff shoots him dead. Xander reluctantly allows the CIA to arrest Xiang in an attempt to frame him for the Moscow attack, and they secure the box. En route back to headquarters, Marke announces the program has been shuttered and shoots Xander to keep it for herself. She then sends a group of assassins to eliminate the others, who are awaiting extraction at a local NSA warehouse. They join forces to fend off their attackers, assisted by former xXx operative Darius Stone. Xander, having survived thanks to a bulletproof vest provided by Becky, joins forces with Xiang to fight Donovan and his men, while Marke uses the box to send a satellite plummeting towards the warehouse where the teams are fighting, aiming to kill both groups. Donovan breaks out a pair of bionic gloves and starts punching all the equipment aboard as Xander dodges the punches. During a scuffle in the bathroom, Donovan punches the toilet, creating an opening through which Xander ejects him, while Xiang sends Marke falling to her death and then parachutes out with the box in hand. After notification from Serena about Becky's unsuccessful attempts to halt the signal, Xander, in a final attempt to protect them, maneuvers the plane into the approaching satellite before it reaches the warehouse and jumps out, landing safely via the cargo load. Once at the bottom, Xiang gives him the device, who decides to permanently destroy it by stomping on it. After Xander and Serena kiss each other, Darius arrives in Xander's old car, and the two men introduce themselves to each other. The team attends Gibbons' funeral, where Xander is approached by Gibbons himself, who faked his death and is now rebuilding the program on his own, starting with Neymar as the newest recruit. Gibbons compliments Xander, who decides to continue in service.",

Although the two are initially nervous, they become smitten and fall in love instantly when they meet; however, the nervous Victor ruins their wedding rehearsal by forgetting his vows, dropping the ring, and accidentally setting Lady Everglot's dress on fire. Fleeing to a nearby forest, he successfully rehearses his vows with a tree and places his wedding ring on what appears to be an upturned root. However, the \"root\" is revealed to be the skeletal finger of a deceased woman named Emily, who, gowned in a wedding dress, rises from the grave and proclaims herself as Victor's new wife. She spirits themselves away to the Land of the Dead, a colorful and whimsical realm in which the spirits of the deceased reside. During his time with Emily, Victor learns that she was murdered years earlier on the night of her elopement by her fiancé, who stole the family jewels and gold she had brought (\"Remains of the Day\"). Emily reunites Victor with his long-dead dog, Scraps, and they bond. However, desperate to return to Victoria, Victor tricks Emily into returning them to the Land of the Living by claiming he wants her to meet his parents. Emily brings Victor to see Elder Gutknecht, the kindly ruler of the underworld, who grants them temporary passage. Victor reunites with Victoria and confesses his wish to marry her as soon as possible. Before the pair can share a kiss, Emily discovers them and drags Victor back to the Land of the Dead, feeling betrayed and hurt (\"Tears to Shed\"). Victoria tries to tell her parents and the village pastor of Victor's situation, but nobody believes her. Assuming Victor has left her, Victoria's parents decide to marry her against her will to Lord Barkis Bittern, a presumed-wealthy visitor who appeared at the wedding rehearsal. After reconciling with Emily, Victor learns of Victoria's impending marriage to Barkis from his family's newly deceased coachman Mayhew. Upset over this news, Victor decides to marry Emily properly after overhearing Elder Gutknecht tell Emily that due to Victor still being alive while she's dead, her accidental marriage to Victor is nullified by default, knowing that this will require him to repeat his wedding vows with her in the Land of the Living and drink the Wine of Ages, a poison, in order to join Emily in death. The dead swiftly prepare for the ceremony and head \"upstairs\" (\"The Wedding Song\"), where the village erupts into a temporary panic upon their arrival until the living recognize their departed loved ones and joyously reunite with them. The chaos causes a panicked Barkis to expose his own poor financial standing and his intentions to marry Victoria only for her supposed wealth, leading her to reject him. Victoria witnesses Victor and Emily's wedding as Victor completes his vows and prepares to drink the poison, only for Emily to stop him when she realizes she is denying Victoria her chance to live happily with him. Just as Emily reunites Victor and Victoria, Barkis arrives to kidnap Victoria; Emily recognizes Barkis as both her previous fiancé and murderer. Victor duels with Barkis to protect Victoria, and Emily intervenes to save Victor's life. Accepting defeat, Barkis mockingly toasts Emily for dying unwed and unwittingly drinks the poison, causing him to die, which widows Victoria and allows the dead – who cannot interfere in the affairs of the living – to take retribution against him for his crimes. Emily, now freed from her torment, releases Victor of his vow to marry her and returns his ring, allowing him to marry Victoria. As she steps into the moonlight, she transforms into a swarm of butterflies that fly into the sky as Victor and Victoria watch and embrace, happily knowing Emily has finally found eternal peace.",

During the ceremony, Maxime reveals he has enhanced himself with cockroach body parts, and Gru has him arrested by the AVL. Helped by his girlfriend Valentina, Maxime escapes prison to get revenge on Gru and reveals his new invention, a gun that transforms people into cockroach hybrids, which he plans to use specifically on Gru's infant son Gru Jr. Days later, Silas Ramsbottom visits the Gru household to inform them that Maxime has escaped and that the AVL will have to temporarily relocate the family to a safe house in another town under new identities. Meanwhile, the AVL takes in the Minions, and Silas selects five of them to be augmented with superpowers under a new initiative called the Mega Minions. However, the initiative is called off after the group unintentionally causes significant collateral damage in a nearby city. In their new well-off residential town, Gru and his family meet their new neighbors, the Prescotts, and their teenage daughter Poppy. Poppy, an aspiring villain, recognizes Gru from his former career as a villain and threatens to blow his cover unless he helps her pull a heist to steal Lycée Pas Bon's honey badger mascot Lenny. With the help of two minions and Gru Jr., they successfully steal Lenny from the school, unaware that Lenny's collar contains a tracker device. The school's principal Übelschlecht identifies Gru via security camera footage and contacts Maxime to inform him about Gru's whereabouts using Lenny's collar. The next day, while Gru and Lucy are away at tennis practice with Poppy's parents Perry and Patsy, leaving the girls and Poppy to watch over Gru Jr., Übelschlecht visits the safe house to interrogate them about Gru, which makes Poppy promptly leave carrying Lenny. Gru and Lucy then rush back home after being alerted by Margo and they all fight Übelschlecht. Lucy also signals the AVL who calls the Mega Minions out of retirement to stop Maxime. In the havoc, however, Gru Jr. leaves the house and is spotted by Maxime and Valentina, who kidnap him. Lucy and the girls stay behind to handle Übelschlecht as Gru decides to save his son with help from Poppy.

While searching for an old well, she meets a black cat and the landlady's grandson Wyborn \"Wybie\" Lovat, who gives her a rag doll that eerily resembles her. Since her parents are busy with work, Coraline entertains herself by exploring the house, discovering a small door with a brick wall behind it in the living room. That night, she opens the door and finds that the brick wall has been replaced by a tunnel, which leads her to an \"Other World\", where button-eyed doppelgängers of her parents lavish her with delicious food and their attention. Upon waking in the morning, Coraline finds herself back in the real world, where Wybie recounts that his great-aunt disappeared when she was a child. Coraline then meets her neighbors: Mr. Bobinsky, an eccentric Chernobyl liquidator-turned-gymnast who owns a mouse circus, and retired burlesque actresses April Spink and Miriam Forcible, who warn her of impeding danger in her future after a tea leaf reading. Coraline returns to the Other World that night, where she meets Wybie's mute doppelgänger. When she returns yet again, the cat, who can travel between the worlds, arrives and warns her about the Other World. The Other Mother offers for Coraline to stay in the Other World forever, on the condition of having buttons sewn onto her eyes. Horrified, Coraline desperately tries to return home, but she remains in the Other World. When Coraline tries to escape through the door, the Other Mother imprisons her in a dark room through a mirror. There, three ghost children, one of whom Coraline recognizes as Wybie's great-aunt, tell Coraline that the Other Mother is an evil entity called the \"Beldam\", who used rag dolls to spy on their unhappy lives and lure them into the Other World. They allowed her to sew buttons over their eyes and she subsequently robbed them of their souls. After Coraline promises to help the ghost children by retrieving their \"eyes\", the Other Wybie helps her escape through the passageway home. Back in the real world, Wybie asks Coraline to return the doll, since it belonged to his great-aunt. She attempts to explain the situation to him, but he disbelieves her and runs out in fear. Coraline receives an adder stone from Spink and Forcible and, after the cat informs her that the Beldam has kidnapped her parents, the duo set out to rescue them. Knowing that the Beldam has a penchant for games, Coraline proposes a deal: if she finds her parents and the eyes of the ghost children, the Beldam will let them all go; if not, she will stay and accept the Beldam's offer. As Coraline finds and collects each of the missing eyes using the adder stone, she frees the spirits of the ghost children and the Other World begins to fade until all three are collected and the entire dimension, except for the living room, eventually disintegrates. The Beldam, now in her arachnid-like true form, challenges Coraline to find her parents. Realizing they are trapped in a nearby snow globe and that the Beldam will not honor her end of the deal, she throws the cat to distract her before seizing the snow globe and narrowly escaping through the door with the ghost children's help, amputating one of the Beldam's hands in the process. Coraline's parents return with no recollection of their capture and she warmly embraces them. Later, the ghosts warn Coraline that the Beldam is still after the door's key.

    "plot": "A storm causes a Universal Dynamics cargo ship to lose six ROZZUM robots, which wash up on an uninhabited island; only Unit 7134 survives and is accidentally activated by wildlife. \"Roz\" is called a monster by the frightened wildlife and injures herself while trying to help them, even after learning how to communicate with all animals. Unable to find anyone needing her services, she signals for retrieval but is struck by lightning and attacked by animals. While fleeing from Thorn, an aggressive grizzly bear, Roz accidentally crushes a goose nest, resulting in the death of all but one egg. Roz protects the egg from a hungry red fox, Fink. A gosling hatches, imprints on Roz, and accidentally breaks her long-range transponder. Pinktail, a mother opossum, \"provides\" Roz with the task of caring for the gosling to ensure he can fly, swim, and eat by himself before the winter migration. Fink discovers he can benefit from Roz, who builds a shelter. Roz names the gosling Brightbill, and the three cohabit. As Brightbill grows up, he is rejected by other geese and, upon discovering that Roz accidentally killed his family, feels betrayed and angrily disowns her. Roz reconstructs ROZZUM unit 6262, nicknames her \"Rummage\", and asks for advice; Rummage gives her transponder to Roz, advising her to return to the Universal Dynamics factory. Roz enlists the help of a falcon, Thunderbolt, to help Brightbill learn to fly and receives advice from Longneck, a leader for the geese's migration, allowing Brightbill to master flying just in time to join the migration. Roz, missing Brightbill and unsure of her continued purpose, reactivates her transponder but shuts it off immediately after Universal Dynamics detects her signal. During the migration, a thunderstorm forces the geese to shelter inside a Universal Dynamics greenhouse, triggering a contamination alert that sets reconnaissance (RECO) robots after them. Longneck sacrifices himself so Brightbill can lead the flock to safety. Meanwhile, Roz and Fink save the island's animals during a severe snowstorm, urging them to a truce before Roz powers down. Spring arrives and Roz reawakens to find the animals still following the truce and Brightbill returning, hailed now as a hero. Shortly after, a Universal Dynamics dropship captained by a Virtual Observational Neutralizing Troublesome Retrieval Authority (\"Vontra\") robot arrives to recover Roz. Roz flees with Fink, pursued by RECO robots dispatched by Vontra. The animals band together to fight off the RECOs, but Vontra detonates the damaged RECOs to incapacitate and capture Roz, starting a forest fire in the process. The geese and Thunderbolt attack the dropship so Brightbill can save Roz as Fink and the others extinguish the fire. Despite Roz appearing to have been shut down by Vontra, her love for Brightbill restores her systems. Roz eventually destroys Vontra and evacuates Brightbill as the dropship explodes. Roz decides to return to Universal Dynamics to protect the island from future attacks, but she promises to return. The animals continue to live together on the island while Roz works at another Universal Dynamics greenhouse, maintaining her memories. Brightbill visits her, and the two embrace.",

Jack Skellington, the well-respected Pumpkin King, leads the town in organizing its annual celebrations. This year however, Jack grows tired of the same routine and longs for something new. Upon discovering trees containing doors to other holiday-themed worlds, Jack stumbles through the one leading to Christmas Town and is fascinated by the unfamiliar holiday. Jack returns home and shares his discovery with his friends and neighbors, but they struggle to grasp the concept of Christmas, although they relate to its ruler, Santa Claus, or \"Sandy Claws\" as Jack mistakenly dubs him. After several futile attempts at finding a way to rationally explain Christmas, Jack decides to \"improve\" the holiday instead. He announces that Halloween Town will take over Christmas this year and assigns Christmas-themed jobs, such as singing carols, making presents and building a sleigh pulled by skeletal reindeer, to various residents. Sally, the feminine creation of local mad scientist Doctor Finkelstein, experiences a vision predicting that their efforts will end disastrously. Jack, whom she secretly loves, dismisses her warnings and instructs her to make a Santa Claus suit for him. He tasks mischievous trick-or-treating trio Lock, Shock and Barrel with abducting Santa; however, he orders them not to involve their superior Oogie Boogie, a bogeyman with a passion for gambling and Jack's long-time rival, in their plot. When Lock, Shock and Barrel bring Santa to Halloween Town, Jack tells him that he will take care of Christmas this year and orders the trio to keep Santa safe. However, they disobey Jack's orders and bring Santa to Oogie, who plots to play a game with Santa's life at stake. As Jack departs to deliver presents in the real world, Sally, after failing to stop him beforehand, attempts to rescue Santa from Oogie, only to be captured herself. Jack's presents terrify the real world's populace, who contact the local authorities and are instructed to lock down their homes for protection. The military is alerted and Jack is shot out of the sky, leading Halloween Town's populace to believe he is dead. It is revealed that he survived and has crashed into a nearby cemetery. Bemoaning the trouble that he has caused, Jack realizes he nonetheless enjoyed the experience and that it gave him new ideas for celebrating Halloween, reigniting his love for the holiday. Upon returning home, Jack rescues Santa and Sally, confronts Oogie and defeats him by unraveling a thread holding his cloth form together, causing all of the insects inside Oogie to spill out and reduce him to nothing. Though displeased with Jack for his foolish actions and not listening to Sally earlier, Santa makes amends with him and resumes his yearly duties, replacing Jack's presents with genuine ones and saving Christmas. All of Halloween Town celebrates Jack's return. Santa brings a snowfall to the town, thereby bringing the Christmas spirit upon it, while Jack and Sally finally declare their love for each other.",

    "title": "Ratatouille",
    "plot": "Remy, a young rat with heightened senses of taste and smell, dreams of becoming a chef like his human idol, the late Auguste Gusteau. Conversely, the rest of his colony, including his older brother Émile and their father, Django, the clan leader, only eat for sustenance and are wary of humans. The rats live in an elderly woman's attic outside Paris, but when the woman discovers them, Remy becomes separated from the others during their hasty evacuation. Encouraged by an imaginary Gusteau, he explores until he finds himself on the roof of Gusteau's namesake restaurant. Remy sees the restaurant's new garbage boy, Alfredo Linguini, struggling to fix a leek soup he ruined and steps in to help. Linguini notices Remy but keeps his presence secret from Skinner, Gusteau's former sous-chef and the restaurant's new owner and head chef. Skinner confronts Linguini about the soup, but it is served by accident and unexpectedly becomes a hit. Colette Tatou, the restaurant's only female chef, persuades Skinner to keep Linguini and support Gusteau's motto, \"Anyone can cook.\" Skinner demands Linguini replicate the soup but spots Remy, ordering Linguini to take him outside and kill him. Alone, Linguini realizes Remy understands him and persuades Remy to assist with cooking. Remy controls Linguini's movements like a marionette by pulling on his hair while hiding under his toque. They recreate the soup and continue cooking at the restaurant. Colette begrudgingly trains Linguini but steadily appreciates him heeding her advice. Later, Remy finds Émile and reunites with the clan. After Remy tells Django that he intends to stay at the restaurant, Django shows him a group of exterminated rats to convince him that humans are dangerous, but Remy ignores his warnings and leaves. Meanwhile, Skinner discovers through a letter from Linguini's late mother that Gusteau is his father, making Linguini the rightful owner of the restaurant. Skinner is shocked and enraged about this revelation, as Gusteau's will be stated that he would inherit ownership of the restaurant only if no next of kin appeared two years after the latter's death. After his lawyer verifies that Linguini is Gusteau's son, Skinner hides the evidence in an envelope. Remy escapes with this, and shows it to Linguini, who then fires Skinner and discontinues a line of frozen food that Skinner had started. The restaurant thrives as Remy's recipes become popular, and Linguini develops a romantic relationship with Colette. Food critic Anton Ego, whose previous negative review of the restaurant broke Gusteau's heart, announces to Linguini that he will review the restaurant again the following day. After Linguini takes credit for Remy's cooking at a press conference, he and Remy have a falling out. As revenge, Remy leads his clan on a raid of the restaurant's pantries. Linguini arrives to apologize, but upon discovering the raid, he furiously expels Remy and his clan from the restaurant. The next day, Skinner captures Remy, who is quickly freed by Django and Émile. After returning to the restaurant, he and Linguini reconcile, and Linguini reveals Remy and his cooking techniques to his staff, who all immediately quit. Reminded of Gusteau's motto, Colette returns to help the clan cook under Remy's direction while Linguini waits tables. Skinner and a health inspector attempt to interfere, but the rats tie them up, gag them and lock them in the pantry. Remy shows Colette a recipe card for ratatouille, and Colette starts to prepare it the traditional way, as a stew, but Remy has different ideas. Remy then effectively re-creates confit byaldi, a variation of ratatouille with thinly sliced vegetables served on a plate, which evokes in Ego fond memories of his mother's cooking. Delighted, Ego asks to meet the chef and is stunned when introduced to Remy. The next day, he writes a review, stating that he has come to understand Gusteau's motto and describing Remy without revealing that he is a rat. Skinner and the health inspector are released, and Gusteau's is shut down, costing Ego his job and reputation. Remy, Linguini, and Colette open a bistro called La Ratatouille, which a now-happier Ego invests in and frequents. The rat colony settles into the bistro's attic as their new home.",

Shōya blames Shōko when she tries to help him, and they get into a physical altercation. The latter is subsequently transferred to another school, with Shōya keeping her notebook. With his reputation as a bully following him through middle school, Shōya becomes a depressed loner in high school who believes suicide is his only absolution. However, he makes amends with those he has wronged before ending his life. Shōya reconciles with Shōko when returning her notebook at the sign language center she attends, realizing she is still lonely due to her shyness. Shōya is also befriended by Tomohiro Nagatsuka, a similarly friendless classmate who feels indebted to Shōya for saving him from a bully. Shōya tries to meet up with Shōko to help her feed the koi in the river, much to the ire of her younger sister, Yuzuru. When Shōya illegally jumps into the river to retrieve Shōko's notebook, Yuzuru takes a photo of the incident and posts it online to have him suspended from school. Yuzuru runs away from home after an argument with Shōko over the incident. Shōya offers to let Yuzuru stay at his house, and the two begin to bond. Shōya helps Shōko reconnect with Miyoko Sahara, a kind classmate who genuinely befriended Shōko and is currently in the same school as Naoka Ueno, who also bullied Shōko and weasels back into Shōya's life. Shōko also meets Miki Kawai, her elementary school class president, who now attends the same school as Shōya and is in a relationship with Satoshi Mashiba. Shōko later gives Shōya a gift and verbally confesses her feelings for him, but runs off upset when Shōya mishears her. Shōya invites Shōko to an amusement park with Tomohiro, Miyoko, Miki, and Satoshi. They are joined by Naoka, who is infatuated with Shōya while trying to reconnect him with their old friends. Naoka also grudges Shōko for Shōya's misfortune before slapping her, which Yuzuru secretly records for Shōya to see. This leads to the group falling out the following day when Miki desperately exposes Shōya's past to the others to remain blameless in Shōko's bullying. Shōya isolates himself from everyone but the Nishimiyas. After Shōko and Yuzuru's grandmother passes away, Shōya takes them to the countryside to cheer them up, where he realizes that Shōko blames herself for everything that has happened to him. Shōya decides to devote his entire social life to the sisters. During a fireworks festival, Shōko leaves early, ostensibly to finish her homework. Shōya follows her to retrieve Yuzuru's camera, finding Shōko preparing to jump from her balcony. Shōya manages to stop her, only to fall into the river below. He is rescued by his former friends Kazuki Shimada and Keisuke Hirose, but his injuries render him comatose. One night, Shōko dreams about receiving a farewell visit from Shōya. Shōya awakens from his coma and makes his way to the bridge, where he finds Shōko weeping. He apologizes for bullying her and tells her not to blame herself for how his life has turned out. He also admits his original plan to commit suicide but has decided against it while asking Shōko to help him keep living, to which she agrees. When Shōya returns to school, he reunites with his friends and realizes how much they still care for him. As they all go to the school festival together, Shōya tears up, realizing he has finally redeemed himself.",

    "plot": "Ten-year-old Chihiro Ogino and her parents Akio and Yūko travel to their new home. Akio, taking a shortcut, stops in front of a tunnel leading to what appears to be an abandoned resort town, which Yūko insists on exploring over Chihiro's protestations. Upon finding a seemingly empty restaurant stocked with food, Chihiro's parents immediately begin to eat. While exploring further, Chihiro finds an enormous bathhouse and meets a boy named Haku, who warns her to return across the riverbed before sunset. However, spirits begin to appear, and Chihiro discovers that her parents have been transformed into pigs and that she cannot cross the now-flooded river. Haku finds Chihiro and instructs her to ask for a job from the bathhouse's boiler-man, Kamaji, a yōkai spirit commanding soot sprites known as susuwatari. Kamaji instead asks a worker named Lin to bring Chihiro to Kamaji's master Yubaba, the witch who runs the bathhouse and who cursed Chihiro's parents. Yubaba tries to frighten Chihiro away but eventually gives her a work contract. As Chihiro signs the contract with her name (千尋), Yubaba takes away the second kanji in her name, renaming her Sen (千). She soon forgets her real name, and Haku later explains that Yubaba controls people by taking their names; if Chihiro completely forgets hers like he once did, she will never be able to leave the spirit world. The other workers, except for Kamaji and Lin, frequently mock Sen. While working, she invites a silent creature named No-Face inside, believing him to be a customer. The spirit of a polluted river arrives as Sen's first customer. After she cleans him, he gives her a magic emetic dumpling as a token of gratitude. Meanwhile, No-Face demands food from the bathhouse workers, granting gold copied from the river spirit in exchange. However, when Sen declines the gold and leaves to find Haku, No-Face angrily swallows some workers. Sen sees paper shikigami spirits attacking a dragon and recognizes the dragon as a metamorphosed Haku. When the seriously injured Haku crashes into Yubaba's penthouse, Sen follows him upstairs. A shikigami that stowed away on her back shapeshifts into Yubaba's twin sister Zeniba, who turns Yubaba's son, Boh, into a mouse and creates a false copy of him. Zeniba tells Sen that Haku has stolen a magic golden seal from her that carries a deadly curse. Haku strikes the shikigami, causing Zeniba to vanish. Sen and Haku fall into the boiler room, where she feeds him part of the emetic dumpling. He vomits up the seal and a slug that a disgusted Sen kills. Sen resolves to return the seal and apologize to Zeniba. She confronts an engorged No-Face and feeds him the rest of the dumpling, forcing him to regurgitate the workers. No-Face follows Sen out of the bathhouse, and Lin helps them leave. Sen, No-Face, and Boh travel to see Zeniba using train tickets from Kamaji. Meanwhile, Yubaba nearly orders Sen's parents slaughtered, but Haku reveals Boh is missing and offers to retrieve him if Yubaba releases Sen and her parents. Yubaba agrees, but only if Sen can pass a final test. The train crosses a sea to a land where Sen meets Zeniba, who reveals that Yubaba used the slug to control Haku. Zeniba tells Sen that she can't help her parents, but she makes her a magic protective hairband. Using his dragon form, Haku flies Sen and Boh back, while No-Face decides to stay with Zeniba. Mid-flight, Sen recalls falling into the Kohaku River years earlier and being washed safely ashore, correctly guessing Haku's real identity as the spirit of the Kohaku River and restoring his memory. When they arrive at the bathhouse, Yubaba tests Sen, asking her to identify her parents among a group of pigs. After she answers correctly that none of the pigs are her parents, her contract disappears and she is given back her real name. Haku takes her to the now-dry riverbed and vows to meet her again. Chihiro crosses the riverbed to her restored parents. Shortly before leaving for her new home, Chihiro looks back at the tunnel, still wearing her hairband from Zeniba.",

    "plot": "In a world inhabited by monsters, the city of Monstropolis harnesses the screams of human children for energy. At the Monsters, Incorporated factory, skilled monsters employed as \"scarers\" venture into the human world to scare children and harvest their screams through doors that activate portals to children's bedroom closets. The work is considered dangerous, as humans are believed to be toxic and capable of killing a monster through physical contact. Monsters, Inc. CEO, Henry J. Waternoose III, is concerned about the declining energy production, as children are becoming less easily scared. One evening after work, top scarer James P. \"Sulley\" Sullivan discovers that an active door has been left in the station of his rival, Randall Boggs. He inspects the door and accidentally lets a toddler girl into the factory. Frightened, Sulley unsuccessfully tries returning the girl, who escapes into Monstropolis, interrupting Sulley's best friend and assistant Mike Wazowski on a date at a sushi restaurant. Chaos erupts when other monsters see the girl; Sulley and Mike escape with her as the Child Detection Agency (CDA) arrives and quarantines the restaurant. Forced to keep the girl hidden in their apartment for the night, Sulley realizes that the rumor of humans being toxic is actually false, and their laughter can generate more energy than screams. The next day, Sulley and Mike disguise the girl as a monster and attempt to send her home. While Mike seeks out her door, Sulley grows attached to her and nicknames her \"Boo\". Randall, waiting in ambush for the girl, kidnaps Mike by accident and reveals his plan to kidnap children and extract screams from them using his invention, the Scream Extractor. Sulley rescues Mike, and they search for Waternoose to alert him of Randall's plan. However, Boo inadvertently reveals herself to Waternoose, who reveals that he is working with Randall. Waternoose banishes Mike and Sulley to the Himalayas in the human world, and abducts Boo. Sulley finds a way to return to the monster world, but Mike refuses to go with him. Sulley returns to the factory and rescues Boo from the Scream Extractor, but Randall fights him. Mike returns to reconcile with Sulley, and both search for Boo's door. Randall eventually catches up to the trio, and Boo easily defeats him after a chase through the factory door vault. Sulley and Mike banish Randall through a door to the human world and destroy it. Mike and Sulley locate Boo's door, but Waternoose brings it down to the scare floor, intending to have the CDA arrest Mike and Sulley. Mike distracts the CDA while Sulley and Boo lure Waternoose into a scare simulation room. There, Sulley tricks Waternoose into revealing his conspiracy with Randall to kidnap thousands of children. Mike records the conversation, exposing Waternoose to the CDA, who arrest him. Undercover CDA agent Roz allows Sulley to send Boo home, but has her door destroyed. Sulley retools the company's power generation method to harvest children's laughter instead of screams, as laughter is ten times more powerful. With the energy crisis solved, the factory is now focused on making children laugh to collect energy; Mike becomes the company's top comedian and Sulley becomes the new CEO. Mike then reveals to Sulley he has rebuilt Boo's door. Sulley enters the door and reunites with Boo.",

After saving Wheezy from being sold at a yard sale, Woody is found and stolen by a greedy toy collector. Buzz fails to foil the theft, but finds clues identifying the collector as Al McWhiggin, the owner of the Al's Toy Barn store. Buzz, Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, Rex, and Hamm set out to rescue Woody. At Al's apartment, Woody discovers that he was designed after the protagonist of Woody's Roundup, a popular 1950s children's Western series, and meets his co-star character dolls: Jessie the Cowgirl, Bullseye the Horse, and Stinky Pete the Prospector. While delighted to meet them, Woody realizes that Al plans to sell the entire Woody's Roundup collection to a toy museum in Tokyo. Woody announces that he has to return home to Andy, dismaying the gang, because the museum will not accept the collection without him, and they will go back into storage. After Woody's arm is repaired the next day, Woody learns that Jessie was abandoned by her owner, Emily, when she grew up. Convinced that Andy might do the same to him, Woody decides to go to the museum. Meanwhile, Buzz's group reaches Al's Toy Barn and searches for Woody. Buzz encounters a Utility Belt Buzz toy; assuming he is a real space ranger going AWOL, Utility Belt Buzz imprisons Andy's Buzz. Utility Belt Buzz later meets Andy's other toys and, assuming they are on a mission to defeat his arch-nemesis, Emperor Zurg, accompanies them to Al's apartment. Andy's Buzz escapes and follows the gang, inadvertently releasing a toy Zurg who follows Buzz to destroy him. Both Buzzes and the rest of the search party arrive at the apartment, but Woody initially refuses to go home with them. Shortly after the search party leaves, Woody reconsiders and invites the Woody's Roundup toys to join him and become Andy's toys. While a hesitant Jessie and an enthusiastic Bullseye accept Woody's offer, Pete refuses and blocks the others from leaving; having never been played with, he is adamant about going to the museum. Al returns to the apartment and takes the Woody's Roundup collection to the airport. On the elevator ride down, Zurg appears and fights Utility Belt Buzz until he is knocked off the elevator by Rex. The two end up reconciling after Buzz learns Zurg is his father, while Andy's Buzz and the other toys pursue Al to the airport in a Pizza Planet truck while being accompanied by three toy aliens. Following a prolonged pursuit through the airport's baggage sorting system—during which Pete re-opens the tear in Woody's arm—the other toys subdue Pete and place him in the backpack of a little girl, who takes Pete with her. They save Bullseye, but Jessie is loaded onto the plane. Woody, Buzz, and Bullseye work together to save her just as the plane takes off. The toys then return home to Andy's house. Andy returns from Cowboy Camp that night, plays with Jessie and Bullseye, and repairs Woody and Wheezy the following morning. Al mourns the loss of the lucrative deal with the toy museum on television. Woody tells Buzz that he no longer fears Andy losing interest in him.",

After the birth of their daughter Ember, they set up their Blue Flame which represents their traditions and start their own convenience store called the Fireplace. Several years later, Bernie intends to retire and give Ember the store once she can control her fiery temper. One day, when Bernie allows Ember to run the shop on her own, she becomes overwhelmed by the customers and rushes to the basement. Her fiery outburst breaks a water pipe, flooding the basement and summoning Wade Ripple, a water element and city inspector, who notes the faulty plumbing. Despite Ember's attempts to stop him, Wade travels to City Hall and reluctantly files a report of his findings with his air element employer, Gale Cumulus, who will have the Fireplace shut down. Ember keeps this a secret from her parents, and does not tell them that she is the reason why the pipe burst. Wade brings Ember to Cyclone Stadium to persuade Gale to reconsider the shutdown of her father's store. Wade mentions to Ember that he was searching for a leak in the city's canals before ending up at the Fireplace, and suggests to Gale that he and Ember can track the source of the leak from the store. Gale offers to forgive the violations as long as they find and seal the leak by the end of the week. While searching the canals, Ember and Wade discover a hole in a dam that allows wave runoff from ships to flood the city's plumbing, so they close the hole with sandbags. The two spend time together in the city and learn more about each other. Meanwhile, Cinder suspects that Ember is seeing someone. The sandbags eventually fail, so Ember melts the sand into glass to form a sturdier seal. Ember visits Wade's family at a luxury apartment, where she uses her fire to fix a broken glass pitcher, impressing Wade's mother Brook, who recommends her for a glass-making internship. While playing \"the Crying Game\", Wade makes Ember cry by admitting he has feelings for her. Gale calls Wade and approves Ember's glass seal, thus saving the Fireplace from closure. Ember then realizes that she does not want to take over the store. Bernie announces to Ember and Cinder his intention to retire and hand the Fireplace to Ember. The next evening, Wade takes Ember to Garden Central Station to see Vivisteria flowers, a species that can thrive in any environment, which she was denied seeing in childhood. With the station now flooded, Gale provides Ember with an air bubble for safety while Wade pushes her underwater through the station. Afterward, Ember and Wade realize that they are able to touch without harming each other and share a dance, but Ember remembers her duty to the Fireplace and her family's prejudice against water elements, and breaks up with Wade. While Ember is about the take over the Fireplace during a party, Wade appears and declares his love for her, while also accidentally revealing that she caused the broken pipe. Ember rejects Wade, though Cinder senses genuine affection. Angry and disappointed, Bernie refuses to give Ember the store and calls off his retirement. Soon after, the new seal on the dam breaks and the Fire district floods. After saving the Blue Flame, Ember and Wade become trapped in a room in the Fireplace, causing Wade to evaporate from the enclosed heat. After the flood recedes, a grief-stricken Ember confesses to Bernie that she does not want to run the Fireplace and expresses her love for Wade. Realizing that Wade has condensed within the stone ceiling, Ember plays the Crying Game to get him to cry and drip back into his normal form. Ember and Wade embrace and share their first kiss.

    "plot": "Andy Davis, who has not played with his toys in years, is leaving for college, and intends to take Woody with him. Buzz Lightyear, Jessie, and the others are put in a bag to be stored in the attic, but Andy's mother mistakenly takes the bag to the curb for garbage pickup. The toys escape and, believing Andy intended to throw them away, join Barbie in a donation box bound for Sunnyside Daycare. Woody pursues the others and fails to convince them of the truth. Andy's toys are welcomed by the other toys at Sunnyside, and are given a tour of the seemingly perfect play-setting by Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear (\"Lotso\"), Big Baby, and Ken, with whom Barbie falls in love. All the toys choose to stay, except Woody, who attempts to return home. A Sunnyside child named Bonnie finds Woody and takes him to her house, playing with him and her other toys. After Andy's toys endure a rough playtime with the toddlers, Buzz asks Lotso to have himself and his friends moved to the older children's room, but is instead captured. Lotso is revealed to be running a police state among the daycare's toys; he tells Buzz he sends all newly arrived toys to the toddler room for his gang's safety, regardless of whether the new toys are age-appropriate or get broken. Seeing promise in Buzz, Lotso has him switched to demo mode, brainwashing him into believing Lotso is his commander. Meanwhile, Mrs. Potato Head, who lost an eye in Andy's room, sees an upset Andy searching for his toys. Andy's toys realize their mistake and attempt to leave, but are captured and imprisoned by Buzz on Lotso's order. At Bonnie's house, Woody meets a toy clown named Chuckles, and learns that Chuckles, Lotso, and Big Baby were once owned by a girl named Daisy. When the three toys were accidentally lost during a road trip, they traveled back to Daisy's house on foot, only to find that Daisy's parents had replaced Lotso. After convincing Big Baby that Daisy had replaced them, Lotso led the toys to Sunnyside, taking it over as a dictator. Woody returns to Sunnyside and reunites with his friends. That night, Andy's toys initiate an escape plan, accidentally resetting Buzz to Spanish mode in the process. \"Spanish Buzz\" immediately befriends Woody and begins a relationship with Jessie. The toys escape the building, getting as far as Sunnyside's dumpster, but Lotso and his gang thwart them. As a trash truck approaches, Woody reveals Lotso's deception to Big Baby, who promptly throws Lotso into the dumpster. Andy's toys attempt to escape, but Lotso pulls Woody in with him. Andy's other toys jump in to help, and fall into the truck, where a junked television hits Buzz and restores him to his normal persona. The toys are brought to a local trash center, and most of them are dumped on a conveyor belt leading to an incinerator. Woody and Buzz help Lotso avoid a shredder, and later to reach an emergency stop button, but once he is safe, Lotso abandons them. As Woody and his friends accept their impending fate, Andy's Aliens rescue them with an industrial claw. A trash truck driver later finds Lotso and straps him to his truck's radiator grille. Woody and his friends ride another garbage truck, driven by an adult Sid Phillips, back to Andy's house. Andy discovers a note from Woody and, assuming it is from his mother, donates the toys to Bonnie, who lives nearby. Andy introduces the toys individually to Bonnie, and is surprised to find Woody at the bottom of the donation box. After Bonnie recognizes Woody, an initially hesitant Andy passes him on to her. Andy plays with Bonnie before leaving; Woody bids him a quiet farewell, and the toys begin their new life with Bonnie. Later, Woody and the other toys learn that Barbie, Ken, and Big Baby have improved the lives of the toys at Sunnyside.",

    "plot": "Mitsuha Miyamizu is a high school student in Itomori, a rural town in the Gifu prefecture of central Japan. Having grown bored of her provincial life, she wishes to be reborn as a boy from Tokyo. Soon, she begins to intermittently switch bodies with Taki Tachibana, a high school student (and part-time waiter) from Tokyo's ward of Shinjuku. On certain days, Taki and Mitsuha wake up in each other's bodies and must live the entire day as the other, reverting when they sleep. The two set up ground rules for sharing their bodies, communicating via writing messages on paper, their phones, and their skin. Mitsuha (in Taki's body) sets Taki up on a date with his coworker, Miki Okudera, while Taki (in Mitsuha's body) helps Mitsuha become more popular at school. While in Mitsuha's body, Taki accompanies Mitsuha's grandmother Hitoha and younger sister Yotsuha to a Shinto shrine in the Goshintai crater near Itomori, leaving an offering of kuchikamizake fermented with Mitsuha's saliva. Hitoha explains that God is sovereign over both time and the connections between humans. Mitsuha informs Taki that the comet Tiamat is expected to pass nearest to Earth on the day of the autumn festival. The next day, Taki goes on a date (at the National Art Center in Roppongi) with Okudera in his own body; Okudera enjoys the date but says she can tell Taki is preoccupied with someone else, owing to his unusual behavior. Realizing he is falling for Mitsuha, Taki attempts to dial her number, but cannot reach her. The body-switching stops as inexplicably as it started. Taki, Okudera, and his classmate Tsukasa Fujii travel to Hida to search for Mitsuha. As Taki does not know the name of her village, he sketches its landscape from memory. A ramen-shop owner in Takayama recognizes the town as Itomori and offers to take the trio there. When they arrive, they find the town completely in ruins (with Mitsuha's messages simultaneously vanishing from his phone), having been almost entirely decimated by fragments that fell from Tiamat. Since the comet passed three years earlier, Taki realizes that he and Mitsuha were separated by three years, with her living in 2013 and him in 2016. At Hida City Library, the three discover that Mitsuha, her family members, and friends were among the five-hundred victims killed by the comet's impact. Taki then begins to lose his memories of Mitsuha. Frantically, Taki leaves his inn accommodation and rushes to the shrine at Goshintai to imbibe Mitsuha's kuchikamizake. Upon doing so, he faints, undergoing a vision chronicling much of her life, and realizes that she once came to Tokyo to find him. Although he was unaware of whom she was, she passed her crimson kumihimo braid to him, which he has worn as a good-luck bracelet ever since. He then awakens in Mitsuha's body on the morning of the festival. Hitoha undergoes an epiphany upon observing \"Mitsuha's\" uncharacteristic behavior; speaking directly to Taki, she reveals that the body-switching phenomenon has been in their family for centuries. Realizing he has a chance to save Mitsuha and the entire town, Taki convinces Mitsuha's friends, Sayaka and Tessie, to assist in broadcasting an emergency signal to evacuate Itomori before the meteor fragments strike. He then rushes to the shrine, where Mitsuha has just woken up in Taki's body. As twilight falls, their timelines intersect, allowing them to finally meet in person. Taki returns Mitsuha's braid, and they attempt to write their names on each other's palms, but twilight ends before Mitsuha can write hers. Returning to Itomori by foot, Mitsuha observes that the evacuation plan had failed. She then successfully convinces the mayor, her estranged father Toshiki, to order an evacuation drill. Beginning to forget Taki, she discovers that he had written \"I love you\" on her hand instead of his name. Taki awakens in his own time with no memory of Mitsuha. Five years later, Taki, who has graduated from university, struggles to find a job: he is haunted by persistent feelings of longing and emptiness. He has continuously fixated on the impact of Tiamat, from which the residents of Itomori were miraculously saved by a fortuitous evacuation drill, but is unable to determine why. Eventually, on April 8, 2022, he glimpses Mitsuha, who has moved to Tokyo, on a parallel metro train, and they race to find each other. On the steps of Suga Shrine, Taki calls out to Mitsuha, and the two simultaneously ask for each other's names, declaiming the film's title (Your Name).",

    "title": "A Christmas Carol",
    "plot": "Ebenezer Scrooge is a greedy and miserly moneylender living in Victorian London who refuses to partake in the merriment of Christmas. On Christmas Eve in 1843, he declines his cheerful nephew Fred's invitation to the annual Christmas dinner party and dismisses two gentlemen who are collecting money for charity. His loyal employee Bob Cratchit requests to not work on Christmas Day so he can spend time with his family, to which Scrooge reluctantly agrees. That night, Scrooge encounters the shackled ghost of his seven years dead business partner Jacob Marley in his home. Marley warns Scrooge to repent his ways or suffer a worse fate, stating that three spirits will visit him over three nights. At one o'clock, Scrooge is visited by the candle-like Ghost of Christmas Past, who shows him visions of his early life, such as his lonely boarding school days, his relationship with his beloved sister Fan, and his time as an apprentice under the benevolent Fezziwig. The young Scrooge met a young woman named Belle, with whom he falls in love, but his focus on accruing wealth drives them apart. Overwhelmed, Scrooge extinguishes the Ghost's flame and returns home. Scrooge next meets the merry Ghost of Christmas Present, who shows how others find joy on Christmas Day. Scrooge and the Ghost visit Bob's house, learning his family is content with their small dinner and meagre home. Scrooge takes pity on Bob's ill son Tiny Tim, whom the rapidly aging Ghost comments might not survive until next Christmas. They next visit Fred's house, where Fred insists the guests raise a toast to Scrooge in spite of his stinginess and general ill will. Before the Ghost withers away, he shows Scrooge the evils of \"Ignorance\" and \"Want\". The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come takes Scrooge into the future where a recent death elicits no sympathy from London's inhabitants. After being chased across London by the Ghost, Scrooge sees his charwoman Mrs. Dilber trade the deceased's possessions to a fence named Old Joe. Scrooge sees the deceased's body but refuses to see his face. After being shown a couple relieved of the death, Scrooge asks to see tenderness connected to death; the Ghost shows Scrooge the Cratchits' home, where he sees Bob and his family mourning the death of Tiny Tim. Clarifying for the identity of the dead man, Scrooge is taken to a cemetery, where the Ghost points out a neglected grave, bearing the name of Scrooge and that he will die on Christmas Day of an unknown (possibly imminent) year. Scrooge desperately vows to change his ways before falling into his empty coffin above the flames of Hell, only to find himself returned to his bedroom in the present. Discovering it is Christmas Day, a gleeful Scrooge begins spreading happiness and joy around London, anonymously sending the Cratchits a turkey dinner, providing charity to one of the portly gentleman, and attending Fred's Christmas dinner, where he is warmly welcomed. The next day, Scrooge raises Bob's salary and pledges his support for the Cratchits. Scrooge becomes a father figure to Tiny Tim, who overcomes his ailments and is restored to health, treating everyone with kindness, generosity, and compassion, thus embodying the Christmas spirit.",

    "title": "Finding Nemo",
    "plot": "Marlin and Coral, a clownfish couple who are waiting for their eggs to hatch, live on the edge of the Great Barrier Reef. After a barracuda knocks Marlin unconscious, Marlin awakens to find Coral and all but one of the eggs gone. Marlin names the surviving child Nemo and vows to keep him safe. Years later, Marlin and Nemo live in a secluded sea anemone. Nemo is eager to start school and explore the outside world. While dropping Nemo off at school, Marlin warns the teacher of Nemo's deformed pelvic fin. After discovering Nemo's class will be visiting the \"drop-off\", where the reef meets the open sea, Marlin panics and tries to withdraw Nemo from school. Nemo defiantly swims to a nearby speedboat and is captured by a pair of scuba divers. Marlin races after the boat and meets Dory, a blue tang with short-term memory loss who offers to help him. The pair encounter Bruce, a Great White Shark who is part of a support group of sharks trying to abstain from eating fish. At the meeting, Marlin finds a diver's mask from the boat with an address written on it. When Marlin accidentally injures Dory, Bruce smells her blood and relapses into a rampage that sets off old naval mines. As they escape, Dory recalls that she can read the address. Meanwhile, Nemo is placed in a fish tank in dentist Philip Sherman's office in Sydney. He meets the \"Tank Gang\", led by Gill, a scarred Moorish idol. They inform him that Sherman plans to gift Nemo to his niece, Darla, who has an infamous history of killing her pet fish. To prevent this, Gill hatches an escape plan: Nemo, the smallest of the gang, will clog the tank's filter, forcing Sherman to clean it and bag the fish. Then, they can roll their bags out the window and into the harbour. Nemo attempts the plan but is nearly killed by the filter's machinery in the process, causing Gill to feel deeply regretful. Dory accidentally drops the mask into an abyss and encourages Marlin to help her search for it. They find the mask but are attacked by an anglerfish. Dory exploits the anglerfish's light to read the address while Marlin traps the anglerfish with the mask. Their victory boosts Marlin's confidence and helps Dory remember the address. Marlin tries to continue his search without Dory until she convinces a school of moonfish to give them directions to the East Australian Current. On their way, Marlin and Dory become trapped in a forest of jellyfish. While trying to escape, they are both stung by jellyfish and fall unconscious. Marlin and Dory awaken in the East Australian Current with a large group of sea turtles, including Crush and his son, Squirt. Crush teaches Marlin to relax and be less worried about Nemo. News of Marlin's journey spreads across the ocean and reaches Nigel, a pelican who regularly converses with the Tank Gang. Nigel informs Nemo of Marlin's efforts; inspired, Nemo successfully clogs the filter and the tank quickly becomes covered in green algae. After leaving the current, Marlin and Dory become lost and are consumed by a blue whale. Marlin fears the worst, but Dory urges him to trust the whale, which safely expels them through its blowhole into the Sydney Harbour. Nigel rescues Marlin and Dory from a flock of seagulls and delivers them to Sherman's office, where Nemo is playing dead to fake out Darla. Sherman forces Nigel out and Gill helps Nemo escape down the sink drain and into the harbour. Believing Nemo is genuinely dead, Marlin says goodbye to Dory and leaves, but Dory soon finds Nemo and reunites them. A fishing trawler captures Dory and a school of groupers. Nemo persuades Marlin to let him swim into the net and lead the groupers down: the fish in turn break the trawler and frees Dory. Marlin praises Nemo's bravery and tells him about his own journey. Weeks later, Marlin drops Nemo off at school, and Dory arrives shortly afterward. Nemo and Marlin share a warm hug before Marlin waves goodbye to Nemo and tells him to \"go have an adventure\".",

    "title": "WALL·E",
    "plot": "In the 29th century, Earth is a garbage-strewn wasteland due to an ecocide caused by rampant consumerism, corporate greed, and environmental neglect. Humanity was evacuated to space by the megacorporation Buy n Large on giant spaceships 700 years earlier, leaving trash-compacting \"WALL-E\" robots to clean up the planet. All but one of the robots have stopped functioning; the last remaining active WALL-E has developed a personality. WALL-E remains active by salvaging parts from inactive robots, with his pet cockroach Hal as his only companion. One day, WALL-E's routine of compressing trash and collecting interesting objects is broken by the arrival of a robot called EVE, which scans the planet for sustainable life. WALL-E is smitten by the sleek, futuristic robot, and the two begin to connect, until EVE goes into standby mode when WALL-E shows her his most recent find: a living seedling. EVE is collected by a large unmanned rocket; with WALL-E clinging on, it returns to its mothership, the starliner Axiom. In the centuries since the Axiom left Earth, its passengers have degenerated into helpless obesity due to microgravity and laziness, with robots catering to their every whim. Captain B. McCrea sits back while his robotic AI autopilot helm, nicknamed AUTO, pilots the ship. McCrea is unprepared for the positive probe response, but discovers that placing the plant in the ship's Holo-Detector will trigger a hyperjump back to Earth so that humanity can begin recolonization. When McCrea inspects EVE's storage compartment, the plant is missing, and EVE blames WALL-E for its disappearance. EVE is deemed faulty and taken to diagnostics. WALL-E intervenes and inadvertently releases the other faulty bots, causing him and EVE to be designated rogue robots. EVE tries sending WALL-E home in an escape pod, but the two witness McCrea's first mate robot, GO-4, stowing the plant in a pod set to self-destruct. WALL-E enters the pod to retrieve the plant just as it launches, and he and the plant survive the pod's destruction. EVE catches up to him and they reconcile, celebrating with a dance in space around the Axiom. EVE brings the plant to McCrea, who watches her recordings of Earth, concluding that they must save it. AUTO reveals his secret no-return directive A113, which orders them to not return to Earth on account of toxicity levels making Earth unlivable. When McCrea tries overriding the directive, AUTO electrocutes WALL-E, throws him and EVE down a garbage chute, and confines McCrea to his quarters. EVE and WALL-E are nearly ejected into space with the Axiom's garbage, but a cleaning robot inadvertently jams the airlock and rescues them. As humans and robots help to secure the plant, McCrea and AUTO fight for control of the Axiom. AUTO crushes WALL-E using the Holo-Detector, but McCrea overpowers and deactivates AUTO. EVE inserts the plant into the Holo-Detector, initiating the hyperjump back to Earth. Arriving on Earth, EVE repairs WALL-E, but his memory and personality have been erased. Heartbroken, EVE gives WALL-E a \"kiss\", which releases a static electricity shock, restoring him. WALL-E and EVE reunite as the Axiom inhabitants take their first steps on Earth. During the credits, humans and robots work to restore the ravaged planet, and the plant grows into a tree, beneath which WALL-E and EVE rest.",

Though Shrek is mortified about visiting the kingdom as an ogre, and resents Fiona's parents for locking her in the tower, Fiona convinces him to attend, and they travel to the kingdom of Far Far Away with Donkey in tow and the fairy tale creatures house sitting. They meet Fiona's parents, King Harold and Queen Lillian, who are repulsed to see they are ogres. At dinner, Shrek and Harold get into a heated argument, and afterwards Fiona encounters Fairy Godmother, a celebrity potions saleswoman who offers to help Fiona but is mortified to see she is married to Shrek. Shrek worries he is losing Fiona, particularly after finding her childhood diary and reading that she was seemingly once infatuated with Prince Charming. Harold is secretly reprimanded by Fairy Godmother, who had arranged with Harold for her son—Charming—to be the one to rescue and marry Fiona; she hopes to use the marriage to rule Far Far Away through Charming. She orders Harold to get rid of Shrek or else lose his own happy ending, so Harold hires swashbuckling outlaw and mercenary Puss in Boots to assassinate Shrek. Unable to overpower Shrek, Puss reveals that he was paid by Harold and offers to help him in gratitude for having his own life spared. Shrek, Donkey, and Puss meet with Fairy Godmother at her potions factory to find something to help Shrek appeal to Fiona, but she coldly rejects his request, insisting ogres do not deserve happy endings. They retaliate by stealing a potion labeled \"Happily Ever After\" and accidentally trashing the factory. Shrek and Donkey drink the potion and soon fall asleep. Back in Far Far Away, Fiona notices Shrek is missing and tries to find him, but she too falls asleep. The next morning, Shrek and Fiona awaken to find they are now human, and Donkey is a white stallion. In order to make the change permanent, Shrek must kiss Fiona by midnight. Shrek, Donkey, and Puss return to the castle; however, Fairy Godmother, having discovered the theft, has sent Charming to pose as human Shrek and win Fiona's love. At Fairy Godmother's urging, Shrek leaves the castle, believing that the best way to make Fiona happy is to let her go. Fiona is skeptical of Charming; therefore, to ensure the two will wed, Fairy Godmother gives Harold a love potion to put into Fiona's tea. This exchange is overheard by Shrek, Donkey, and Puss, who are arrested by the royal knights after Donkey inadvertently exposes them. While the ball begins, the fairy tale creatures - having seen the arrest on the news - rescue the trio from the dungeon. They all storm the castle with the help of Mongo, a monstrous living gingerbread man created by the Muffin Man. Though Mongo is destroyed, the group manages to break into the ball. Shrek fails to prevent Charming from kissing Fiona, but instead of falling in love, Fiona knocks him out. Harold reveals that he swapped Fiona's tainted teacup with his own, refusing to go through with the plot. Enraged, the Fairy Godmother tries to strike Shrek with a spell from her magic wand. Harold jumps in front of it and is struck; the rest of the spell reflects off his breastplate and hits the Fairy Godmother, causing her to disintegrate into bubbles. Harold reverts into the Frog Prince, having used the \"Happily Ever After\" potion years earlier to gain Lillian's love. He approves of Shrek and Fiona's marriage, while Lillian assures Harold that she still loves him. As the clock strikes midnight, Fiona declines Shrek's offer to remain human, and they revert into ogres, while Donkey also returns to normal. Everyone celebrates as the ball continues. In a mid-credits scene, Dragon, who had recently married Donkey, arrives with several dragon-donkey hybrid babies.",

    "plot": "The Huns, led by the ruthless Shan Yu, invade China by breaching the Great Wall. The Emperor orders a general mobilization, with conscription notices requiring one man from each family to join the Imperial Army. Fa Mulan, an adventurous young woman, hopes to bring honor to her family. She is arranged to meet a matchmaker to demonstrate her fitness as a future wife, but is deemed a disgrace after several mishaps. Fa Zhou, Mulan's elderly father and a renowned military veteran, is conscripted. Mulan tries dissuading him from going, but he insists that he must do his duty. Fearing for his life, she cuts her hair and takes her father's sword and armor, disguising herself as a man so that she can enlist in his stead. Quickly learning of her departure, Mulan's grandmother prays to the family's ancestors for Mulan's safety. In the family's temple, the spirits of the ancestors are awakened by Mushu, a small red dragon who is a disgraced former family guardian. The Great Ancestor decides that the powerful stone dragon guardian should guide Mulan, and sends Mushu to wake him. After accidentally destroying the guardian's statue, Mushu decides to redeem himself to the ancestors by personally aiding Mulan. Reporting to the training camp, Mulan passes as a man named \"Fa Ping\", with Mushu providing encouragement and clumsy guidance throughout her deception. Under the command of Captain Li Shang, she and her fellow recruits—including three named Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po—gradually become trained soldiers. The Emperor's belligerent counsel, Chi-Fu, threatens to dissuade the Emperor from allowing Shang's men to fight. Mushu then writes a fake letter from Shang's father, General Li, ordering Shang to follow the main imperial army into the mountains. The reinforcements set out and discover that the Huns have slaughtered Li and his troops. As the soldiers march up a mountain pass, the Huns ambush them. Mulan uses a Huolongchushui cannon to trigger an avalanche and bury the Huns, but is badly injured. Shang and the soldiers discover Mulan's true sex while her wound is bandaged. Instead of executing Mulan as the law requires, Shang spares her life and expels her from the army before departing for the Imperial City to report the Huns' defeat. Mulan, however, later discovers Shan Yu and several of his warriors have survived. Mulan travels to the city to warn Shang just as the Huns seize the palace and take the Emperor hostage. In the ensuing fight, Shan Yu's men are quickly defeated and Mulan lures Shan Yu onto the roof, and ultimately pins him down with his own sword. Guided by Mulan, Mushu uses a skyrocket to propel Shan Yu into a fireworks launching tower, killing him. The Emperor and the city's assembled inhabitants praise Mulan for having saved them, and they bow to her in honor. She accepts the Emperor's crest and Shan Yu's sword as gifts but declines his offer to join the royal council. Mulan returns home and presents these gifts to her father, but he ignores them, happy to have her back. Having become enamored with Mulan, Shang also arrives and accepts her invitation to stay for dinner. Mushu is reinstated as a Fa family guardian as the ancestors celebrate.",

    "plot": "Five years after the Viking villagers of Berk and the dragons have made peace, Hiccup and his Night Fury best friend, Toothless, map out unexplored lands. Hiccup's father, Stoick the Vast, pressures him to succeed as chieftain, although Hiccup is uncertain whether he is ready. While investigating a burnt forest, Hiccup and his girlfriend Astrid are ambushed by dragon trappers led by Eret, who works for Drago Bludvist, a warlord who plots to enslave all dragons into becoming soldiers. Hiccup and Astrid escape to Berk and warn Stoick about Drago. As Stoick fortifies Berk to prepare for battle, he explains that he once met Drago at a chieftain gathering, where Drago offered them protection from dragons if they pledged to serve him; upon denying him, he had his dragons attack them, leaving Stoick as the sole survivor. Hiccup refuses to accept that war is inevitable and flies off with Toothless in search of Drago to change his mind. Instead, they encounter a mysterious dragon rider, who is revealed to be Hiccup's mother, Valka, who was presumed dead after being taken away by a dragon during a raid. Valka explains that, like her son, she could not bring herself to slay dragons; instead, she rescues them from Drago and brings them to an island nest formed out of ice by a massive, ice-breathing alpha dragon called a Bewilderbeast, which can control smaller dragons by emitting hypnotic sound waves. Stoick and his companion Gobber track Hiccup to the nest, where Stoick discovers that Valka is alive, and they finally reunite. Meanwhile, Astrid and the other riders force Eret to lead them to Drago, who captures them. Upon learning of Berk's dragons, Drago directs his armada to attack the dragon nest. He also tries to execute Eret, but Astrid's dragon, Stormfly, saves him, prompting Eret to help the others escape. A battle rages at the nest between dragon riders, Valka's dragons, and Drago's armada. Drago unveils his own Bewilderbeast to confront the alpha, killing it and becoming the new Alpha, thus controlling all dragons. Hiccup urges Drago to cease the violence, but he refuses, citing his family's deaths from dragon attacks in his childhood and his desire to conquer the world. His Bewilderbeast hypnotizes Toothless and forces him to kill Hiccup, but Stoick sacrifices himself by taking the fatal blast instead. Grieving, Hiccup drives Toothless away. The group is stranded as Drago takes control of their dragons and rides Toothless to conquer Berk. After the group holds a Viking funeral for Stoick, Hiccup feels lost without his father and his dragon, where Valka reminds him that his father believed he could unite humans and dragons. Inspired, Hiccup and his allies return to Berk on baby dragons, immune to the Bewilderbeast's influence. Back at Berk, they find that Drago has attacked the village and taken control of the dragons. Hiccup frees Toothless from the Bewilderbeast's control and confronts Drago before the Bewilderbeast encases them in ice, from which Toothless shields Hiccup. However, Toothless blasts away the ice and enters a glowing, super-powered state, making him immune to the Bewilderbeast's control. Toothless challenges the Bewilderbeast while repeatedly shooting at it, breaking its control over the other dragons to side with him. The freed dragons fire at the Bewilderbeast until Toothless fires a massive blast, breaking its left tusk. Defeated, the Bewilderbeast retreats to the sea with Drago. The Vikings and dragons celebrate their victory. Hiccup is officially made chieftain of Berk, Valka decides to stay with her son, and the dragons accept Toothless as the new alpha. Berk undergoes repairs, and Hiccup feels confident that they will defend their way of life.",

    "title": "How to Train Your Dragon",
    "plot": "The Viking village of Berk is frequently attacked by dragons that steal livestock and endanger the villagers. Hiccup, the 15-year-old son of the village chieftain, Stoick the Vast, is deemed too weak to fight, so he creates mechanical devices under apprenticeship with Gobber, the village blacksmith. Hiccup uses a bolas launcher to shoot down a Night Fury, a rare dragon, during a dragon raid, but nobody believes him. He enters the forest and finds the Night Fury but cannot bring himself to kill the dragon. Instead, he sets the creature free. The Night Fury then suddenly pins Hiccup down, but to Hiccup's surprise, the dragon spares him. Before leaving with his fleet to find and destroy the dragons' nest, Stoick enrolls Hiccup in a dragon-fighting class with fellow teenagers Fishlegs, Snotlout, twins Ruffnut and Tuffnut, and Astrid, on whom Hiccup has a crush. Facing little success in the class, Hiccup returns to the forest and finds the Night Fury in a cove, unable to fly because Hiccup's bolas tore off half of his tail fin. Hiccup gradually befriends the dragon, naming him \"Toothless\" after his retractable teeth, and designs a harness and prosthetic fin that allows Toothless to fly with Hiccup riding atop his back. Learning dragon behavior from Toothless, Hiccup manages to pass the training by subduing the dragons, earning admiration from his peers but sparking suspicion and jealousy from Astrid. Stoick's fleet returns home unsuccessful. When Hiccup learns that he must kill a dragon for his final exam, he tries to run away with Toothless, but Astrid discovers them, and Hiccup takes her on a flight to demonstrate that Toothless is friendly. During the flight, Toothless is hypnotically drawn to the dragons' nest, where a gigantic dragon named the Red Death summons relatively smaller dragons to feed it copious amounts of live food to avoid being eaten themselves. Realizing the dragons have been forced to attack Berk to survive, Astrid wishes to tell the village, but Hiccup advises against it to protect Toothless. In his final exam, Hiccup faces a captive Monstrous Nightmare and tries to subdue it to prove that dragons can be peaceful. When Stoick unintentionally enrages the dragon into attacking, Toothless arrives to protect Hiccup but is captured. Enraged, Stoick confronts Hiccup until he accidentally tells him the location of the Dragon's Nest. Betrayed, Stoick rashly disowns Hiccup for befriending a dragon and prepares the fleet using Toothless as a guide to search and destroy the nest. Astrid prompts Hiccup to realize he spared Toothless out of compassion, not weakness. Regaining his confidence, Hiccup shows his friends how to befriend the training dragons, and they set out after their tribesmen. Stoick and his Vikings locate and break open the dragons' nest, awakening the Red Death, which easily overwhelms them. Hiccup and his friends ride in on the training dragons, distracting the monster. Hiccup attempts to free Toothless; Stoick rescues and apologizes to both Hiccup and Toothless, telling Hiccup he is proud of him as his son. In a fierce midair battle, Toothless and Hiccup destroy the Red Death's wing membranes, causing it to crash fatally. Whilst escaping the resulting explosion, Hiccup gets knocked off Toothless. He is saved by Toothless, but loses his left foot in the process. Some time later, Hiccup awakes back in Berk and finds dragons frolicking in the village and Gobber having fashioned new prosthetics for him and Toothless. Hiccup is now admired by his village, including Astrid, who kisses him. Berk begins a new era of humans and dragons living in peace.",

When he scornfully declines, she reveals her true form and transforms him into a beast and his servants into household objects as punishment for his cruelty. To break the curse, the prince must learn to love someone and gain that person's love before the last petal of the rose falls on his 21st birthday; otherwise, he will remain a beast forever. Several years later, in a nearby village, Belle, the bookworm daughter of eccentric inventor Maurice, dreams of adventure while constantly rejecting advances from Gaston, an arrogant hunter. One day, Maurice travels to a local fair to present his latest invention, a wood-chopping machine, but becomes lost in the forest. Upon seeking refuge in the Beast's castle, he is eventually detained for trespassing. After Belle finds Maurice locked in the castle dungeon, she offers to take his place as a prisoner; the Beast agrees, though Maurice does not. Belle meets the castle's servants, including candelabra Lumière (who believes that Belle has come to undo the spell), mantel clock Cogsworth, teapot Mrs. Potts, and her son Chip, a teacup. When she finds the enchanted rose, the Beast angrily forces her to flee outside. Wolves ambush Belle, and the Beast rescues her, getting injured in the process. As she nurses his wounds, they develop a rapport. In the village, Maurice fails to convince the townsfolk of the Beast. Hearing Maurice's statements, Gaston bribes Monsieur D'Arque, the warden of the local insane asylum, to have Maurice declared insane and locked up, which Gaston will use to blackmail Belle into marrying him in exchange for Maurice's release. Before they can act, Maurice leaves to attempt a rescue alone. Belle discovers Maurice's predicament via a magic mirror. Out of his love for her, the Beast releases Belle to rescue him. Returning to town, Belle reveals the Beast via the mirror, shocking the townsfolk and proving her father's sanity. Realizing she has fallen for the Beast, Gaston jealously has her thrown into the cellar with Maurice and rallies the villagers to kill the Beast. Chip, who stowed away when Belle left, frees the two with Maurice's machine. As the castle's servants defeat the villagers, Gaston attacks the depressed Beast, who regains his spirit upon seeing Belle return and spares Gaston's life, but Gaston fatally stabs him before losing his footing and falling to his demise. Belle tearfully professes her love to a dying Beast as the last petal falls, which undoes the curse, reviving the Beast, restoring him and his servants to their human forms, and restoring the castle to its true appearance. The prince and Belle later host a ball for the kingdom.",

One day, the pond is visited by a flock of ducks migrating south to Jamaica, which the family finds interesting, but Mack has no such interest. Pam tells Mack that he must open his eyes to the world. That night, Mack talks with his uncle Dan, who also does not want to leave the pond, but his loneliness makes Mack re-evaluate his stance and he decides to let his family migrate, with Uncle Dan joining them at Gwen's behest. During a rainstorm, they shelter in a swamp underneath a boardwalk where they encounter elderly heron Erin, who invites them to spend the night with her and her husband Harry in their shack. Despite the herons' frightening countenance, Erin proves their good intentions by saving Dax and Gwen from a catfish. The next day, the Mallards arrive in New York City where Uncle Dan gets them in trouble with a flock of pigeons led by the pugnacious Chump. Pam defuses the situation and Chump introduces them to her friend Delroy, a scarlet macaw from Jamaica who lives caged by a human chef that kidnapped him. Mack and Pam infiltrate the restaurant where the chef works to acquire the key to Delroy's cage and free him; he guides them to Jamaica in return. While Gwen stops for a bathroom break, Mack finds an entrance to a resort inhabited by pekins. The group enjoys the resort but Dax discovers it is a duck farm, with the chef from earlier as its current client. Mack tells Dax to go back to Pam, but he instead alerts the pekins. He loses his wing feathers from being stepped on by the chef, rendering him flightless. The family, Delroy and the pekins escape the farm. The birds stop to rest at a motel where Mack scolds Dax for being reckless. Later when the sun sets, the chef finds the birds via helicopter and captures them in a net, excluding Dax and Gwen who manage to hide. Inside, the chef plans to kill Mack and Pam first as revenge. Shifting their cage using a salsa dance they learnt at the restaurant, Mack and Pam try to reach a button to open a trapdoor but the chef catches them in the act. Delroy, assisted by Uncle Dan and the pekins, pelt the chef with food until he is knocked unconscious, hitting the trapdoor button as the chef along with Mack and Pam fall out. The chef is caught in the cargo net, but Mack and Pam continue to fall while still in their cage. They are saved by Dax and Gwen; Dax repaired his wings with some of the other birds' discarded feathers. Mack and Dax reconcile. Now led by Dax, the birds arrive in Jamaica, where Delroy reunites with his family and friends while the Mallards catch up with the duck family who visited the pond earlier. The following spring, the Mallards meet a group of penguins, who they help get to the South Pole.",

    "plot": "British spy Finn McMissile infiltrates an oil rig in the Pacific Ocean owned by criminal lemon cars to rescue fellow spy Leland Turbo. He witnesses the lemons, seemingly led by German weapons designer Professor Zündapp, loading an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) generator disguised as a TV camera onto a shipping crate. After discovering Turbo's death at the hands of the lemons, Finn is exposed and he escapes by faking his death. After winning his fourth Piston Cup honoring the late Doc Hudson, Lightning McQueen returns to Radiator Springs to spend the off-season with his friends. Italian formula race car Francesco Bernoulli challenges Lightning to participate in the World Grand Prix, an international three-race event created by former oil tycoon Sir Miles Axlerod, who intends to promote his new environmentally friendly fuel, Allinol. Lightning and his best friend Mater, along with Luigi, Guido, Fillmore, and Sarge, depart for Tokyo, where the first race takes place. At a World Grand Prix promotional event, Mater makes a scene after eating wasabi he mistakes for ice cream and seemingly leaking oil on stage, embarrassing Lightning. While cleaning up, Mater interrupts a fight between American spy Rod \"Torque\" Redline, who is tasked with delivering intel to Finn, and lemons Grem and Acer. Redline plants a device on Mater, causing Finn and his associate Holley Shiftwell to believe Mater is their contact. Meanwhile, Redline is captured and killed by Zündapp, who reveals that Allinol ignites when hit with an EMP. He informs his superior, an unknown mastermind, that Redline passed on his information. Holley recruits Mater to stop Zündapp's plot, believing him to be an undercover agent. During the race, three racers are ignited by the camera. Lightning places second in the race due to miscommunication with Mater, who was evading Zündapp's henchmen with Holley's instructions. Lightning confronts him at the pits, snapping at him and declaring he doesn't want his help. A guilt-ridden Mater prepares to return to Radiator Springs, but is taken by Finn, and they escape from the lemons in his jet, Siddeley. After traveling to Paris to gather intel from Finn's old friend Tomber, they head to Porto Corsa, Italy, where the second race takes place. Mater infiltrates the lemons' meeting as the camera ignites more racers, causing a multi-car pile-up, while Lightning wins. Due to controversy over Allinol's safety, Axlerod lifts its requirement for use in the final race in London. When Lightning decides to continue using it, the lemons plan to kill him during the race. This spooks Mater into blowing his cover, causing him, Finn, and Holley to be captured and tied up inside Big Bentley, where he admits to them that he is not the spy they think he is. As the race starts, Lightning takes the lead before passing Big Bentley, but the camera inexplicably does not ignite him. The lemons tell Mater that they planted a time bomb in Lightning's pits as a backup plan, spurring him to escape. Finn and Holley escape but realize that the lemons fitted the bomb on Mater's air filter instead. As Mater is informed of this, he flees down the track and Lightning pursues him to apologize for his outburst, while Finn apprehends Zündapp. The other lemons arrive and outnumber Finn, Holley, Mater, and Lightning, but they are rescued by the other Radiator Springs residents and Sarge's colleagues in the British Army. Mater and Lightning go to Buckingham Palace, where Mater exposes Axlerod as the mastermind, proven when he is forced to disable the bomb. It is revealed that the World Grand Prix was Axlerod's cover-up to turn the world against alternative fuels and profit from his ownership of the world's untouched oil reserves. Axlerod and the lemons are arrested, Mater receives an honorary knighthood from the Queen, and he and Lightning reconcile. Back in Radiator Springs, as Mater tells everyone about his experience, Filmore and Sarge reveal that they had swapped the Allinol with Filmore's own organic biofuel prior to the London race, explaining the camera's ineffectiveness on Lightning. The \"Radiator Springs Grand Prix\" is held, featuring the World Grand Prix contenders. Finn and Holley invite Mater to go on another mission, but he declines, Holley promises Mater she'll be back for their first date. While his weapons are confiscated, Mater keeps the rockets and speeds off with Lightning as Siddeley flies into the distance.",

The house is inhabited by small, dark, dust-like house spirits called susuwatari that can be seen when moving from bright places to dark ones. The susuwatari leave to find another empty house. Mei discovers two small spirits that lead her into the hollow of a large camphor tree. She befriends a larger spirit, which identifies itself using a series of roars that she interprets as \"Totoro\". Mei thinks Totoro is the troll from her illustrated book Three Billy Goats Gruff. She falls asleep atop Totoro but when Satsuki finds her, she is on the ground. Despite many attempts, Mei cannot show her family Totoro's tree. Tatsuo comforts her, saying Totoro will reveal himself when he wants to. The girls wait for Tatsuo's bus, which is late. Mei falls asleep on Satsuki's back and Totoro appears beside them, allowing Satsuki to see him for the first time. Totoro has only a leaf on his head for protection against the rain, prompting Satsuki to offer her umbrella to him. Delighted, he gives her a bundle of nuts and seeds in return. A giant, bus-shaped cat arrives; Totoro boards it and leaves. A few days after planting the seeds, the girls awaken at midnight to find Totoro and his fellow spirits engaged in a ceremonial dance around the planted seeds. They join in, causing the seeds to grow into an enormous tree. Totoro takes the girls for a ride on a magical flying top. In the morning, the tree is gone but the seeds have sprouted. The girls discover that a planned visit by their mother has been postponed because of a setback in her treatment. Mei is upset and argues with Satsuki. She leaves for the hospital to take fresh corn to their mother, but gets lost on the way. Mei's disappearance prompts Satsuki and the neighbors to search for her, thinking that Mei has died. In desperation, Satsuki pleads for Totoro's help. Totoro summons the Catbus, which carries Satsuki to Mei's location, and the sisters reunite. The bus then takes them to the hospital, where the girls learn that their mother has been kept in the hospital by a minor cold but is otherwise recovering well. The girls secretly leave the ear of corn on the windowsill, where their parents discover it.

While at the bank, Gru meets Perkins' son, Vector, who was responsible for the Pyramid heist. Gru and two of his Minions obtain the shrink ray from a research base in Southeast Asia, only for Vector to ambush them and steal it for himself.

On the day before his 18th birthday, Kuzco announces his plan to demolish a nearby village and have a lavish summer home constructed in its place, despite the objections of its leader Pacha. Kuzco also discovers his elderly advisor and alchemist Yzma is usurping his duties and summarily fires her. Yzma and her bumbling sidekick Kronk plot to poison Kuzco's wine and take over the empire before the news of Yzma's termination becomes public. However, Kronk takes the wrong chemical vial from Yzma's laboratory, accidentally turning Kuzco into a llama. Yzma orders Kronk to knock Kuzco out, take him outside the city, and kill him. An attack of conscience and a series of mishaps causes Kronk to drop the sack containing the unconscious Kuzco; the sack lands on the back of Pacha's cart, and Pacha leaves the city before Kronk can catch up to him. Kuzco awakens in Pacha's backyard, having lost some of his memory. Believing Pacha transformed and kidnapped him, Kuzco orders Pacha to take him home. Pacha refuses to help unless Kuzco changes his mind and builds his summer home elsewhere. Kuzco arrogantly rejects Pacha's demand and ventures into the jungle alone, despite Pacha's warnings. Kuzco is pursued by jaguars, but Pacha saves him. Kuzco begrudgingly agrees to relocate the construction site of his summer home if Pacha takes him home. On the way to the palace, Kuzco tries to renege on his promise; he and Pacha fight on a collapsing bridge, before being forced to work together to escape some crocodiles and a crumbling cliff face. Meanwhile, Yzma discovers Kronk lost Kuzco and the duo set out to find him. At a roadside diner, Pacha and Kuzco arrive at the same time as Yzma and Kronk, but neither party initially notices the other. However, Kronk nearly recognizes Pacha, who overhears Yzma's plans to murder Kuzco. He sneaks Kuzco out of the diner, but Kuzco does not believe Pacha's warnings. Kuzco and Pacha fight again and part ways. Kuzco almost approaches Yzma and Kronk, but overhears them discussing their plans to kill him; they also remark that Kuzco's subjects were not grieved by his apparent death. His self-delusions shattered by Yzma's true colors, Kuzco flees into the jungle to apologize to Pacha, but cannot find him. The next morning, Kuzco glumly resigns himself to living like a llama, but finds Pacha, and the duo reconcile. Meanwhile, Kronk remembers where he saw Pacha before and tells Yzma. Kuzco and Pacha return to Pacha's village, only to discover that Yzma and Kronk are in Pacha's house, posing as distant relatives. Pacha's family distracts Yzma to give Pacha and Kuzco a head start; however, Yzma and Kronk still manage to confront the duo in Yzma's lab. Against Yzma's orders of dispatching the duo, Kronk has another attack of conscience and Yzma repeatedly insults him and he tries to kill her instead. Yzma drops Kronk through a trapdoor. As Pacha and Kuzco flee from Yzma and her guards, Kuzco tries several different potions, without success. After figuring out which vial is the \"human\" potion, Kuzco, Pacha and Yzma fight over it; Yzma is turned into a cat by one of the other potions, and Pacha nearly falls off the side of the palace; this forces Kuzco to rescue Pacha, allowing Yzma to take the vial. With some teamwork and inadvertent assistance from Kronk, the duo defeat Yzma and recover the vial. After becoming human again, Kuzco makes amends with the people he hurt and builds a much smaller summer home on the uninhabited hill next to Pacha's. Meanwhile, Kronk goes on to become the leader of a scout troop, with Yzma, still as a cat, being a reluctant member of it.",

Experiment 626 is escorted by Captain Gantu for exile, but 626 escapes and hijacks a space cruiser that crash-lands on Kauaʻi, Hawaii, on the planet Earth. Shortly after landing on Earth, 626 is run over by three passing trucks and taken to an animal shelter. The Federation's Grand Councilwoman offers Jumba an early release if he retrieves 626 with the assistance of the council's Earth expert, Agent Pleakley. On Kauaʻi, orphaned teenager Nani Pelekai struggles to take care of her lonely, rambunctious younger sister, Lilo, following their parents' death in a car crash. Social worker Cobra Bubbles doubts Nani can be an adequate guardian for Lilo, and threatens to place Lilo in foster care if the Pelekais' situation fails to improve within three days. After overhearing Lilo wishing for a friend, Nani brings her to the animal shelter to adopt a dog. Lilo adopts 626, who is impersonating a dog, and names him \"Stitch\". Jumba and Pleakley disguise themselves as tourists while trying to capture Stitch. When Stitch attacks Pleakley at the lūʻau where Nani works, Nani is blamed for the incident and fired. Bubbles orders Nani to find a new job and tells Lilo to teach Stitch to be a \"model citizen\". Despite Lilo's attempts to domesticate Stitch, his antics repeatedly ruin Nani's efforts to find a new job. While Nani, Lilo, and Stitch go surfing with Nani's friend and former co-worker David, Jumba and Pleakley again attempt to capture Stitch, who unintentionally drags Lilo under water. David rescues Lilo and Stitch, but Bubbles, having observed the mishap, tells Nani he will retrieve Lilo the following morning. Feeling guilty for causing so much trouble, Stitch runs away. Having failed to capture Stitch, the Grand Councilwoman fires Jumba and Pleakley, and tasks Gantu with capturing Stitch. Now free, Jumba begins hunting Stitch using less-covert methods. When David informs Nani of another job opportunity, Nani leaves Lilo at home alone. Jumba and Pleakley chase Stitch back to the Pelekais' house, and the ensuing fight causes an explosion that destroys the house. Nani gets the job, but frantically returns home after seeing a fire engine driving toward her house. Bubbles arrives to retrieve Lilo. While Bubbles and Nani argue about Lilo's well-being, Lilo runs away into the woods and encounters Stitch, who reveals his alien identity, just moments before Gantu captures them both. Stitch manages to escape just as Gantu's ship takes off. Nani confronts Stitch, but Jumba and Pleakley immediately capture him. Nani asks them to save Lilo, but they insist they only have legal authority to capture Stitch. As Nani breaks down, Stitch remembers ʻohana, a term for \"family\" he learned from Lilo, and convinces Jumba to help rescue her. Jumba, Pleakley, Stitch, and Nani board Jumba's spaceship, pursue Gantu, and rescue Lilo. The Grand Councilwoman arrives to retrieve Stitch herself, and fires Gantu for endangering Lilo and failing to capture Stitch. After observing Stitch's civilized behavior and being informed that Lilo legally owns Stitch because she bought him at the animal shelter, the Grand Councilwoman decrees that Stitch will live out his exile on Earth and that the Pelekai family is under the protection of the United Galactic Federation. Bubbles reveals he is a former CIA agent who had previously met the Grand Councilwoman in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1973. Stitch, Jumba, and Pleakley, having joined Lilo and Nani's family, rebuild their house with David and Bubbles' help.",

However, Carl resolves to keep his promise to Ellie to move their house to Paradise Falls and attaches thousands of balloons to it in order to fly there. Russell, a young \"Wilderness Explorer\" scout attempting to earn his final merit badge for assisting the elderly, becomes an accidental stowaway. Before Carl can land and send Russell home, a storm propels the house all the way to South America. The house lands on a tepui opposite Paradise Falls. Carl and Russell harness themselves to the still-buoyant house and tow it across the mesa. Along the way, they encounter a giant flightless bird that Russell names Kevin (despite the fact that it is actually female) and Dug, a Golden Retriever whose collar has a device that translates his thoughts into human speech. After failed attempts to evade the animals, Carl reluctantly allows both to join the party. A pack of dogs, all wearing collar translators, surrounds them. The dogs' master is revealed to be an elderly Charles Muntz, who invites Carl and Russell aboard his airship and discusses his quest to capture a bird. However, Carl's initial excitement over meeting him fades as he realizes that Muntz's obsession has driven him insane. After Muntz shows them the bird skeleton, Russell notes its resemblance to Kevin. Becoming hostile, Muntz reveals that he has murdered other travelers he suspected of also seeking the bird. Carl, Russell and Dug flee, pursued by Muntz's dogs; they are rescued by Kevin, who gets injured in the process. Hearing Kevin call out to her chicks, Carl agrees to take her home. However, Muntz captures her and starts a fire beneath Carl's home. Forced to choose, Carl saves his home, allowing Muntz to take Kevin away and losing Russell's respect. Disheartened, Carl looks through his wife's scrapbook and discovers that she had filled in blank pages with photos of their life together and written \"Thanks for the adventure – now go have a new one!\". Reinvigorated, he goes outside, only to see Russell flying after Kevin using balloons and a leaf blower. Carl lightens his house by emptying it completely, enabling it to fly again. Russell arrives at Muntz's airship but is caught. Carl and Dug, the latter of whom stowed away, board the dirigible and free him and Kevin. Muntz pursues them and traps Russell, Kevin, and Dug inside the house, but Carl saves them just as the tether breaks. Muntz leaps after them, but gets his leg tangled in balloon strings and falls to his death. Carl's house, having lost several balloons, descends out of sight beneath the clouds. Carl and Russell reunite Kevin with her chicks before returning home to the United States in Muntz's airship. Russell receives his badge for assisting the elderly, and Carl presents Russell with a bottle cap Ellie gave Carl when they first met as kids years ago, which he dubs \"The Ellie Badge\". Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Carl, his house has landed on the cliff overlooking Paradise Falls, fulfilling his promise to Ellie.",

    "title": "Shrek Forever After",
    "plot": "In a flashback, King Harold and Queen Lillian have lost hope of their daughter, Princess Fiona, being freed from her curse after so many years of her being at the Dragon's Keep. Despite their deal with Fairy Godmother, they go to Rumpelstiltskin for help. He has a magical contract that will seemingly lift the curse if they give him the Kingdom of Far Far Away, but when Harold is about to sign it, a messenger reveals that Fiona has been rescued by Shrek. Ever since, Rumpel has held a grudge against Shrek for ruining his plan. In the present, Shrek has grown tired of being a family man and a celebrity, longing for the days when he was feared and had privacy. While he is celebrating his children's first birthday in Far Far Away, a series of mishaps leaves Shrek so angry that he storms out in a rage and lashes out at Fiona. Having witnessed the outburst, Rumpel follows Shrek into the forest and stages a scene of being in distress, prompting Shrek to help. Invited inside Rumpel's carriage, Shrek laments that he is no longer a \"real ogre\". Rumpel offers him a deal to receive a day as a \"real ogre\" in exchange for a day from his childhood being erased. Shrek signs a contract fulfilling this wish, and is whisked away into an alternate reality. Now feared by villagers, Shrek causes some mischief until he discovers that Fiona is a fugitive and his swamp is deserted and desolate. Captured by witches, Shrek is taken to Rumpel, who is now the king of a dystopian Far Far Away. Rumpel reveals to Shrek that he had erased the day Shrek was born, meaning Shrek never existed in this altered timeline. Consequently, Harold and Lillian signed the contract with Rumpel, which caused them to disappear. When the day ends, Shrek will cease to exist. Shrek escapes Rumpel's castle with Donkey, who is initially terrified of Shrek but befriends him after seeing him cry over his erased history. Donkey helps Shrek find a hidden exit clause; the contract can be nullified by \"true love's kiss\". The pair soon encounter a still-cursed Fiona leading an army of ogres in a resistance against Rumpel, and a lazy and overweight Puss in Boots being kept as Fiona's pet. Shrek unsuccessfully tries to woo Fiona, who has since lost hope of finding true love after not being rescued, and is too busy preparing an ambush on Rumpel. Puss encourages Shrek to continue pursuing Fiona. During the ambush, most of the ogres are captured by the Pied Piper, who was hired by Rumpel, but Shrek and Fiona escape with Puss and Donkey. Shrek insists that Fiona kiss him, assuring her that it will fix everything; she reluctantly obliges, but nothing happens. Later on, Rumpel publicly offers a wish to anyone who brings him Shrek, and after hearing this, Shrek turns himself in. Rumpel is forced to grant Shrek's wish, and he uses it to free the other ogres. As Shrek is locked up, Rumpel reveals that Fiona had been captured and not released, since she is not \"all ogre\". Rumpel attempts to execute Shrek and Fiona with the enslaved Dragon, but Donkey, Puss, and the freed ogres storm the castle; they capture Rumpel and defeat his witch army, while Shrek and Fiona neutralize Dragon. As the sun rises, Shrek begins to fade from existence, but Fiona, having fallen in love with him, kisses him before he disappears. Seeing that she is still an ogre in the sunlight, Fiona realizes that her curse was broken and that she has assumed \"love's true form\". The alternate reality disintegrates, making everyone disappear, and Shrek finds himself transported back to the original timeline at the moment before he lost his temper at the party. Instead of lashing out, Shrek embraces his family and friends with a newfound appreciation for them. Later, Shrek hosts a party in his swamp with his friends, family, and the other ogres, with an imprisoned Rumpel in attendance.",

    "plot": "Nine years ago, Woody and Bo Peep rescue Andy's remote control car, RC, from being washed away in a storm, before Bo and her lamp are donated to a new owner. Woody attempts to rescue her, but she insists it is okay as it is \"time for the next kid\". She asks Woody to come with her but when he hears Andy calling out for him, he chooses to stay. In the present day, after a college-bound Andy has donated his toys to Bonnie, Woody struggles to adapt as Bonnie shows little interest in playing with him and her toys already have a leader. Bonnie is quite nervous about starting kindergarten, so Woody sneaks into her backpack as moral support. When she creates a spork at her kindergarten orientation, it comes to life as Forky. Forky suffers an existential crisis, seeing himself as trash, not a toy. As Forky quickly becomes Bonnie's favorite toy, Woody tries to stop Forky from throwing himself away. When Bonnie's family goes on a road trip, Forky jumps out of the window of the RV, and Woody goes after him. As they walk to the park, Woody convinces Forky that his place is with Bonnie, and Forky overcomes his existential crisis. As they pass an antique store, he recognizes Bo Peep's lamp in the window, and detours inside to find her. They encounter a talking doll named Gabby Gabby and her ventriloquist dummy friends, who try to take Woody's voicebox to replace Gabby's broken one. Woody escapes, though Forky becomes Gabby's prisoner. At a playground nearby, Woody reunites with Bo and her sheep, who have become \"lost toys\", free from owners and able to do as they please, along with their new friend Giggle McDimples. They agree to help Woody rescue Forky. Buzz Lightyear, trying to find Woody, gets lost in a traveling carnival and encounters prize toys Bunny and Ducky. They find Woody and Bo, who take them to stunt bike toy Duke Caboom. They attempt to rescue Forky, only to nearly get killed by the store owner's cat. The toys refuse to go back due to the danger, but Woody, who doesn't believe in leaving toys behind, inadvertently insults Bo's lost toy nature, leaving her and Buzz to rescue Forky. When he confronts Gabby, she explains that she means no harm only wanting his voice box so she can be played with by the store owner's granddaughter, Harmony. Woody agrees, only for Harmony to reject Gabby afterwards. Woody sends Forky to the RV and convinces Gabby to return to Bonnie's house with him. Bo, Caboom, and the rest of the gang return and help the pair escape, and Bo and Woody reconcile. Jessie rallies Bonnie's toys to use the RV to drive back to the fair. On the way, Gabby notices a lost child at the carnival and leaves the group to comfort her until the parents arrive; the girl takes Gabby with her. Woody is hesitant to leave Bo again; Buzz assures him that Bonnie will be okay without him. Woody shares an emotional goodbye with his friends and joins Bo as a \"lost toy\". Some time later, Bonnie creates a companion for Forky from a plastic knife, while the \"lost toys\" travel with the carnival and help prize toys find owners.",

On Marty's tenth birthday, Alex, Melman and Gloria attempt to cheer him up, but he remains unsatisfied. Having learned earlier that the zoo's penguins, Skipper, Kowalski, Rico and Private, are trying to escape to Antarctica, Marty decides to follow them out of the zoo to fulfill his wish to be in the wild. Marty heads towards the Grand Central Terminal, to catch a train to nearby Connecticut. Alex, Melman and Gloria discover Marty's absence and pursue him, joined by the penguins, and chimpanzee duo Mason and Phil at Grand Central, where an army of officers subdue them. Under pressure from animal rights activists, the zoo is forced to ship the escaped animals by sea to a nature reserve in Kenya. During the trip, the penguins manage to escape their crate and hijack the ship, setting course to Antarctica, inadvertently causing the crates containing Alex and his friends to fall overboard. Upon being washed ashore on the African island of Madagascar, the quartet come across its lemur inhabitants, led by a ring-tailed lemur named King Julien XIII. The predatory fossa attack the lemurs, but are scared off by Alex's fearsome appearance. Feeling homesick, Alex blames Marty for the group's predicament, and makes several attempts to be rescued, with no success. Marty finds life in Madagascar to be exactly what he wanted, with Gloria and Melman soon joining him. Without the raw steaks Alex was provided at the Central Park Zoo, his hunger sets in triggering his predatory instincts. The next morning, King Julien and the lemurs attempt to befriend the castaways in hopes that Alex's presence will keep the fossa at bay, despite protest about Alex's predatory nature from his adviser, Maurice the aye-aye. While entertaining the lemurs, Alex starts to hallucinate everyone as steaks, briefly loses his sanity and attempts to eat them, scaring them all. Alex flees to the fossa territory of the island to protect his friends from himself. Seeing what Alex has become, and how dangerous the wild can be, Marty regrets his decision of leaving the zoo. Having found Antarctica to be inhospitable, the penguins decide to land the ship at Madagascar. Seeing the chance to finally return home, Marty tracks Alex's trail towards the fossa's territory where he tries to convince his friend of the ship's arrival, but Alex refuses, still not wanting to hurt anyone. When Marty is suddenly ambushed by the fossa, Gloria, Melman, and the penguins come to the rescue, but they are far outnumbered. Alex, having overcome his predatory instincts, arrives and rescues his friends, scaring the fossa away from the lemur territory permanently. The penguins satisfy Alex's hunger by feeding him sushi, which he finds better than steak. As the lemurs throw a farewell celebration for the group, the penguins decide not to tell them that the ship has run out of fuel, leaving them stranded on the island for the time being.",

    "plot": "Buster Moon is thriving with his newly rebuilt theater; Johnny, Rosita, Gunter, Meena, and Miss Crawly work as his cast and crew, while Ash performs as a soloist at a rock club. Buster's show fails to impress Crystal Entertainment's talent scout dog Suki Lane, who tells Buster he would not make it in Redshore City. Encouraged by Nana Noodleman, Buster rounds up his crew and they travel to the city to make an impression. They are denied entry into Crystal Entertainment but sneak in for an audition with entertainment mogul wolf Jimmy Crystal. As Jimmy is uninterested in Buster's original show pitch, Gunter suggests a space-themed sci-fi musical that features songs from Clay Calloway, a legendary rock star lion who disappeared after his wife Ruby died 15 years prior. Intrigued, and assuming that Clay will be a part of the show, Jimmy greenlights it and lets Buster and his friends stay at his hotel during production. Miss Crawly finds where Clay lives and goes to visit him, but he scares her away with a paintball gun. During rehearsal, Rosita reveals to have a fear of heights after discovering she needs to make a high jump, prompting Jimmy to insist Buster have his daughter Porsha play her part instead. Buster reluctantly writes Rosita a minor role. Top choreographer monkey Klaus Kickenklober is hired to teach Johnny to dance, but is unnecessarily harsh, causing Johnny to struggle and fall behind. Johnny later comes across a street dancer lynx named Nooshy, who takes over as his teacher. Meena is cast in a romantic scene with Darius, an egocentric actor yak, but is unable to act the part convincingly, having never been in love before. She later meets and falls in love with an ice cream vendor elephant named Alfonso. Jimmy eventually finds out that Buster never contacted Clay about the show and threatens to hurt Buster if he does not deliver. Ash and Buster visit Clay to convince him to be in the show. He refuses at first, finding it too emotionally painful to perform after his wife's death, but Ash changes his mind. Back at the theater, Buster offers Porsha to switch roles with Rosita, as Porsha's acting skills are poor. Porsha misunderstands this as Buster firing her and leaves the set. After news of the \"firing\" is broadcast on television, an outraged Jimmy nearly drops Buster off the roof of the hotel, before locking him in his closet. Suki frees Buster and warns him to get out of Redshore City before Jimmy can kill him. Clay arrives with Ash at the hotel room with the crew, and advises Buster not to run and hide as he did. After overhearing Jimmy insulting him and his crew on television, Buster decides to put on the show that night behind Jimmy's back. Porsha rejoins the show, Johnny summons his father's gang who are now released from prison on community service to keep Jimmy and his bodyguards at bay, and Rosita arranges for her husband Norman and their children to distract hotel security. During the show, a jealous Klaus takes the place of Johnny's performance partner to undermine his number, but Johnny defeats Klaus with encouragement from Nooshy and the other dancers, finally earning Klaus' respect. Porsha performs a high-energy song and dance number in the minor role originally given to Rosita, standing up to her enraged father. Meena visualizes Darius as Alfonso and successfully performs a romantic duet with him. Making a final attempt to stop the show, Jimmy drops Buster from a catwalk, which forces Rosita to overcome her phobia and make the jump to rescue Buster. When the time comes for Clay to take the stage, he claims he is not ready yet. Ash leads the crowd in a rendition of one of Clay's songs, giving him the courage to perform. After the curtain call, Jimmy tries to take credit for the show; however, Suki has him arrested. Sometime later, Buster and the crew set out to return to Calatonia, with Nooshy, Porsha, and Clay joining them. Suki stops them, and tells them that the Majestic, a major theater, wants to put on the show.",

    "plot": "Supervillain Megamind and his archnemesis, the superhero Metro Man, are aliens of different species who were both independently sent to Earth as infants before a black hole destroyed their planets. Though both land in Metro City simultaneously, Metro Man is raised in a mansion and Megamind in a prison. At the school they attend, Metro Man is well-liked by his classmates, while Megamind is relentlessly bullied until he reaches his breaking point, setting off a rivalry between him and Metro Man. Over the years, Megamind and his fish-like assistant and best friend Minion frequently and unsuccessfully battle Metro Man for control of the city. On the day of the new Metro Man Museum’s grand opening, Megamind escapes prison, kidnaps news reporter Roxanne Ritchi, and lures Metro Man to an abandoned observatory to rescue her. Megamind blasts him with a sun-powered death ray; Metro Man is unable to escape, stating the copper-lined observatory roof weakens his powers. Overjoyed, Megamind takes over the city and executes a crime spree, but eventually becomes depressed and purposeless without Metro Man to oppose him. Megamind decides to blow up the Metro Man Museum to forget the hero, but sees Roxanne is also there; as he runs, he dehydrates the museum's curator, Bernard, turning him into a small cube. Disguised as Bernard using hologram technology, Megamind talks to Roxanne, whose remarks inspire him to use Metro Man's DNA to create a new superhero to fight. Megamind perfects the formula, but during a fight between him and Roxanne in his lair, he accidentally injects it into Hal Stewart, Roxanne's cameraman who is infatuated with her. Disguising himself via hologram as Hal's \"Space Dad\", Megamind trains Hal to become a superhero. Hal, seeing this as a chance to win Roxanne's heart, accepts and takes on the name \"Titan\", which he misspells as \"Tighten\". Megamind begins to date Roxanne while disguised as Bernard, and he and Minion have a falling out over Megamind's apparent lack of interest in committing further crimes. Roxanne rejects Tighten when he comes to court her, and Tighten later witnesses her on a date with Megamind disguised as Bernard. After a heartbroken Tighten leaves, Megamind’s disguise fails, and Roxanne rejects him as well. Megamind arranges to fight Tighten the next day, but soon learns that Tighten is now using his powers to conduct a crime spree. Tighten offers to ally with Megamind, who deliberately reveals his disguises and deceptions to goad Tighten into fighting. Angered, Tighten savagely beats Megamind in the fight. Realizing that Tighten is uninterested in justice and means to kill him, Megamind traps Tighten in a copper ball, but it fails when Tighten easily breaks out. Megamind and Roxanne escape to Metro Man's old hideout and discover that he is still alive, having faked his weakness and death to rename himself Music Man, and pursue his dream as a musician. Megamind attempts to enlist his help against Tighten, but Music Man refuses; he instead attempts to encourage Megamind to become the city's new hero by telling him that a hero will always rise to defeat evil. Dejected, Megamind willingly returns to prison. Tighten goes on a rampage and kidnaps Roxanne when she tries to reason with him. On a televised message, Tighten holds Roxanne hostage and demands that Megamind fight him. Regretting his actions of trying to kill Metro Man in the first place, a redeemed Megamind escapes prison with the help of Minion and reconciles with him. He goes to confront Tighten, using holographic disguises to appear as Metro Man, and Minion as Megamind, to frighten Tighten away and rescue Roxanne. However, Megamind's speech patterns give him away, and Tighten attacks Megamind, throwing him into the stratosphere. Dehydrating himself into a cube and landing safely in a fountain, Megamind re-hydrates next to Tighten and extracts the DNA from him, removing Tighten's powers. After Hal is arrested, Megamind rekindles his relationship with Roxanne, while the city celebrates Megamind as their new hero. The museum is rebuilt in Megamind's honor, a disguised Music Man cheers for him at the grand opening ceremony, and everyone dances to Michael Jackson's \"Bad\".",

    "plot": "A year after becoming chieftain, Hiccup, his Night Fury Toothless, and their fellow dragon-riders continue to rescue captured dragons to bring them to Berk. However, the island has become overpopulated with dragons and faces constant attacks by dragon hunters. In response, Hiccup desires to find the \"Hidden World\", a safe haven for dragons once spoken of by his late father, Stoick. Meanwhile, a white female Light Fury, held captive by warlords, is given to an infamous dragon hunter named Grimmel the Grisly as bait for him to capture Toothless for the warlords' use as an alpha. Toothless finds the Light Fury in the woods, and they become enchanted until she flees, sensing Hiccup and Astrid nearby. Later, Hiccup and Tuffnut discover Grimmel's dragon traps. That night, Grimmel visits Hiccup, demanding Toothless while boasting of killing nearly every Night Fury to extinction. Hiccup, having prepared an ambush, faces Grimmel, who escapes as his Deathgripper dragons destroy Hiccup's house and Berk. Hiccup then leads the citizens and dragons to seek the Hidden World for safety from hunters. Mid-journey, the Berkians discover an island on which they initially plan to rest, but soon begin to settle there, dubbing it \"New Berk\". Seeing Toothless' inability to fly solo hindering his growing relationship with the Light Fury, Hiccup rebuilds an automatic tailfin for him. Upon receiving it, Toothless flies off, meeting up with the Light Fury and flying with her to an unknown land. On a scouting patrol, Valka notices Grimmel's approaching army and reports back to Hiccup. Hiccup and the dragon riders head to capture Grimmel, but fall into his trap and barely escape, except Ruffnut, who irritates Grimmel until he lets her go. Hiccup, Astrid, and Stormfly search for Toothless and find the Hidden World, where Toothless has become the alpha of the dragons there with the Light Fury as his mate. When the resident dragons spot Hiccup and Astrid, they attack the duo, but Toothless saves them and returns to New Berk. Hiccup realizes that humans would be intruders and are unsafe in the Hidden World. Ruffnut returns but unknowingly leads Grimmel right to them. He captures Toothless and the Light Fury, who had followed Toothless back to the island. Grimmel uses Toothless's alpha status to capture Berk's dragons by threatening to kill the Light Fury if he does not comply. With Astrid's support, Hiccup joins the dragon riders to thwart Grimmel and his army. They surprise Grimmel's forces while gliding on wingsuits, sparking a battle to rescue the dragons. Hiccup, aided by Stormfly, frees Toothless as Grimmel drugs the Light Fury and flies off with her. Hiccup and Toothless chase Grimmel, defeating his Deathgrippers with lightning, but Grimmel tranquilizes Toothless midair, making him fall. Realizing he needs help, Hiccup frees the Light Fury and urges her to save Toothless before falling with Grimmel towards the ocean. The Light Fury saves Toothless and returns to rescue Hiccup, who removes his prosthetic leg that Grimmel was holding onto before being carried away, leaving him to die from the impact. Back on the island, Toothless and Hiccup acknowledge that dragons are not safe in the human world and that humans are forbidden in the Hidden World. Hiccup shares a heartfelt goodbye with Toothless as the Berkians release their dragons to the Hidden World. Months later, Hiccup and Astrid marry and become New Berk's chieftains. Nine years later, Toothless and the Light Fury have mated and hatched three hybrid dragon fledglings called Night Lights. Hiccup, Astrid, and their two children sail across the sea to visit them at the edge of the Hidden World. After introducing his son and daughter to his old friend, Hiccup and Astrid take their children flying on Toothless and Stormfly, accompanied by the Light Fury and their offspring. Hiccup vows that, until humans and dragons are ready to co-exist peacefully, the dragons will stay hidden while the Berkians guard their secret.",

    "plot": "In 2002 Toronto, 13-year-old Meilin \"Mei\" Lee lives with her parents, Ming and Jin, helps take care of the family's temple dedicated to her maternal ancestor Sun Yee, and works to make her mother proud. She hides her personal interests from Ming, such as the fact that she and her friends Miriam, Priya, and Abby are fans of the boy band 4*Town. One night when Ming, who is strict and overprotective, discovers Mei's crush on Devon, the 17-year-old local convenience store clerk, she inadvertently humiliates Mei in public. That night, Mei has a vivid nightmare involving red pandas. When she wakes up the next morning, she finds that she has transformed into a large red panda. She hides from her parents and discovers that she transforms only when she is in a state of high emotion. When Mei reverts to human form, her hair remains red, and so she goes to school in a touque. Ming initially believes Mei is experiencing her first period, but learns the truth when she gets into an altercation with the school's security guard, causing Mei to transform from embarrassment and run home in panic and tears. Ming and Jin explain that Sun Yee was granted this transformation to protect her daughters and her village during wartime, and that all her female descendants have also had this ability. This has become inconvenient and dangerous in modern times, so the red panda spirit must be sealed in a talisman by a ritual on the night of a lunar eclipse, which will take place in a month's time. Mei's friends discover her transformation, but take a liking to it. Mei finds that concentrating on them enables her to control her transformations. Ming allows Mei to resume her normal life, but refuses to let Mei attend 4*Town's upcoming concert. Instead, the girls secretly raise money for the tickets at school by exploiting the popularity of Mei's red panda form while lying to Ming about how Mei is spending her time. To raise the last 100 dollars, Mei agrees to attend school bully Tyler's birthday party as the red panda. Before Mei leaves, Mei's grandmother and aunts arrive to assist with Mei's ritual. At the party, Mei is upset to discover that the concert will be on the night she is to undergo the ritual. In her rage, she attacks Tyler when he insults her family, frightening the other kids. Ming discovers Mei's activities and blames Mei's friends for everything. Mei fails to come to her friends' defense to maintain Ming's approval. While cleaning, Jin finds videos she recorded of herself as the red panda with her friends and tells her she should not be ashamed of this side of her, but to embrace it. During the ritual, as Mei's red panda form is about to be sealed, she decides to keep her powers and abandons the ritual to attend the concert at the SkyDome. In making her escape, she breaks Ming's talisman, releasing her red panda form as well. At the concert, Mei reconciles with her friends and Tyler. However, an enraged Ming, having become a kaiju-sized red panda, disrupts the concert while intending to take Mei back by force. Mei and Ming argue about the former's independence. As they fight, Mei accidentally knocks her mother unconscious. Mei's grandmother and aunts break their talismans to use their red panda forms to help drag Ming into a new ritual circle. Mei's friends and 4*Town join in singing to complete the ritual, sending Mei, Ming, and the other women to the astral plane. Mei reconciles with her mother and helps Ming mend her bond with her own mother, whom Ming accidentally scarred in anger in the past. The other women contain their red pandas in new talismans; but Mei decides to keep hers and Ming accepts that she is finding her own path. One year later, the Lee family raises money to repair the damage to the SkyDome. Mei and Ming's relationship has improved. Mei balances her temple duties (where her red panda form is now an attraction) and spends time with her friends and Tyler.",

    "title": "The Princess and the Frog",
    "plot": "In 1926, New Orleans, a young woman named Tiana dreams of opening a restaurant. She works two waitress jobs to earn money, leaving no time for a social life. Meanwhile, the arrogant Prince Naveen of Maldonia arrives in town, and intends to marry Tiana's wealthy best friend, Charlotte La Bouff, because his parents have cut him off from the family fortune. Charlotte's father, Big Daddy, hosts a masquerade ball in Naveen's honor. Charlotte asks Tiana to make beignets for the party, paying her enough to buy an old mill to convert into her restaurant. Naveen and his valet, Lawrence, encounter Dr. Facilier, an evil voodoo witch doctor who plans to rule New Orleans. Facilier transforms Naveen into a frog and Lawrence into a doppelganger of Naveen, using a voodoo talisman containing Naveen's blood. Facilier intends for the disguised Lawrence to marry Charlotte, then kill her father with a voodoo doll so he can gain the La Bouff fortune. At the ball, Tiana learns she has been outbid for the mill and accidentally spills food on her outfit, so Charlotte lends her a princess costume. Feeling disheartened, she begins wishing on a star when Naveen appears. Mistaking Tiana for an actual princess, he asks her to kiss him to break the spell, offering her a financial reward. Tiana reluctantly agrees to save her restaurant, but she is instead transformed into a frog as well. The two are chased into a nearby bayou, where they meet a jazz-loving anthropomorphic alligator named Louis. When they explain their predicament, he suggests they seek the help of Mama Odie, another voodoo practitioner who lives in the bayou. The trio come across a Cajun firefly named Ray who helps them find Mama Odie's abode. During the journey, Tiana and Naveen begin developing romantic feelings for each other, especially after Naveen learns to be more responsible. Meanwhile, the talisman containing Naveen's blood runs out. Facilier asks his \"friends on the other side\" (a legion of voodoo spirits) to help retrieve Naveen, offering them the souls of the city's population once he succeeds in taking over, and they grant him an army of shadow demons for his bidding. Mama Odie confirms that only Naveen kissing a princess can break the spell. Tiana realizes that since Charlotte's father has been crowned Mardi Gras king, Charlotte will be a princess until midnight. The group hitches a ride on a steamboat back to New Orleans, during which Naveen tells Ray about his love for Tiana and plans to propose marriage to her. After talking to Tiana, Naveen selflessly decides against proposing, since transforming him and Tiana into humans and financing Tiana's restaurant is contingent on him kissing Charlotte. The shadow demons capture Naveen and bring him to Facilier to replenish the talisman with Naveen's blood. After Ray tells Tiana of Naveen's love for her, Tiana heads to the Mardi Gras parade to find Naveen, only to see the disguised Lawrence marrying Charlotte. Ray rescues the real Naveen and steals the talisman, but is mortally wounded by Facilier, who then offers to make Tiana's dream come true in exchange for the talisman. She refuses to dishonor her father and destroys the talisman, leading the voodoo spirits to drag Facilier into their world for failing to pay back his debt. After Lawrence is arrested, Tiana reveals her love to Naveen. Charlotte agrees to kiss Naveen, but the clock strikes midnight before she can do so. Ray dies and is reincarnated as a star during his funeral. Tiana and Naveen are wed by Mama Odie and then restored to human form when they kiss, since Tiana is now truly a princess. They return to New Orleans and open their restaurant, named Tiana's Palace.",

    "plot": "Cybertron is a technological world formed by the body of the metal deity Primus and inhabited by sentient robots fueled by a substance called Energon, who live in a hierarchy based on whether they possess a 'transformation cog' that allows them to shapeshift into vehicles. In the underground city of Iacon, Orion Pax, a cogless mining robot, sneaks into an archive to learn about the first Cybertronians, the Thirteen Primes. Security guards spot Orion, but his best friend D-16 helps him escape. Later, during a cave-in in the Energon mine where they work, the two break protocol to save fellow miner Jazz. However, this worsens the disaster, and their superior, Elita-1, gets blamed for it and demoted by their callous overseer, Darkwing. Iacon's leader Sentinel Prime returns from an expedition to the surface to find the lost Matrix of Leadership; its absence caused Energon to stop flowing, forcing the miners to extract it. Though unable to find it, he reprieves the populace with a race. To prove themselves as more than miners, Orion enters himself and D-16 illicitly using jet packs, but they narrowly lose. While Sentinel promises to reward them for boosting mining morale, an enraged Darkwing drags them to garbage incineration for upstaging him in the race, where they meet the eccentric B-127. Finding a distress message from the Prime Alpha Trion in the garbage, Orion convinces D-16 and B-127 to travel with him to the message's coordinates on the surface; also persuading Elita to join when she catches them sneaking out of Iacon. The group finds Trion inside a cave, in stasis alongside the other Primes' corpses. Upon reactivation, he reveals that Sentinel is a pretender who betrayed the real Primes to steal the Matrix, only for it to disappear when Primus deemed him unworthy. In truth, Sentinel has been giving Energon to alien invaders called Quintessons in exchange for them letting him rule Cybertron, and he created the current hierarchy by removing some Cybertronians' cogs before activation. Trion gives the group the fallen Primes' cogs—allowing them to transform—and a chip with evidence of Sentinel's treason. They are then ambushed by Sentinel's lieutenant, Airachnid, who captures Trion and brings him back to Iacon, where Sentinel kills him. Evading pursuit, the group travels back to Iacon but is captured by the Primes' former army, the Cybertronian High Guard, who are rebelling against Sentinel. While D-16 takes command of them by defeating their leader, Starscream, Orion grows concerned over his increasing aggression. Sentinel's forces find them, and in the ensuing battle, the evidence chip is destroyed while D-16, B-127, and Starscream are captured along with most of the High Guard. Taken before Sentinel, D-16 learns that he stole the cog of his idol, Megatronus Prime, whose face Sentinel mockingly brands onto him. Encouraged by Elita, Orion rallies remaining High Guard members Soundwave and Shockwave and returns to Iacon to rescue their comrades. After subduing Darkwing, they enlist the miners' aid and assault Sentinel's headquarters, freeing the captives. As the High Guard battles Sentinel's forces, Orion, Elita, and B-127 expose the truth by capturing Airachnid and broadcasting her memory recordings throughout the city. D-16 defeats Sentinel but clashes with Orion over whether to kill him, resulting in D-16 accidentally shooting Orion before deliberately letting him fall to his death. D-16 then kills Sentinel, takes Megatronus' cog, renames himself Megatron, and starts rioting with the High Guard. Deeming Orion worthy, Primus and the Primes' spirits bestow him with the Matrix and revive him as Optimus Prime, who defeats Megatron and exiles him alongside the High Guard. The Matrix then makes Energon flow again and restores the miners' cogs. Afterward, Optimus becomes Iacon's new leader, christens his followers as Autobots, and sends a warning message for the Quintessons to stay away. Meanwhile, a furious Megatron reforms the High Guard into the Decepticons, using Megatronus' face as their insignia, and declares war on the Autobots.",

    "plot": "Craig Williams has just moved to Herkleton with his family and already feels displaced. After a rough night, Nicole tells Craig to take his younger sister Jessica to the playground. While playing on the swings, Jessica's stuffed toy, Small Uncle, accidentally gets flung into the Creek and Craig ventures in for the first time to get it. He encounters all the strange kids including trading kid Kit who just so happens to have it. The kids are attacked by a pirate crew led by Serena who intimidates Craig and takes Small Uncle. Craig is rescued by a fantasy obsessed girl named Kelsey, and her pet parakeet Mortimer, but after that, she demands to be paid, which Craig does in Choco-rolls. Later that night, Craig finds a diary in his room that belonged to the previous occupant Hannah, who reveals that she hid a wish maker somewhere in the Creek to hide from people like Serena. Craig resolves to find it so that he can wish for his old life back. He recruits Kelsey who reluctantly comes along. The two get a raft from Kit and venture down the Creek before encountering Serena and her pirates who imprison them. They encounter a gawky boy named J.P. who is a \"torturer\" in that nobody wants to be around him as he is bad at being bad. Serena reveals that she wants the wish maker so that she can flood the Creek. With J.P. switching sides, he, Craig, and Kelsey stage an escape. Serena convinces her crew to stay through the dinner horn while Craig, Kelsey, and J.P. hide in a tree stump and phone each other's parents to make it seem like they are having a sleepover. Kelsey and J.P. reveal that if they get to wish anything, they want people to understand them. As they sleep, Craig gets up and decides to continue his quest alone. Kelsey and J.P. wake up to discover Craig's deception, but are captured by Serena's crew. Craig finds the ancient playground and opens a hidden entrance to an underground temple-like area where he finds the wish maker. As he performs the commands to get a wish, he starts to reflect on his time with Kelsey and J.P. Just then, Serena arrives with her crew and takes the wish maker. Serena's wish is granted as the Creek suddenly begins to flood, but her crew abandons her out of fear and Serena is washed away. Craig, Kelsey, and J.P. take Serena's ship and after a motivational speech from Craig, the group steer the ship and find the wish maker on a rock along with Serena. While Craig activates the wish maker, Kelsey battles Serena, but she grabs it just as Craig finishes. Craig and Serena are transported to inside the wish maker where they battle each other using other kids' wishes. Craig later finds Serena's true wish, which was to return to her oceanside town which she was forced to move away from. Realizing that they shared the same wish, Craig convinces her to move on. The two of them wish for the Creek to be saved. The rains stop as the Creek returns to normal, but the wish maker is destroyed. The kids all return to playing at the Creek with Serena's former pirate crew now acting nicer to the other kids. Serena decides to continue exploring the Creek on her own as Craig finally returns Small Uncle to a thankful Jessica. He further writes a thank you letter to Hannah and mails her diary back to her. Craig, now with a new appreciation for the Creek and his friends, meets up with Kelsey and J.P. and suggests that they continue having adventures in the Creek so that they can draw a map of their own.",

    "plot": "Shrek and Princess Fiona are to succeed King Harold, but Shrek's attempts to serve as the Regent during Harold's medical absence end in disaster, because he is not interested in being king of Far, Far Away. With his dying breath, Harold tells Shrek of another heir: his nephew and Fiona's cousin, Arthur \"Artie\" Pendragon. Meanwhile, Prince Charming, vowing to avenge the death of his mother, the Fairy Godmother, and become king, goes to the Poison Apple tavern and persuades the fairy tale villains to fight for their \"happily ever after\", and help him take over Far Far Away. Shrek and his friends, Donkey, and Puss in Boots set out to retrieve Artie. As they sail away, Fiona reveals to Shrek that she is pregnant, much to Shrek's horror, because he believes he is incapable of raising children. The trio journey to Worcestershire Academy, an elite magical boarding school, where they discover that Artie is actually a scrawny, 16-year-old outcast. At the school pep rally, Shrek tells Artie he has been chosen to be king of Far, Far Away. Artie is excited until Donkey and Puss inadvertently frighten him by discussing the king's responsibilities. Losing confidence, Artie tries to take control of the ship and steer it back to Worcestershire. Following a scuffle with Shrek, the ship crashes on a remote island where they encounter Artie's retired magic teacher, Merlin, who convinces the two to open up to each other. Meanwhile, Fiona and Queen Lillian host a baby shower with a group of princesses when Charming and the villains attack the castle, but Gingy, Pinocchio, the Big Bad Wolf, and the Three Little Pigs stall Charming's group long enough for the ladies to escape. When one of the pigs accidentally reveals that Shrek has gone to retrieve Artie, Charming sends Captain Hook and his pirates to track them down. Meanwhile, Rapunzel, having fallen in love with Charming, betrays Fiona, and the ladies are locked in the castle dungeons. Captain Hook and his pirates catch up to Shrek on Merlin's island, where Shrek avoids capture, and Hook reveals Charming's takeover of Far, Far Away. Shrek urges Artie to return to Worcestershire, but Artie tricks Merlin into using his magic to send them to Far Far Away, and while the spell works, it accidentally causes Puss and Donkey to switch bodies. They find Pinocchio and learn that Charming plans to kill Shrek as part of a play, but they are caught and taken captive after breaking into the castle. Charming prepares to kill Artie to retain the crown, but Shrek saves his life by admitting that he was just using Artie to replace him as the next king. Charming allows a disheartened Artie to leave. Donkey and Puss are imprisoned with Fiona, Lillian and the other princesses, where Fiona grows frustrated with their lack of initiative, but Lillian frees them all by smashing an opening in the stone wall of the prison with a headbutt. While the princesses launch a rescue mission for Shrek, Donkey and Puss free Gingy, Pinocchio, and the others along with Dragon and Donkey's children, and then convince a leaving Artie that Shrek lied to save his life. Charming stages a showdown in a musical theater in front of the kingdom, and just as he is about to kill Shrek, Fiona, Puss, Donkey, the princesses and other fairy tale characters confront the villains, but they are quickly subdued. However, Artie shows up and gives a speech to the villains, convincing them that they can be accepted into society instead of being outcasts. Inspired by Artie's speech, the villains agree to give up their evil ways, while Charming refuses to listen and lunges at Artie with his sword. Shrek blocks the blow, and it appears that he has been stabbed. However, as Charming decrees himself the new king, Shrek reveals that Charming misaimed his sword and pushes him aside, while Dragon knocks the stage tower down onto Charming, killing him. With Charming defeated, Artie is crowned the new king of Far, Far Away. While the kingdom celebrates, Merlin appears and reverts Puss and Donkey's body swap. Later, back at the swamp, Shrek, having overcome his fear of parenthood, begins raising their new triplets, with help from Fiona, Donkey, Puss, Lillian, and Dragon.",

    "plot": "A benevolent queen gives birth during a snowstorm. To honor the day, she and her husband name their daughter Snow White. Years later, after the queen dies of a sudden illness, the king hastily remarries before embarking on a military campaign. When he disappears, the new queen usurps the throne, revealing herself as an enchantress whose vanity surpasses her beauty. Under the Evil Queen's rule, subjects are either left destitute or conscripted into the royal guard. Fearing that Snow White's beauty will outshine her own, the Queen confines Snow White to the palace, forces her to work as a scullery maid and asks a Magic Mirror daily who is \"the fairest one of all\". The Mirror always responds in her favor. One day, Snow White sees Jonathan, the leader of a band of bandits, raiding the pantry. When he is sentenced to be tied to the gates, she frees him. That same day, the Magic Mirror deems Snow White as the fairest. The Queen orders the Royal Huntsman to take Snow White into the forest, kill her, and bring her heart back in a jeweled box. The Huntsman instead warns Snow White of the Queen's intentions. At his urging, Snow White flees deep into the forest. Woodland animals lead Snow White to a secluded cottage, where she falls asleep. She awakens later that night to find herself confronted by the owners, the Seven Dwarfs who work in a diamond mine. They sympathize with her and agree to let her stay. Meanwhile, the Queen, having learned from the Magic Mirror that Snow White is still alive, imprisons the Huntsman before ordering a search. Snow White and Jonathan meet again in the forest and fend off the guards alongside the bandits. The two realize their feelings for each other before Jonathan departs to find the king, whom Snow White believes may still be alive. Jonathan is captured by the guards and imprisoned by the Queen, who deduces Snow White's whereabouts. Retreating to her secret chambers, she creates a magic poisoned apple that will put whoever eats it into a death-like sleep. Transforming into a peddler woman, the Queen goes to the cottage after the miners leave for work. Claiming to be an ally of Jonathan's, the Queen tricks Snow White into eating the apple; she then reveals to her stepdaughter that she killed her father. Snow White falls into a death-like sleep, and the Queen retreats to her castle. The miners find her sleeping body upon returning. Having escaped alongside the Huntsman, Jonathan arrives to discover her dead and mournfully kisses her. Snow White awakens and rallies the miners and Jonathan's bandits to overthrow the Evil Queen. Snow White confronts her stepmother, who forcefully goads her to take the throne, placing a diamond dagger into her hand. Snow White refuses to hurt her, reminding the people what the kingdom used to be like under her parents' rule. Moved, the guards turn on the Queen and join the miners, the bandits, the Huntsman, and the civilians. The Queen tries to attack Snow White, but the miners and bandits defend her. The Magic Mirror tells the Queen that Snow White will always be fairer than her due to her kindness and justness. Snow White arrives to see the Queen angrily destroying the Mirror, the source of her powers. As a result, she turns into glass herself and disappears into a vortex while the Magic Mirror repairs itself.

    "plot": "Kumandra, a prosperous land where humans live alongside dragons, is ravaged by the Druun, mindless spirits that petrify every living being in their path. Sisu, the last dragon, concentrates her magic into a gem and vanquishes the Druun, reviving Kumandra's people, but not its dragons. A power struggle for the gem divides Kumandra's people into five chiefdoms called Fang, Heart, Spine, Talon, and Tail, corresponding to their placement along a gigantic dragon-shaped river. 500 years later, Chief Benja of the Heart tribe retains possession of the gem and trains his young daughter Raya, a warrior princess, to protect it. Benja, believing Kumandra can be reunited, holds a feast for all five tribes. During the feast, Raya befriends Namaari, princess of the Fang tribe, who gives Raya a dragon pendant. Raya trusts Namaari and shows her the gem's chamber, but Namaari betrays her as part of a plot to help Fang steal the gem. After being alerted to the attack, Benja and the other tribes arrive and start fighting over the gem, breaking it into five pieces. The gem's destruction creates a fissure that releases the Druun, who quickly overrun the Land of Heart. The tribe leaders each steal a piece of the gem and flee. Benja notices water repels the Druun, and throws Raya into a river to save her before being petrified, resulting in his demise. Six years later, Raya treks across Kumandra to find Sisu, hoping she will create another gem and vanquish the Druun. In Tail, Raya summons Sisu, who reveals she did not create the gem but wielded it on behalf of her four siblings, all of whom contributed their magic to the gem. Raya and Sisu, who disguises as a human, resolve to reclaim the four pieces of the gem, reassemble it, and use it to vanquish the Druun and restore the petrified. Along the way, they meet Boun, a young restaurateur from Tail; Little Noi, an infant con artist from Talon; and Tong, a warrior from Spine; all of whom have lost loved ones to the Druun. Namaari, hoping to gain the gem shards for the Fang tribe, pursues Raya. Since each gem shard they acquire blesses Sisu with one of her siblings' magical powers, Raya, cautious of their new companions, insists Sisu remain disguised. In Spine, Sisu eventually reveals herself to save Raya from Namaari. In Fang, Sisu persuades Raya to propose an alliance with Namaari rather than steal the final shard. As a gesture of trust, Raya returns the pendant Namaari gave her years before. Namaari, torn between her responsibility to Fang and her wish to help defeat the Druun, threatens the party with a crossbow. Sisu tries to calm Namaari down, but Raya attacks with her whip sword after seeing Namaari's finger move on the trigger, causing the crossbow to fire and kill Sisu. With Sisu dead, all of the water drains away, allowing the Druun to overrun the realm. Enraged, Raya pursues Namaari, and the two fight while the others use the gem pieces to help the people of Fang evacuate, even while their power fades. Raya prepares to kill Namaari, but calms down when Namaari reminds her that her inability to trust others led to Sisu's death, and they go to aid the others. As the gem pieces' power begins to run out and the Druun near her group, Raya remembers how trust allowed Sisu to save the world. She urges the others to unite and reassemble the gem, showing her faith in Namaari by handing over her gem piece and allowing the Druun to petrify her. Boun, Tong, Noi, and her ongis follow suit, and Namaari reassembles the gem before also being petrified. This action unleashes a shockwave that spreads throughout Kumandra, vanquishing the Druun and conjuring up a magical rainstorm that restores the waters and revives everyone, including the dragons, who later revive Sisu. After the group reunites with their loved ones, the tribes and dragons gather at Heart to unite as Kumandra once again.",

    "plot": "An armed conflict forces young couple Alma and Pedro Madrigal to flee their home village in Colombia with their infant triplets, Julieta, Pepa, and Bruno. Pedro is killed, but the candle Alma carries gains a magical power that repels the attackers and creates Casita, a sentient house located in a magical realm bordered by mountains. Forty years later, a new village thrives under the candle's protection, which grants \"gifts\", and bedrooms also corresponding to their gifts, to each Madrigal descendant when they turn five, which they use to serve the villagers. Bruno was vilified and scapegoated for his precognition which resulted in his disappearance, while Julieta's youngest daughter, Mirabel, did not receive a gift. Ten years after that, Pepa's youngest son, Antonio, is granted the ability to communicate with animals. During the celebration, Mirabel sees Casita cracking and the candle's flame flickering and goes downstairs to investigate, thus missing the family photo. She also alerts her family, but Casita repairs itself before the other family members can see the cracks. After overhearing Alma lament the candle's fading that night, Mirabel resolves to restore Casita's magic herself. Her older sister Luisa, who possesses superhuman strength, confesses to Mirabel that she feels overwhelmed by her constant obligation to help the villagers using her strength, which has been faltering. She suggests to Mirabel that Bruno's room, located inside a forbidden tower in Casita, may hold the secret to the fading magic. Mirabel finds a cave in Bruno's room that holds pieces of his last vision made of opaque emerald. Alma and the family warn Mirabel not to investigate further, but she reassembles the pieces into the form of a tablet and sees herself with Casita cracking behind her. Mirabel’s father Agustín accidentally discovers her and warns her to keep the vision a secret, but they are overheard by Pepa's daughter Dolores, who possesses supernatural hearing. Mirabel's oldest sister Isabela, who can make plants and flowers instantly grow at will, is scheduled to be engaged to the Madrigals' neighbor Mariano Guzmán. Amidst Mariano's proposal, an awkward dinner, and Dolores telling everyone about Mirabel's discovery, Casita begins to crack again, and everyone loses control of their gifts. Mirabel follows rats carrying the pieces of the vision to a secret passage behind a portrait, where she finds Bruno, who reveals he never left Casita, and his visions alternate between Mirabel saving Casita and destroying it, leading him to believe she is the key to the fate of Casita's magic. Not wanting Mirabel to be hurt, he destroyed the vision and isolated himself. At Mirabel's insistence, Bruno conjures another vision that depicts Mirabel and Isabela, who have a strained relationship, hugging, which strengthens the candle. Mirabel attempts to apologize to Isabela, who confesses she is burdened by her image of perfection and does not want to marry Mariano. Mirabel helps Isabela use her powers more freely and they hug. Alma arrives and furiously blames Mirabel for causing the family's misfortunes out of spite for not having a gift. In response, Mirabel denounces Alma's behavior and asserts that her harmful expectations for her family are the true cause of Casita dying, which horrifies Alma. In the ensuing argument, Casita is demolished as the candle extinguishes, leaving the Madrigals powerless. Distraught, Mirabel runs away. Alma finds Mirabel tearfully sitting beside the river where Pedro was killed and the miracle had begun. Alma realizes that her obsession with preserving the magic made her oblivious to how her expectations and pressure were harming the family. She expresses remorse, reconciles with Mirabel, and reunites with Bruno. The three return to the village and assemble the other Madrigals to rebuild Casita, and the townspeople join in, restoring the family's gifts and reviving Casita. The Madrigals celebrate and take another family photo, this time including Mirabel and Bruno.",

Valdo then contacts All Might at U.A. to inform him of his plans to \"save Japan\", with All Might denouncing him; in response, Valdo dubs himself \"Dark Might\". Class 1-A is separated, and Izuku ends up in a mountain area after his Quirk suddenly stops working. He encounters Giulio, who fights off assailants before reluctantly allowing Izuku to accompany him. They enter another area, where Izuku finds the Gollini member responsible for the Quirk erasure in a dome, Paulo, and defeats him. Dark Might arrives, knocks Izuku out with incredible strength, and punishes Paulo for his failure by dropping him into a void. Giulio saves Izuku, and they head out. They eventually make their way to a city area, where Deborah has used her Day Dream Quirk on the civilians, including most of Class 1-A, forcing them all to touch Anna, with most falling unconscious after. Izuku and Giulio are also brainwashed, but the vestiges of One For All free the hypnotized Izuku. Izuku gets Giulio to wake up as Deborah attempts to kill him using a brainwashed civilian, allowing him to break her Quirk's control over everyone. As he reunites with Anna, Giulio once again attempts to shoot her, but Izuku stops him, allowing the Gollinis to escape with her. Giulio reveals that Anna's Quirk is \"Overmodification\": by touching people, she can greatly enhance their abilities, but only to certain compatible people, while others experience intense pain. Giulio's Quirk, \"Neutralization\", allows him to neutralize her Quirk temporarily, which led him to be hired by the wealthy Scervino family to care for Anna. However, the mafia learned of Anna's Quirk, murdered the entire family and kidnapped Anna. Giulio further reveals that Anna's Quirk will reach Quirk Singularity after overuse and that his own Quirk has been rendered unusable after losing his right arm during the Gollini's attack. Giulio has to fulfill his promise to Anna years ago: to kill her if her Quirk goes out of control. Izuku and Class 1-A firmly believe there is a way to save her as they prepare a counterattack. While Class 1-A fights against monsters created by the fortress and helps the civilians evacuate, Izuku, Katsuki Bakugo, Shoto Todoroki, and Giulio confront Dark Might and rescue Anna. Meanwhile, the fortress makes its way toward U.A., so the Heroes fend off the fortress while rescuing the escaping people. While Bakugo and Shoto deal with two Gollini's, Izuku and Giulio make it to Dark Might, who uses his enhanced \"Alchemy\" Quirk to simulate All Might's attacks and overwhelms Izuku; Deborah uses Anna to attempt to kill Giulio, but Giulio manages to defeat her again. Eventually, Izuku is joined by Bakugo and Shoto, and the three defeat Dark Might, revealing his true face. However, Anna's Quirk begins to go berserk, causing the fortress to deteriorate, and Dark Might becomes monstrous. Giulio helps Anna while the three students defeat Dark Might, with Izuku using his ultimate Smash to destroy the fortress. Giulio is revealed to be compatible with Anna, causing her Quirk to overload his Neutralization, rendering her Quirkless. As everyone recovers, Giulio tells Anna he no longer needs to watch over her. Anna convinces Giulio to stay with her now that she is free. Elsewhere, All For One, who has escaped from Tartarus, waits patiently as Tomura Shigaraki reawakens.",

    "title": "Hotel Transylvania",
    "plot": "In 1895, after his wife Martha was killed by an angry human mob, Count Dracula commissions and builds a massive monsters-only hotel in Transylvania, in which he raises his young daughter, Mavis. The hotel also serves as a safe haven and a getaway for the world's monsters from fear of human persecution. Famous monsters and friends of Dracula such as Frankenstein and his wife Eunice, Wayne and Wanda Werewolf and their massive immediate family, Griffin the Invisible Man, and Murray the Mummy often come to stay at the hotel. In 2012, on Mavis's 118th birthday, she wants to finally see the human world. Dracula allows her to leave the castle, but he sets up an elaborate plan using his zombie bellhops disguised as humans to make them seem intimidating, and frighten her home. The plan works, but on their way back the zombies inadvertently lead a human, Jonathan \"Johnny\" Loughran, back to the hotel. Drac frantically disguises him as a Frankensteinesque monster and passes him off as Frank's cousin \"Johnnystein\" so that he could lie about his arrival. Jonathan soon meets Mavis and the two \"zing\". Unable to get Johnny out of the hotel without notice, Drac quickly improvises that Johnny is a party planner, brought in to bring a fresher approach to his own traditional and boring parties. Johnny quickly becomes a hit to the other monsters, but this worries Drac, who is both envious of Johnny's popularity and afraid that his friends will never return to the hotel if they find out the truth about him. Drac coerces Johnny to leave, but he is brought back by Mavis, who is unaware of Johnny's real species and feud with her father. After being shown the beauty of a sunrise by Johnny, Mavis is inspired to give humans another chance. Meanwhile, the hotel chef Quasimodo, with the help of his pet rat Esmeralda, learns that Johnny is a human and kidnaps him to cook him. Drac intervenes and magically freezes Quasimodo to keep him from telling anyone that Johnny is human. Drac leads Johnny to his quarters and shows him a painting of Martha, allowing Johnny to realize why Drac built the hotel, became overprotective of Mavis, and his hatred for humans. Johnny then agrees to leave for good, but Drac, noticing that Mavis and Johnny's feelings for each other are real, persuades him to stay for the time being to avoid ruining Mavis's birthday. Drac and Johnny begin to bond and have fun together. The party is a great success the next night, and Mavis looks forward to opening a gift from Martha. However, when Johnny and Mavis share their first kiss, Drac overreacts, and in his outburst, inadvertently confesses to deceiving Mavis with the town. A still-frozen Quasimodo bursts in and Mr. Fly reveals from his frozen speech that Johnny is a human disguised by Drac, who is guilty about his lie. The guests are shocked and outraged by the deceit at play, but Mavis is undeterred and wants to be with Johnny. Johnny rejects her out of respect for her father and leaves the hotel. A heartbroken Mavis flies onto the roof with her mother's gift, and Drac follows in hopes of comforting her. He learns the present is a book about how he and Martha \"zinged\" and fell in love, and realizes he no longer knows mankind’s true tolerance of monsters. After apologizing to the patrons, Drac persuades Frank, Wayne, Griffin, and Murray to head out into the human world to help him find Johnny, and with the scent-tracking ability of Wayne's daughter, Winnie, they learn that he is about to catch a flight back to the United States. The five head to the airport, but are held up in a town celebrating a Monster Festival along the way. Frankenstein attempts to scare away the assembled crowd of humans with a loud roar but instead receives wild applause and adoration. He then gets the humans to agree to help, and a team of men dressed as vampires provides Drac shelter from the sunlight while he rushes to the airport. Drac arrives to see Johnny's plane taking off, and he gives chase in bat form, burning in the sunlight. After getting Johnny's attention, Drac makes his way to the windshield of the plane and uses his mind-controlling power on the pilot to help him apologize over the plane's PA system, stating that Mavis has grown up and can make her own decisions. Johnny accepts his apology, and Drac manipulates the pilot to return to the Transylvanian airport. Drac returns Johnny to Mavis, announcing that he approves of Johnny. Johnny confesses to Mavis that their \"zing\" was mutual and the two kiss. The monsters finish celebrating Mavis's party, impressing the hotel guests.",

    "plot": "Five years after competing in the World Grand Prix, Lightning McQueen, now a seven-time Piston Cup champion, finds himself overshadowed by Jackson Storm, a rookie who is the first among a new generation of race cars with advanced technology to enhance speed and performance. As Storm wins throughout the season, many racing veterans retire or are replaced by younger racers. In the final race at Los Angeles, Lightning briefly leads but falls behind after being overtaken by Storm and the other next-gen cars. He struggles to keep up, loses control, and crashes after hitting the wall, prematurely ending his worst season on record. Four months later, Lightning, who has since recovered from his crash, decides that he will continue racing and calls his sponsors, Rusty and Dusty, who reveal they have sold Rust-eze to a wealthy business car named Sterling. Sterling assigns Lightning to train at the Rust-eze Racing Center under Cruz Ramirez, where he struggles to adapt to the modern training methods. After Lightning accidentally damages a simulator, Sterling tries to force him to retire. Adamant that he can still race, Lightning offers that if he wins the upcoming Florida 500, he can decide if he wants to keep racing; otherwise, he will retire immediately. Sterling reluctantly accepts the deal, but on the condition that Cruz must go with him. Cruz's unconventional training methods and lack of real-world racing experience frustrate Lightning as they attempt to record his top speed at Fireball Beach. When Lightning decides to train at the Thunder Hollow Speedway, they realize it is being used for a figure-8 style demolition derby called the \"Crazy Eight\" and are forced to participate, in which Cruz wins and accidentally reveals him to the public. Lightning angrily yells at Cruz after the demolition derby and accidentally breaks her trophy. Cruz reveals that she had always wanted to be a racer but was never confident enough to enter a race, so she resigns as Lightning's trainer and heads back to the racing center. Ashamed and without other options, Lightning calls his friend Mater for advice, who suggests that Lightning track down Doc Hudson's mentor and crew chief Smokey in his hometown of Thomasville, Georgia. Hence, Lightning catches up to Cruz and convinces her to rejoin him. In Thomasville, they meet up with Smokey, who reveals that, even though Doc never raced again, he found new happiness in training Lightning. After Lightning accepts that he will never be as fast as Storm, Smokey and Doc's old friends, Louise \"Barnstormer\" Nash, River Scott, and Junior \"Midnight\" Moon, help him learn new tricks to overcome his speed disadvantage, using Cruz as his sparring partner. After many attempts, Lightning finally manages to pass Cruz during the final practice race. However, Cruz suddenly overtakes Lightning, which causes him to remember being passed by Storm before his crash, shaking his confidence. At the Florida 500, Lightning starts at the back but moves up the ranks with Smokey's help. Sterling doubts Lightning's capability and orders Cruz back to the training center, despite her desire to stay. Hearing them on his radio and recalling Cruz's racing dream, Lightning sidesteps a huge pile-up and has his crew prep Cruz to race in his place, giving her a chance to succeed. Though initially hesitant, Cruz starts overtaking cars with Lightning's coaching. She ends up behind Storm, who threatens her by ramming her against the wall on the final lap. Using an old move from Doc Hudson, Cruz flips over Storm, overtakes him, and wins the race. As Cruz celebrates her victory, Sterling offers her a role on his team, but she instead takes a counteroffer from Dinoco's owner Tex Dinoco. Since Lightning and Cruz were both wearing #95, Lightning becomes the joint-winner of the race and effectively passes his deal with Sterling. Returning to Radiator Springs, Lightning reveals that Tex has bought Rust-eze from Sterling. Now decked in Doc's old racing colors, Lightning decides to continue racing but trains Cruz first for the rest of the season.",

    "plot": "After finishing a concert at Lake Springfield, Green Day tries to engage the audience in a discussion about the environment, but they refuse to listen and throw garbage at them. The pollution in the lake erodes the band's barge, causing them to drown. During their memorial, Grampa Simpson has a spiritual experience and prophesies that a disaster will befall Springfield, which only Marge takes seriously. Concerned about the terrible state of the environment, Lisa and her new boyfriend Colin hold a seminar and convince the town to clean up the lake. Meanwhile, Homer and Bart engage in a dare contest, in which Homer dares Bart to skateboard to Krusty Burger and back naked. After Bart is caught by the police, Homer has Bart take the blame for the dare. At Krusty Burger, Homer adopts a pig to save him from being slaughtered by Krusty the Clown. When Homer brings the pig back home, Marge identifies the pig as a part of the prophecy and warns Homer to get rid of him, but Homer refuses and names him \"Plopper\". Homer's fawning over Plopper makes Bart, now fed up with Homer's carelessness, look to Ned Flanders as a father figure. Marge orders Homer to dispose of an overflowing silo full of Plopper's feces (and some of Homer's own, as well). Rather than disposing of it safely, he becomes distracted after hearing that Lard Lad is giving away free donuts and hastily dumps the silo in the lake, critically polluting it. After a squirrel falls into the lake and becomes mutated, Russ Cargill, head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), informs President Arnold Schwarzenegger of Springfield's pollution crisis and presents him with five solutions. Schwarzenegger randomly picks the third option – sealing Springfield off from the rest of the world under a giant glass dome. Being trapped under the dome causes mass hysteria in Springfield and when Homer's silo is discovered on the news, hundreds of townspeople arrive at the Simpsons' house in an attempt to lynch the family. They escape through a sinkhole hidden under Maggie's sandbox, which destroys the house. The family is furious at Homer for his blundering, but he convinces them to follow him to Alaska, where he had always planned to go if something like the incident happened. Homer wins a truck by riding a motorcycle around a globe of death and the family restarts their lives in a remote Alaskan cabin. As Springfield begins exhausting its supplies, the townspeople eventually attack the dome and the city descends into chaos. Cargill, mad with the power he has over Springfield and outraged by their defiance, tricks Schwarzenegger into ordering the town's demolition. The Simpsons see Tom Hanks on television advertising a \"new Grand Canyon\" on the site of Springfield. Realizing that their hometown is in danger, the family vow to save it sans Homer, who refuses to leave Alaska and storms out. When he returns the next morning, he finds his family has left to save Springfield, with Marge taping a message over their wedding video to explain this to him. A distraught Homer is recovered by an Inuk shaman, who helps him come to an epiphany about his selfishness; he decides to save the town and his family. Meanwhile, Marge and the kids are captured by the EPA in Seattle and placed back inside the dome. The EPA lowers a time bomb suspended by a rope through a hole at the top of the dome. While the townspeople attempt climbing the rope to escape, Homer returns to Springfield and descends the rope, knocking the escaping townspeople and the bomb off, inadvertently shortening its countdown and further provoking the town's ire. Refusing to give up, Homer reconciles with Bart and they use a motorcycle to travel up the side of the dome with the bomb. Bart throws the bomb through the hole seconds before it detonates, shattering the dome and freeing the town. Cargill attempts to murder Homer and Bart for foiling his plan, but Maggie knocks him out by dropping a rock on his head. The townspeople forgive and praise Homer before he rides into the sunset with Marge as Springfield begins restoration.",

    "plot": "In Medieval Scotland, a young Princess Merida of Clan Dunbroch celebrates her birthday and is given a bow and arrow by her father, King Fergus, dismaying his wife Queen Elinor. In the forest, Merida encounters a will-o'-the-wisp and follows the other wisps to her family and Mor'du, a huge demon bear, attacks the family. Fergus and his men fend off Mor'du, though the fight costs Fergus one of his legs. Ten years later, Merida discovers she is to be betrothed to the son of one of her father's allies. Failure to consent to the betrothal could harm Dunbroch; Elinor reminds Merida of a legend of a prince whose pride and refusal to follow his father's wishes destroyed his kingdom. The allied clan chieftains and their first-born sons arrive to compete in the Highland games for Merida's hand in marriage. Twisting the rules, Merida announces that, as her own clan's firstborn, she will compete for her own hand. She easily bests her suitors and, after arguing with Elinor, runs away into the forest. She encounters the wisps again, who lead her to the hut of an elderly witch, where she bargains for a spell to \"change\" Elinor. The witch gives her an enchanted cake. Elinor eats the cake and is transformed into a bear, unable to speak but retaining most of her human consciousness. Merida returns to the deserted witch's cottage, and discovers a message from the witch: she must \"mend the bond, torn by pride\" by the second sunrise, or the spell will become permanent. Merida and Elinor encounter Mor'du and realize Mor'du was the prince in the legend. Merida vows not to let the same thing happen to her mother, and concludes she needs to repair the family tapestry she deliberately damaged during their argument. They return to the castle to find the clans on the verge of war. Merida intends to declare herself ready to choose a suitor as tradition demands, but at Elinor's prompting, she instead allows the firstborns to marry in their own time to whomever they choose. The clans agree, breaking tradition but renewing their alliance. Losing her humanity, Elinor attacks Fergus and flees the castle. Mistaking the Queen for Mor'du, Fergus pursues the bear with the other clans, locking Merida in the castle. Merida escapes with the assistance of her triplet brothers, who have become bear cubs after eating the enchanted cake. She repairs the tapestry as Fergus and the clans capture Elinor. Merida thwarts them before the real Mor'du arrives. Mor'du targets Merida, but Elinor intercedes, causing Mor'du to be crushed by a falling menhir. This releases the spirit of the prince, who thanks Merida for freeing him and transforms into a wisp. As the sun rises for the second time, Merida covers Elinor in the repaired tapestry, but she remains a bear. Thinking it was for nothing, Merida reconciles with her mother begging to have her back, unknowingly fulfilling the true meaning of the witch's message. This reverses the spell's effects on her mother and brothers. With Mor'du gone, Merida and Elinor work together on a new tapestry, bid farewell to the other clans, and ride their horses together.",

    "plot": "King Agnarr of Arendelle tells his daughters Elsa and Anna that their grandfather, King Runeard, forged a treaty with the neighboring tribe of Northuldra by building a dam in their homeland, the Enchanted Forest. A fight occurred, resulting in Runeard's death and enraging the forest's classical elements of earth, fire, water, and air. The elements disappeared, and a wall of mist trapped everyone in the forest; Agnarr barely escaped, helped by an unknown savior. Three years after her coronation, Elsa celebrates autumn in the kingdom with Anna, the snowman Olaf, the iceman Kristoff, and Kristoff's reindeer Sven. One night, Elsa hears a mysterious voice calling her. She follows it, unintentionally awakening the elemental spirits, who are forcing everyone in the kingdom to evacuate. The Rock Troll colony arrives, and Grand Pabbie tells the sisters they must set things right by uncovering the truth about the past. Elsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff and Sven follow the mysterious voice, and travel to the Enchanted Forest. The mist parts at Elsa's touch, while the air spirit appears as a tornado, catching everyone in its vortex until Elsa stops it by turning the vortex into ice sculptures that show images from their father's past. Elsa also befriends the fire spirit, who is an agitated magical salamander. They later encounter the Northuldra and a troop of Arendellian soldiers who are still in conflict with one another. Anna and Elsa arrange a truce between the soldiers and the Northuldra after discovering that their mother, Queen Iduna, was a Northuldran who had saved the Arendellian Agnarr. The Northuldra tell them about a fifth spirit, who is meant to reunite the people with the magic of nature. While Kristoff and Sven stay with the Northuldra, Elsa, Anna, and Olaf continue north. They find their parents' wrecked ship and a map with a route to Ahtohallan, a mythical river said to explain the past. Believing she should continue alone, Elsa sends Anna and Olaf to safety despite Anna's protests. She encounters and tames the Nøkk, the water spirit who guards the sea to Ahtohallan. Elsa discovers that the voice calling to her is the memory of young Iduna and that her powers are a gift from nature because of Iduna's selfless saving of Agnarr. Venturing into the most dangerous part of Ahtohallan, she learns that the dam was built as a ruse to reduce Northuldran resources because of Runeard's contempt for the tribe's connection with magic, and that he began the conflict by murdering the Northuldran leader in cold blood. Elsa relays this information to Anna before freezing solid, which in turn causes Olaf to fade away from existence. Upon discovering the truth, Anna concludes that the dam must be destroyed for peace to be restored and the forest to be freed. She awakens the earth spirit, Jötunn, and lures it towards the dam. The massive rock giants hurl boulders, destroying the dam and sending a flood down the fjord towards the kingdom. Elsa thaws and rides the Nøkk to Arendelle, where she freezes the flood and saves the kingdom. As the mist disappears, she rejoins Anna and revives Olaf, before Kristoff proposes to Anna. Realizing she is the fifth spirit herself, Elsa explains to Anna that they are the bridge between the people and the magical spirits. Elsa abdicates the throne to Anna and becomes the protector of the Enchanted Forest, visiting Arendelle regularly with peace restored. In a post-credits scene, Olaf visits Elsa's ice palace and recounts the events to Marshmallow, the snow giant created by Elsa as palace guard, and the Snowgies, miniature snowmen inadvertently generated by Elsa from sneezing.",

Mahito's father Shoichi, an air munitions factory owner, marries his late wife's sister, Natsuko, and they evacuate to her rural estate. Mahito, distant to the pregnant Natsuko, encounters a peculiar grey heron leading him to a sealed tower, the last known location of Natsuko's architect granduncle. After a school fight, Mahito deliberately injures himself. The heron, now speaking, entices Mahito with promises of finding his mother. Mahito is nearly taken by a swarm of creatures, but Natsuko saves him with a whistling arrow, inspiring him to craft his own bow and arrow. The arrow is magically imbued with true aim after it is fletched with the heron's feather. Mahito's reading of a book left by Hisako is interrupted when an ill Natsuko disappears into the forest. Leading one of the estate's elderly maids, Kiriko, into the tower, Mahito is deceived by a watery imitation of his mother made by the heron, which dissolves at his touch. Affronted, he pierces the heron's beak with his arrow, revealing a flightless creature, the Birdman, living inside it. A wizard appears, ordering the Birdman to guide Mahito and Kiriko as all three sink into the floor. Mahito descends into an oceanic world. He is rescued from attacking pelicans and a forbidding, megalithic dolmen by a younger Kiriko, an adept fisherwoman who uses fire through a magic wand. They catch and sell a giant fish to bubble-like spirits called Warawara, which fly to the world above to be reborn. A pyrokinetic young woman, Himi, protects Warawara from predation by the pelicans. A dying pelican explains that their species is desperate to survive after being introduced to this world with no other food. Kiriko mediates peace between Mahito and the Birdman, and Mahito plugs the Birdman's beak, restoring his flight. The two are separated by anthropomorphic, man-eating parakeets. Himi saves Mahito and shows him a counterpart of the tower which contains doors to many worlds. They enter a door leading back to Natsuko's estate and are spotted by Shoichi, but Mahito returns through the door to continue his search for Natsuko. Infiltrating the parakeets' kingdom, Mahito finds Natsuko in a delivery room. Natsuko rebuffs him, and Mahito calls her his mother. Himi incinerates the paper attacking them, but all three are rendered unconscious by the encounter. In a dream, Mahito meets the wizard, Natsuko's granduncle. The wizard, preoccupied with a stack of stone toy blocks representing their dimension, requests Mahito, possessing the power of his bloodline, to succeed in the custodianship of this world. Mahito notices that the blocks are infused with malice. Waking up, he is freed from captivity by the Birdman. They climb the tower to pursue the Parakeet King, who is delivering Himi to the wizard, hoping to convince him to maintain the world. The wizard has collected replacement blocks free of malice for Mahito and implores him to build a better world with them. Mahito refuses, acknowledging his own malice embodied by his self-inflicted scar, and vows instead to embrace those who love him. The Parakeet King takes the blocks and tries to build a better world himself, but the stack is too unstable and falls. The world begins to collapse and flood, and Mahito, Himi, and the Birdman escape, reuniting with Natsuko and young Kiriko. Learning that Himi is his birth mother, Mahito warns her of her fate, but she returns to her own time without worry. Mahito returns with Natsuko, amidst an exodus of animals that revert to non-anthropomorphic forms. The Birdman notices Mahito keeping a stone of power, and advises him to forget his experiences. A charm doll carried by Mahito transforms back into the old Kiriko. Two years after the war, Mahito moves back to Tokyo with his father, Natsuko, and his new brother.",

While she and her siblings are on an outing with their father in his four-flippered submarine, Brunhilde sneaks off and floats away on the back of a jellyfish. After an encounter with a fishing trawler, she becomes trapped in a glass jar and drifts to the shore of a small fishing town where she is rescued by a five-year-old boy named Sōsuke. While shattering the jar with a rock, Sōsuke cuts his finger. Brunhilde licks his blood, healing the wound almost instantly. Sōsuke names her Ponyo and promises to protect her. Meanwhile, a distraught Fujimoto searches frantically for his lost daughter whom he believes to have been kidnapped. He calls his wave spirits to recover her, leaving Sōsuke heartbroken and confused by what happened. Ponyo refuses to let her father call her by her birth name, declaring her desire to be a human named Ponyo. She magically begins changing into a human, a power granted to her by Sōsuke's human blood that she licked. Fujimoto forces her back into her true form and leaves to summon Ponyo's mother, Gran Mamare. Meanwhile, Ponyo, with the help of her sisters, breaks away from her father and inadvertently uses his magic to make herself human. The huge amount of magic that she releases into the ocean causes an imbalance in nature, resulting in a tsunami. Ponyo goes back to Sōsuke, who is amazed and overjoyed to see her. His mother, Lisa, allows her to stay at their house. Lisa leaves after the tsunami subsides to check up on the residents of the nursing home where she works, promising Sōsuke that she will return home as soon as possible. Gran Mamare arrives at Fujimoto's submarine. Sōsuke's father, Kōichi, sees her traveling and recognizes her as the Goddess of Mercy. Fujimoto notices the moon appears to be falling out of its orbit and satellites are falling like shooting stars, symptoms of the dangerous imbalance of nature that now exists. Gran Mamare reassures him, and declares that if Sōsuke can pass a test, Ponyo can live as a human and the balance of nature will be restored. Fujimoto, still worried, reminds her that if Sōsuke fails the test, Ponyo will turn into sea foam. The next day, Sōsuke and Ponyo find that most of the land around the house has been covered by the ocean. Since it is impossible for Lisa to come home, the two decide to find her. With Ponyo's magic, they make Sōsuke's pop-pop boat bigger to traverse the waters, seeing marine life from the Late Devonian period and more people on boats. When they reach the forest, however, Ponyo tires and falls asleep, and the boat slowly reverts to its original size. Sōsuke drags Ponyo to the shore, where he finds Lisa's abandoned car. As they continue walking, Ponyo mysteriously reverts to her fish form. Meanwhile, Gran Mamare grants Lisa and the residents of the nursing home the temporary ability to breathe in water.

    "plot": "Ellie is pregnant, making Manny desperate to make life safe for both her and their upcoming child, not wanting them to meet the same fate as his previous wife and child. However, Manny's desperation alienates Diego, who contemplates leaving the herd, feeling like he's losing his hunter instincts. On the other hand, Sid becomes anxious about being abandoned, leading him to discover three apparently abandoned eggs underground that he decides to adopt. Manny tells Sid to return the eggs, but Sid ignores him and looks after them, hatching into baby Tyrannosaurs the following day. Meanwhile, Scrat battles a flying saber-tooth squirrel named Scratte for his acorn. Although Sid tries his best to raise the dinosaurs, their rambunctious behavior scares away the younger animals and destroys the playground Manny built for his child, angering Manny. The mother Tyrannosaurus, whose eggs Sid took, arrives. When Sid refuses to return her children, she carries both Sid and her children underground. The two mammoths and possums follow them, discovering that the icy cave leads to a vast subterranean lost world populated by dinosaurs. After escaping a territorial dinosaur and reuniting with Diego, they are surrounded by more dinosaurs, but are saved by a one-eyed weasel named Buck. Buck reveals he has lived in the jungle for a long time, and is trying to hunt down Rudy, a monstrous albino Baryonyx who took Buck's missing eye. He agrees to lead the group through the jungle to Lava Falls, where the mother dinosaur takes Sid and her babies. Meanwhile, the mother Tyrannosaurus tries to get rid of Sid, but slowly grows attached to him. The following day, however, Sid is separated and chased by Rudy. Sid escapes, but gets stranded on a loose rock floating on a river of lava, heading to plummet over the falls. Nearing lava falls, Ellie enters labor, and a pack of Guanlong causes a rock slide that separates her from the rest. Buck commands Manny and Diego to stay behind to protect Ellie while he and the possums rescue Sid. Diego regains his edge from defeating the Guanlong while supporting Ellie emotionally as she gives birth. Manny slows down the rest as he makes his way up to her. Buck, Crash, and Eddie ride a Harpactognathus to Lava Falls, but a pack of Quetzalcoatlus follow, preying on the possums and forcing them to detour through a canyon. They defeat the Quetzalcoatlus, and return to Lava Falls just in time to rescue Sid. Back at the plates, the remaining Guanlong are defeated with Manny reaching Ellie just in time to see his newborn daughter, agreeing to name the baby \"Peaches\". Sid is happy to reunite with his friends, but is sad that he never had a chance to say goodbye to the Tyrannosaurus. Before leaving the jungle, they are ambushed by Rudy, but the herd is eventually saved by the mother Tyrannosaurus, who charges at Rudy and knocks him off a cliff. Sid then says goodbye to the dinosaurs, and Buck, now without a purpose in life since Rudy is gone, decides to join the herd and live on the surface. However, a distant roar tells him that Rudy is still alive. Changing his mind, he sends the herd home and blocks off the path to the lost world. Manny and Ellie welcome Peaches into their frozen world, and Diego decides to remain with the herd, while Buck stays underground, trying to tame Rudy. Meanwhile, Scrat and Scratte, having continued their fight into the dinosaur world, fall in love and decide to live in the jungle together. Still, Scratte suddenly becomes bossy, making Scrat choose the acorn over her. Scratte catches him and takes away the acorn, causing a fight. Scrat is accidentally launched back to the surface, while the acorn and Scratte are trapped in the dinosaur world.",

    "plot": "In a world populated by anthropomorphic vehicles, the Dinoco 400 race marks the climax of the Piston Cup season. The event intensifies a rivalry between the retiring seven-time champion, Strip \"The King\" Weathers, the cunning Chick Hicks, and the talented but overconfident rookie, Lightning McQueen, who are all tied for the most points. Lightning is desperate to win and leave the unglamorous sponsorship of Rust-eze for the prestigious Dinoco, and struggles with teamwork due to his self-centered attitude. During the high-stakes race, Lightning blows his lead by refusing to take a pit stop, causing his rear tires to blow out before he can win. The race ends in a three-way tie, setting the stage for a decisive race at the Los Angeles International Speedway in one week. After the race, Lightning rushes through the night on the interstate to reach California inside his transport truck Mack. A mishap leaves Lightning stranded alone in the rundown desert town of Radiator Springs, Arizona. Here, he inadvertently damages the main road, leading to him being sentenced to a community service assignment: repaving the road under the supervision of the town's judge, Doc Hudson, who is prejudiced against Lightning for being a race car. Lightning repaves the road shoddily in a rush to leave, and Doc challenges him to a race for his freedom, on the condition that he starts over from scratch if he loses. The overconfident Lightning, having never raced on a dirt road before, spins out on a turn and crashes into a cactus patch, with Doc having set up the race to dampen his ego. Over time, Lightning warms up to and befriends the town's residents, especially Mater, a rusty tow truck, and Sally, who dreams of reviving Radiator Springs. As he bonds with the locals, Lightning helps rejuvenate Radiator Springs and develops a newfound appreciation for its charm. He discovers the town was once a bustling attraction for drivers on Route 66, before the construction of the interstate caused them to lose all their business traffic. Lightning also discovers that the bitter Doc, reticent about his past, used to race as the legendary Hudson Hornet until a disastrous crash ended his career. Lightning is dumbfounded that Doc considers his previous Piston Cups worthless junk. Lightning finishes repairing the road and decides to spend an extra day in Radiator Springs helping the local businesses, but Doc alerts the media to Lightning's location, leading them and Mack to descend on the town and force Lightning to leave in time for the race. Doc regrets his actions after seeing the residents disappointed by his departure. At the race, Lightning initially struggles, but is reinvigorated by the arrival of his friends from Radiator Springs, who act as his pit crew. With Doc taking over from Mack as crew chief, Lightning stages a remarkable comeback. However, Chick employs a PIT maneuver that intentionally damages the King, rendering him unable to continue. Fearing that the King's career may end as Doc's did, Lightning halts just before the finish line and pushes him across, allowing Chick to win the Piston Cup while ensuring the King's safe finish. The crowd and media condemn Chick's victory and praise Lightning's integrity and sportsmanship. Lightning is offered the Dinoco sponsorship, but declines out of newfound loyalty to Rust-eze. Returning to Radiator Springs, he reunites with Sally and declares his intention to establish his racing headquarters there, revitalizing the town.",

    "plot": "On 4 May, 1865, in a park in Oxford, England, a young girl named Alice listens distractedly to her sister's history lesson, and begins daydreaming of a nonsensical world. She spots a passing White Rabbit in a waistcoat, who complains of being late. Alice chases him into a burrow and plummets down a deep hole. Upon landing, she finds herself facing a tiny door, whose handle advises drinking from a bottle on a nearby table. She shrinks to an appropriate height, but has forgotten the key on the table. She then eats a cookie that causes her to grow excessively. Exasperated by these changes of state, she begins to cry and floods the room. She takes another sip from the bottle to shrink again, and rides the empty bottle through the keyhole. As Alice continues to follow the Rabbit, she encounters Tweedledum and Tweedledee, who recount the tale of \"The Walrus and the Carpenter\". Alice tracks the Rabbit to his house; he mistakes her for his housemaid and sends her inside to retrieve his gloves. While searching for the gloves, Alice finds and eats a cookie and grows giant, getting stuck in the house. Thinking her a monster, the Rabbit asks the Dodo to help expel her. Before the Dodo can burn the house down, Alice escapes by eating a carrot from the Rabbit's garden and shrinking to three inches tall. Alice meets a garden of talking flowers who initially welcome her with a song, but then banish her, accusing her of being a weed. Alice then encounters a Caterpillar, who becomes enraged at Alice after she laments her small size (which is the same as the Caterpillar's). The Caterpillar turns into a butterfly and flies away after advising Alice to eat a piece from different sides of a mushroom to alter her size. Following a period of trial and error, she returns to her original height and keeps the remaining pieces on hand. In the woods, Alice gets stuck between multiple paths and encounters the Cheshire Cat, who suggests questioning the Mad Hatter or the March Hare. Taking her own path, Alice encounters both, along with the Dormouse, in the midst of an \"unbirthday\" celebration. Alice attempts to explain her predicament, but becomes frustrated by the Hatter and Hare's interruptions and absurd logic. The Rabbit appears and the Hatter attempts to repair his pocket watch, which results in its destruction, and the Rabbit is thrown out of the party. Alice abandons her pursuit and decides to go home, but gets lost in the Tulgey Wood. The Cheshire Cat appears to the despondent Alice and offers a path to the Queen of Hearts. In the Queen's labyrinthine garden, Alice witnesses the Queen – whom the Rabbit serves as a chamberlain – sentencing a trio of playing cards to execution for painting mistakenly-planted white rosebushes red. The Queen invites Alice to a croquet match, in which live flamingos, card guards, and hedgehogs are used as equipment, but the equipment rig the game in favor of the Queen. The Cheshire Cat reappears and plays a trick on the Queen, setting up Alice to be framed. The King spares Alice by suggesting a formal trial, in which the Cheshire Cat invokes more chaos by having Alice point him out, causing one of the witnesses – the Dormouse – to panic. As the Queen orders Alice's execution, Alice eats the mushroom pieces to grow large, momentarily intimidating the court. However, the mushroom's effect is short-lived, forcing Alice to flee the deteriorating realm and its pursuing denizens. When Alice reaches the small door she encountered, she sees herself sleeping through the keyhole. Alice emerges from her dream, and she returns home for tea with her sister.",

    "plot": "After the destruction of the Cloud Catcher and Mayor Humdinger's arrest, meteoriticist Victoria Vance steals a giant electromagnet from Hank and Janet's scrapyard, inadvertently setting a fire that traps the owners. Janet sends Ryder and the Paw Patrol pups to extinguish the fire. At Adventure City, the citizens gather for a meteor shower, while Ryder introduces the Paw Patrol to Nano, Mini, and Tot, three Pomeranians who wish to be part of the team as Junior Patrollers. Meanwhile, Victoria travels to an abandoned observatory and creates a Meteor Magnet from what she stole, hoping to attract an incoming magical meteor. The machine malfunctions, causing the meteor to head for Paw Tower. Ryder and the pups evacuate the tower, and help the civilians escape before the meteor damages the tower and the street below it; the Paw Patrol takes the rock to their Aircraft Carrier headquarters for analysis. That night, Skye awakens as the meteor rock begins to glow. It splits to reveal seven crystals, one of which grants her the powers of flight and super strength. The other pups each take a crystal to gain powers themselves, but as Liberty seems to have no abilities, Ryder assigns her to train the Junior Patrollers. Victoria, having been arrested for public endangerment, escapes prison with Humdinger and the Kitten Catastrophe Crew. Inside Humdinger's private airplane, the group plans to trap the Paw Patrol, who have now re-branded as \"the Mighty Pups\". Victoria deliberately destroys one of the plane's engines and calls Ryder, who sends Skye to investigate. Victoria steals Skye's crystal and parachutes out of the plane alongside Humdinger and the kittens, except for Skye. Ryder and the other pups clear Main Street so Skye can land the damaged plane. Back at the Aircraft Carrier, Skye tells Chase that having superpowers was the first time in her life she did not feel like the smallest and weakest; having been born a runt, she was often overlooked, leading her to run off in a blizzard to join the Paw Patrol. Taking the other pups' crystals, Skye attempts to retrieve hers from the villains, but Victoria, having acquired superpowers of her own, captures Skye and steals the rest of the crystals. When Skye tries to reason with Victoria and warn her of the consequences of using the Meteor Magnet to attract more meteors, Victoria reveals to Skye that she was bullied by her colleagues in her former group for her meteor obsession and called her a mad scientist and Skye realizes that Victoria also feels small, insignificant, overlooked and unimportant like her, she unsuccessfully attempts to sympathize with her. After learning of what has happened, the rest of the Paw Patrol and Junior Patrollers fight and subdue Humdinger, who has used one of the crystals from Victoria to grow into a giant. Marshall retrieves the crystal, and Humdinger is rearrested. The Paw Patrol follows the crystal's signature to the observatory, where the Junior Patrollers distract Victoria so Zuma can rescue Skye. The pups each take turns using Humdinger's crystal as they fight Victoria. During the battle, Chase falls off a cliff, but Liberty rescues him, discovering her superpower is elasticity in the process. The pups retrieve the other crystals, subdue and rearrest Victoria, and destroy the meteor Magnet; however, Vance has already attracted more meteors, which are now heading for Adventure City. The pups give their crystals to Skye, who flies into the air and destroys each meteor individually. A giant meteor enters the Earth's atmosphere, and Skye destroys it as well; she is subsequently rendered unconscious, but the crystals resuscitate her. She and the Paw Patrol celebrate together, and resume protecting the city.",

King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi's newborn son, Simba, is presented to the gathering animals by Rafiki the mandrill, the kingdom's shaman and advisor. Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, covets the throne. Mufasa shows Simba the Pride Lands and forbids him from exploring beyond its borders. He explains to Simba the responsibilities of kingship and the \"circle of life\", which connects all living things. Scar manipulates Simba into exploring an elephant graveyard beyond the Pride Lands. There, Simba and his best friend, Nala, are chased by a clan of spotted hyenas led by the ruthless Shenzi. Mufasa is alerted by his majordomo, the hornbill Zazu, and rescues the cubs. Though disappointed with Simba for disobeying him and endangering himself and Nala, Mufasa forgives him. He explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba. Scar visits the hyenas and convinces them to help him kill Mufasa and Simba in exchange for hunting rights in the Pride Lands. Scar sets a trap for Simba and Mufasa. He lures Simba into a gorge and signals the hyenas to drive a large herd of wildebeest into a stampede to trample him. Scar alerts Mufasa, who saves Simba and tries to escape the gorge; he begs for Scar's help, but Scar betrays Mufasa by throwing him into the stampede to his death. Scar then deceives Simba into believing that Mufasa's death was his fault and tells him to leave the kingdom and never return. He then orders the hyenas to kill Simba, who escapes. Unaware of Simba's survival, Scar tells the pride that the stampede killed both Mufasa and Simba, and steps forward as the new king, allowing the hyenas into the Pride Lands. Simba collapses in a desert but is rescued by two outcasts, a meerkat and a warthog named Timon and Pumbaa. Simba grows up with his two new friends in their oasis, living a carefree life under their motto \"hakuna matata\" (\"no worries\" in Swahili). Meanwhile, Scar attempts to convince Sarabi to be his queen, but she refuses. Years later, an adult Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who is revealed to be Nala. Simba and Nala fall in love, and she urges him to return home, telling him that the Pride Lands have become drought-stricken under Scar's reign. Still feeling guilty over Mufasa's death, Simba refuses and leaves angrily. He encounters Rafiki, who tells Simba that Mufasa's spirit lives on in him. Simba is visited by the spirit of Mufasa in the night sky, who tells him that he must take his place as king. After Rafiki advises him to learn from the past instead of running from it, Simba decides to return to the Pride Lands. Aided by his friends, Simba sneaks past the hyenas at Pride Rock and confronts Scar, who shames Simba over his supposed role in Mufasa's death. Scar then reveals to Simba that he killed Mufasa. Enraged, Simba retaliates and forces Scar to confess the truth to the pride. A battle ensues between Simba and his allies and the hyenas. Scar attempts to escape, but is cornered by Simba at a ledge near the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and attempts to deceive Simba by blaming his actions on the hyenas. Simba spares Scar's life but orders him to leave the Pride Lands forever; Scar refuses and attacks Simba. Following a brief battle, Simba throws Scar off the ledge. Scar survives the fall, but the hyenas, who overheard him betraying them, attack and maul him to death. With Scar and the hyenas gone, Simba takes his place as king, and Nala becomes his queen. With the Pride Lands restored, Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the assembled animals, thus continuing the circle of life.",

Every summer, they are forced to give food to a gang of grasshoppers, led by Hopper. One day, Flik, a courageous but clumsy inventor ant, inadvertently destroys the food offering with his grain harvester. Hopper discovers this, and demands twice as much food as compensation. When Flik earnestly suggests the ants enlist the help of bigger bugs to fight the grasshoppers, Atta sees it as a way to get rid of Flik and sends him off. Flik travels to \"the city\", a heap of trash under a trailer. Flik mistakes a troupe of jobless Circus Bugs for the warrior bugs he seeks. The bugs, in turn, mistake Flik for a talent agent, and agree to travel with him back to Ant Island. During a welcome ceremony after their arrival, the Circus Bugs and Flik discover their mutual misunderstandings. The Circus Bugs attempt to leave, but are pursued by a nearby bird; while fleeing, they rescue Atta's younger sister Dot from the bird, gaining the ants' respect. At Flik's request, the Circus Bugs continue the ruse of being \"warriors\", thus enabling them to continue enjoying the ants' hospitality. Learning that Hopper fears birds inspires Flik to build a crewed ornithopter disguised as a bird to scare away the grasshoppers. Meanwhile, Hopper reminds his gang of the ants' superior numbers, warning them the ants will rebel if not kept in line. The ants finish constructing the fake bird. During the subsequent celebration, the Circus Bugs' old supervisor, P.T. Flea, arrives, seeking to rehire them and blowing their cover; the ants exile Flik and the Circus Bugs, and desperately try gathering food for a new offering. Hopper returns, sees the mediocre offering, and takes over the island. He then demands the ants' own winter food supply, planning to execute the Queen afterward. Overhearing the plan, Dot persuades Flik and the Circus Bugs to return to Ant Island. After the Circus Bugs distract the grasshoppers long enough to rescue the Queen, Flik deploys the bird. It initially fools the grasshoppers, but P.T., who is also fooled, sets the bird on fire. Realizing the deception, Hopper has Flik publicly beaten and proclaims the ants are lowly life forms who live only to serve the grasshoppers. Flik asserts Hopper actually fears the colony, because he has always known what they are capable of. This inspires the ants and the Circus Bugs to fight back against the grasshoppers, driving all but Hopper and his brother Molt away. The ants shove Hopper into the circus cannon to shoot him off of the island, but rain suddenly begins to fall. In the ensuing chaos, Hopper frees himself from the cannon and abducts Flik. The Circus Bugs and Atta pursue, with the latter catching up to Hopper and rescuing Flik, who lures Hopper to the real bird's nest. Believing the bird is another fake, Hopper taunts it, until it grabs him and feeds him to its chicks. With the anthill now at peace, Flik improves his inventions to help gather food for the ants. Flik and Atta become a couple, and proceed to send Hopper's affable brother Molt and a few ants to help P.T. and the Circus Bugs on their new tour. Atta and Dot become the new Queen and Princess. The ants celebrate their victory and congratulate Flik as a hero. They then bid a fond farewell to the circus troupe.",

The surgeons save Greg by transplanting his head onto Knight's body and rename him Dog Man. Dog Man inherits Knight's job and quickly becomes beloved for his repeated arrests of Petey, but Petey always escapes. Dog Man becomes lonely and depressed due to the loss of Knight and the abandonment of his girlfriend Alice, who sells their house. He takes a tennis ball he used to play with as his only memory of his former life and moves into a doghouse on the city outskirts.

Petey decides to abandon him in a cardboard box in the middle of the city, where Dog Man finds and decides to adopt him. The two begin to bond as they spend time together in Dog Man's home.

Grampa immediately starts berating Petey, revealing that he has not changed despite Li'l Petey's hopes. Flippy is resurrected at the Living Spray factory after being mishandled by the factory employees, which also causes the factory itself to come to life. Having been reprogrammed by Petey to destroy all good people, he targets Dog Man and his friends, who fight an army of buildings affected by the Living Spray. A remorseful Petey reluctantly decides to team up with Dog Man, swapping out Li'l Petey inside 80-HD with himself.

Yuta meets fellow students Maki Zen'in, Toge Inumaki, and Panda, all with distinct abilities of their own. During his first mission with Maki, Yuta successfully summons Rika on his own for the first time to save them from a Cursed Spirit. Three months pass in his school training, and he grows close to Maki, Toge, and Panda. One day, on a mission together, Toge and Yuta are attacked by a high-level Curse. The man behind the attack was Suguru Geto, a previous student and old friend of Gojo, who defected from the school and killed over a hundred innocent people on a mission. Geto attempts to get Yuta on his side so they can make use of Rika, but Yuta refuses when he insults Yuta's friends due to unsettled circumstances. Geto declares war to activate a portal to the under-world: he will release a thousand Curses upon the city to remove non-sorcerer humans, as he believes them to be undeserving and beneath sorcerers. Geto's real reason for the war, however, is to distract Gojo so he can kill Yuta and add Rika to his collection of cursed spirits. Gojo realizes this upon learning of Yuta's background, and sends Inumaki and Panda back to the school to protect Yuta and Maki during the night of Geto's attack. Geto overpowers them all, leaving only Yuta conscious. Enraged at seeing his friends hurt, Yuta promises himself as a sacrifice to Rika in order to strengthen their bond. As a result, Geto is severely wounded. He is found by Gojo, who after reflecting on their past friendship, executes him. Gojo confirms that Yuta was the one who inadvertently cursed Rika through un-specified ties to royal bloodlines within the hierarchy of Japan's caste system, rather than the other way around, by being unable to accept her death. Yuta broke the curse after promising himself to Rika, and she is able to pass on peacefully after Yuta continues training as a sorcerer within the institution. In a post-credits scene, Geto's former ally Miguel eats lunch with Yuta in Kenya, and Gojo comes to join them.",

    "plot": "After the events of the previous film, Peaches is engaged to marry a benign mammoth named Julian, but Manny disapproves of this as he finds Julian annoying and incapable of protecting her. The concern escalates when Peaches reveals her wish to travel and explore the world as their honeymoon, which both Manny and Ellie oppose. Diego and Shira want to have children but worry they will not make friends, as the other kids are scared of saber-tooth tigers. Sid is about to propose marriage to his girlfriend, Francine, but is dumped by her and laments his solitude. During Manny and Ellie's wedding anniversary, asteroids strike the place, and the herd barely escapes and takes shelter in a cave. Meanwhile, in the underground lost world, Buck returns a Chasmosaurus egg to its mother after it was stolen by a trio of flying dromaeosaurs named Gavin, Gertie, and Roger. Buck discovers an ancient stone pillar and takes it to the surface, where he reunites with the herd. Buck explains that according to the pillar, asteroids have caused two extinctions in the past, and with the next one incoming, he believes that the only place they could find a clue to stop it is on the site of the previous ones' impact: a nearby volcano, as according to its engravings, they always fall in the same place. However, the trio overhear their conversation, and Gavin and Gertie decide to stop them. They believe that they could easily avoid the impact due to their natural ability to fly, thus not only getting their revenge on Buck but also eradicating Earth's population and securing domination over the planet for the dinosaurs. Roger is reluctant, but Gavin and Gertie strong-arm him to cooperate. During the herd's journey to the crash site, Buck discovers that asteroids have electromagnetic properties. He theorizes that if a large number of smaller asteroids were gathered and launched into orbit, they could attract the main asteroid away from Earth. After facing several obstacles and the interference of the dromaeosaurs, the herd arrives at Geotopia, a community of immortal animals formed inside one of the asteroids that fell long ago. There, Sid meets Brooke, a ground sloth who instantly falls in love with him. Shangri Llama, the leader of Geotopia, refuses to cooperate with Buck's plan to use the city's crystals to stop the asteroid, as they are the key to the residents' longevity. Sid inadvertently destroys the entire city when he attempts to remove one of the crystals to present Brooke with, immediately aging the Geotopians to their real ages, much to Shangri Llama's annoyance. After Brooke convinces the other Geotopians that stopping the asteroid is more critical than their lost youth, they and the herd fill up a volcano with a gigantic ball made up of all the crystals so that the pressure launches them into space to draw the asteroid away. The dromaeosaurs attempt to intervene but soon discover they will not survive the asteroid's impact. Buck convinces them to help and tells them that the dinosaurs can live harmoniously with them. After a small meteor hits Gavin, they accidentally drop the last and biggest crystal. Still, Manny and Julian work together to throw it back into the volcano, causing Julian to earn Manny's approval. The volcano then erupts, sending the magnetic crystal shards to the sky, which sends the oncoming asteroid back into space, away from Earth. The herd then departs for home, including Sid, who parts ways with Brooke. Still, just after they leave, a small crystal shard falls inside a hot spring, giving it rejuvenating properties and making the Geotopians and Granny, who stayed behind with them, regain their youth. After the herd returns, Manny and Ellie reconcile with Peaches, encouraging her to chase her dreams. Peaches and Julian marry afterwards, while Diego and Shira become heroes to the kids, and a rejuvenated Brooke appears during the wedding ceremony to reunite with Sid, much to his delight. Scrat accidentally crashes onto Mars and unintentionally annihilates all life before returning to his ship and fleeing back to Earth.",

    "plot": "In Moose Lake, Minnesota, a crate containing an orphaned male Spix's macaw hatchling that was smuggled out of Brazil falls from a truck and is found by Linda Gunderson, who names him Blu. Fifteen years later, Blu is highly domesticated, but has never learned to fly. One day, ornithologist Túlio Monteiro invites Blu and Linda to Rio de Janeiro for Blu, the last known male of his species, to mate with the last known female. At Túlio's aviary in Rio, Blu meets his prospective mate, the fiercely independent Jewel, who longs to flee back into the wilderness. Later that night, while Linda and Túlio are at a restaurant, the macaws are captured by an orphaned boy named Fernando and a sulphur-crested cockatoo named Nigel, both of whom work for a gang of bird smugglers led by Marcel, who wants to leave the country to sell Blu and Jewel on the black market. While Fernando regrets his actions, Nigel tells the macaws of his disdain for \"pretty birds\" after he was replaced by a parakeet on a television series. Blu's familiarity with cages allows him and Jewel to escape, alerting Nigel and the smugglers to give chase. The macaws are forced to travel on foot; Marcel had legcuffs applied to the two of them. Fernando helps Linda and Túlio search for the macaws the next morning, while Blu and Jewel meet the toco toucan Rafael, whose bulldog friend Luiz will remove their cuffs. Rafael unsuccessfully tries teaching Blu to fly from the edge of a tall mountain with Jewel. They soon catch up with red-crested cardinal Pedro and his yellow canary friend Nico, both of whom Blu had met the day before. Elsewhere, Nigel coerces a horde of thieving marmosets led by Mauro to capture Blu and Jewel. To help Blu and Jewel get along better, Pedro, Nico, and Rafael take the macaws to a samba dance party, where they begin to fall in love. The marmosets arrive, and after a brief fight breaks out, the five escape on a tram. At the smugglers' hideout, Fernando, Linda, and Túlio discover the macaws are gone. Fernando gets Marcel's henchmen, Armando and Tipa, to reveal that they will use the Rio Carnival parade to smuggle the birds to the abandoned airport. Blu and the others meet Luiz, whose saliva allows Blu and Jewel to slip out of their cuffs. Once released, Jewel flies happily into the sky with the others while Blu leaves, assuming he would only hold Jewel and the others back. Nigel captures Jewel, prompting Blu, Rafael, Nico, and Pedro to rush to the parade to rescue her, only to also be captured. Elsewhere, Linda and Túlio pose as dancers in Spix's macaw costumes to access the parade. The smugglers escape and flee to their plane. Using a fire extinguisher, Blu breaks out of his cage and quickly frees Jewel and the other birds, but Nigel attacks the macaws and Jewel's wing is badly injured in the process. Blu activates the fire extinguisher, sending Nigel out of the open cargo door and into one of its engines. The smugglers escape the rapidly-descending plane while Jewel falls out of the open cargo hatch. Blu jumps after her, intent on not leaving her behind. After Jewel kisses Blu, he finally gains his flying abilities, and he carries her to Linda and Túlio. Now a couple, Linda and Túlio adopt Fernando and start a bird sanctuary and a bookstore branch in Rio. Blu and Jewel raise three hatchlings together and celebrate with their friends. Meanwhile, the featherless Nigel survives the plane crash and is ridiculed by Mauro, while the smugglers are jailed for their crimes.",

    "plot": "Manny, Sid, and Diego live in a valley that is surrounded by a high ice wall on all sides and is inhabited by many other creatures. The trio discovers that the ice wall is actually a dam that is barely holding a reservoir that could flood the valley if it fails. A vulture tells them that there is a boat at the other end of the valley that may save them, but they must reach it in three days. A chunk of ice breaks off from the top of the dam, initiating their immediate evacuation. Manny is also struggling with the thought of possibly being the last mammoth alive. Meanwhile, Cretaceous, a Metriorhynchus, and Maelstrom, a Globidens—both frozen since the Mesozoic era—escape due to melting ice and seek to eat all the mammals they can during the flood. On their journey to the boat, the trio meet Ellie, a mammoth who believes she is an opossum, and Crash and Eddie, two mischievous opossums whom Ellie believes to be her brothers. Sid invites them to join their journey to the boat, and Ellie accepts. After a dangerous encounter with Cretaceous and Maelstrom while crossing a pond, Ellie realizes that she is a mammoth. Manny begins to fall in love with her, but denies his feelings at first because he feels like he is replacing his deceased wife and child. Despite this bonding moment with Manny, she distances herself from him when he suggests \"saving their species\". Ellie and Manny later reconcile. The herd takes a break for the night. The next day, the group finds the boat behind a field of hot geysers. Manny, Sid, and Diego separate from Ellie, Crash, and Eddie when the two mammoths argue about which route is safest. Just as Manny, Sid, and Diego bypass the geysers, the ice dam fails, unleashing a flood upon the valley. Ellie, Crash, and Eddie, who took the safer yet longer way, are trapped inside a cave due to falling rocks. Crash and Eddie escape through a small hole and warn Manny, who rushes back to save Ellie. Cretaceous and Maelstorm ambush Manny underwater, but he tricks them into dislodging a boulder, thus freeing Ellie. Manny and Ellie reunite with the others atop a boulder, but the water is still rising. Meanwhile, Scrat, after a series of misadventures to get back his acorn, climbs the adjacent glacial wall beside them and inadvertently creates a long crack when he punctures the ice. The crack widens into a gigantic fissure which splits open the wall and drains the floodwaters, saving everyone; in the process, Scrat falls within the fissure and is washed away. A group of mammoths later appear from the fissure, proving to everyone that mammoths are not really extinct. Manny initially lets Ellie go with the mammoth herd, but after some encouragement from Sid and Diego to move on from his past, he catches up to her, expressing his desire to stay with her. Manny, Sid, Diego, Ellie, Crash, and Eddie then venture out of the valley. After falling into the fissure and nearly drowning, Scrat has a near death experience, entering a heaven full of acorns. Suddenly, he finds himself being \"sucked back\" just as he is about to reach a gigantic acorn. Scrat then discovers that he has been resuscitated by Sid. Scrat is enraged, believing that Sid stole his acorn, and proceeds to viciously attack him.",

    "plot": "In New York City, pianist Joe Gardner teaches music part-time at a middle school while dreaming of playing jazz professionally. When he receives an offer to teach full-time, his mother Libba urges him to accept, although Joe is resistant. Joe learns famous jazz musician Dorothea Williams has an opening in her quartet and auditions at a jazz club. Impressed with his piano playing, Dorothea hires him for that night's show. As Joe heads off, his excitement distracts him, and he dies falling down an open manhole. Joe finds himself a disembodied soul heading into an afterlife called the \"Great Beyond\". Unwilling to die, he tries to escape but ends up in the \"Great Before\" (aka \"You Seminar\"), a realm where new souls are prepared for life on Earth with guidance from otherworldly counselors — all named Jerry — and experienced souls who act as mentors. Each new soul has a badge that grants passage to Earth once it has been completely filled in with interests and personality traits. Mistaken for a mentor, Joe is assigned to 22, a stubborn soul who has been in the Great Before for thousands of years and hopes to avoid Earth. Intrigued by Joe's desperation to return to an unremarkable life, 22 agrees to let Joe help find her \"spark\", which will complete her badge and enable Joe to use it to return home. After Joe fails several attempts to find 22 a passion, they visit \"the Zone\", a place that souls enter when their passions create a euphoric trance, but which becomes a trap for obsessed, lost souls. They meet Moonwind, a sign twirler who regularly enters the Zone to rescue lost souls, who helps the duo locate Joe's soulless body in a hospital. Joe returns to Earth but accidentally brings 22 with him, and they awaken in Joe's hospital room in the wrong bodies, with 22 inhabiting Joe's body and Joe inhabiting the body of a therapy cat. They locate Moonwind, who agrees to meet at the jazz club that night to restore Joe to his body. In the meantime, 22 settles into Joe's body and starts to find enjoyment in trivial things like food, wind, and music. She holds poignant conversations with Libba, Joe's student Connie, and Joe's barber Dez, deepening her understanding of life. Meanwhile, Terry, the being in charge of counting souls, discovers the count is off and arrives on Earth to find Joe. As the day ends, Joe and 22 visit Moonwind to return Joe to his body, but 22, having finally discovered the joy of living, refuses to leave Joe's body and flees. As Joe chases her through a subway station, Terry disconnects them from life and returns them to the Great Before. 22 discovers her badge is complete, but Joe bitterly insists it was the result of experiencing life in his body with his preferences and that she has no purpose of her own. Distraught, 22 throws the badge at him and retreats into the Zone. A Jerry informs Joe that a spark is not a souls purpose in life, but rather a souls desire to live. However, Joe refuses to believe this and discreetly uses 22's badge to return to Earth. The show at the jazz club is successful, but Joe is confused when it does not bring the fulfillment he was expecting. Looking at small objects that 22 collected while occupying his body, he recalls the moments they had enjoyed together and realizes these experiences gave 22 her spark. Joe plays piano and enters the Zone to return 22's badge but discovers she has become a lost soul, obsessed with the idea that she has no purpose. Joe chases her down and shows her a helicopter leaf she collected to remind her of her time on Earth. They realize that a spark is not a soul's purpose, but simply a desire to live. Joe's actions restore 22 to normal; he returns her badge and accompanies her for as long as he can on her journey down to Earth. As Joe prepares to enter the Great Beyond, a Jerry stops him and offers him another chance at life in thanks for finally inspiring 22 to live (while another Jerry distracts Terry to manipulate the count). The next morning, Joe returns to his body on Earth, committed to fully living life.",

Though he knows the Man in the Moon played a part in his transformation, the moon does not provide any answers as to why he has been turned into \"Jack Frost\". Three centuries later, the Man in the Moon alerts Nicholas St. North to the return of Pitch Black, who threatens to plague children with nightmares. North rallies his fellow Guardians, E. Aster Bunnymund, Sanderson Mansnoozie, and Toothiana, and they discover that Jack has been chosen to join their ranks. Jack gets kidnapped by Bunny and transported to the North Pole, where he learns from North that every Guardian has a \"center\", something they foster in children. Jack knows nothing of his center and resists the call to become a Guardian. Meanwhile, North gets a message from Toothiana that her palace is under attack. The Guardians and Jack Frost manage to chase away Pitch, but not before Pitch kidnaps Tooth's subordinate fairies and steals all of the teeth, weakening children's belief in Tooth. Jack learns that every baby tooth holds the childhood memories of its owner, and may help him find out more about his past, motivating him to help Toothiana. To counter Pitch's plan, the other Guardians and Jack embark on a mission to collect teeth from children themselves. In their quest, they visit Jamie Bennett, a young boy who, still clinging to his belief, sees all of them except for Jack. On their way back to the North Pole, Pitch's Nightmares attack the Guardians and Sandy is killed. With Easter approaching, the Guardians travel to Bunny's Warren and assist in the egg-coloring preparations. An unknown voice lures Jack to Pitch's lair, where he finds his teeth. Pitch distracts Jack long enough for the Nightmares to destroy all the eggs, causing children to stop believing in Bunny. Jack flees to Antarctica, where Pitch, after attempting to persuade Jack to join him, breaks his magic staff and throws him into a chasm. Unlocking the memories within his teeth, Jack learns that he was once a human who sacrificed himself to save his younger sister. Inspired, he repairs his staff and rescues the kidnapped fairies. Thanks to Pitch, every child in the world has stopped believing except Jamie, drastically weakening the Guardians. Finding Jamie's belief wavering, Jack makes it snow in his bedroom, restoring his faith in the Guardians and making Jamie the first person to believe in him. Jack realizes that his center is fun and uses it to gather Jamie's friends, play, and diminish their fear, which bolsters the Guardians and resurrects Sandy. The children's dreams prove stronger than the Nightmares, who turn on Pitch and drag him to the underworld. Jack finally accepts his place as the Guardian of Fun.",

When she is a child, her father remarries Lady Tremaine, a widow with two daughters of her own, Anastasia and Drizella, but dies shortly after. Jealous of Cinderella's charm and beauty, Lady Tremaine and her daughters abuse her and eventually force her to become a scullion in her own château. As the years pass, Cinderella remains kind and gentle, obediently doing her chores. She also makes friends with the mice and birds that live in the château, and takes care of them, while protecting them from her stepmother's pet cat, Lucifer. One day, the King invites all the eligible maidens in the kingdom to a royal ball, hoping that his son, the Prince, will choose one of them as a bride. Wanting to attend, Cinderella finds a dress of her late birth mother's to fix up. Fearing she will upstage them at the ball, Lady Tremaine and the stepsisters deliberately keep her busy with no time to spare. Jaq, Gus, and the other animals decide to fix up the dress for Cinderella, using beads and a sash discarded by the stepsisters. However, when Cinderella attempts to go to the ball with her family, the stepsisters are upset when they recognize their belongings and angrily tear the dress apart, before leaving Cinderella behind. A distraught Cinderella runs out to the garden in tears, where she is met by her fairy godmother, who has come to help. She transforms a pumpkin into a carriage; Jaq, Gus, and two other mice into horses; Cinderella's old horse Major into a coachman; and her bloodhound Bruno into a footman. The fairy godmother also bestows Cinderella a shimmering silver ball gown and glass slippers, but she warns her that all the magic will end on the stroke of midnight. Cinderella arrives at the ball, unrecognized by the stepsisters, although Lady Tremaine believes something is familiar about her. The prince is instantly smitten, so the King orders the Grand Duke to make sure the romance goes without a hitch. The duke prevents anyone from interfering as Cinderella and the Prince dance a waltz and wander out to the palace grounds, falling deeper in love. However, when Cinderella hears the clock tolling midnight, she runs away before she and the Prince can exchange names. Despite the efforts of the Grand Duke, Cinderella flees the palace, losing one of her glass slippers on the staircase. The palace guards pursue, but when the magic ends on the stroke of 12, Cinderella and the animals revert to their former appearances and hide in the woods. Cinderella discovers the other glass slipper is still on her foot, and takes it home with her. The Prince promises he will marry none but the girl who fits the glass slipper. The King orders the Grand Duke to try the shoe on every girl in the kingdom until he finds a match. When the news reaches the château, Cinderella is shocked to realize it was the Prince she met. Hearing Cinderella humming the waltz from the ball, Lady Tremaine realizes the truth and locks Cinderella in her attic bedroom. While the stepsisters unsuccessfully try on the slipper, Jaq and Gus steal the key back from Lady Tremaine and take it to Cinderella. Lucifer attempts to stop them, but the birds summon Bruno who scares him out of the house, and a freed Cinderella hurries to meet the Grand Duke. In a last effort to prevent Cinderella from overshadowing her daughters, Lady Tremaine deliberately causes the Grand Duke's footman to trip and break the glass slipper. Cinderella reveals she has the other slipper, much to Lady Tremaine's shock, which the Grand Duke places on her foot. Cinderella and the Prince are married, and share a kiss as they set off in a carriage and leave for their honeymoon.",

    "plot": "Under the Atlantic Ocean, in the kingdom of Atlantica, Ariel, a mermaid is fascinated by the human world and collects human artifacts in her grotto. With her best friend Flounder, they both visit Scuttle, a seagull who gives inaccurate information about humans. However, her father King Triton, the ruler of Atlantica, says contact between merpeople and humans is forbidden. One night, Ariel, Flounder, and Sebastian, a crab who serves as Triton's adviser and court composer, travel to the surface to watch a birthday celebration for Prince Eric. Ariel falls in love with Eric at first sight. A storm wrecks the ship and knocks Eric overboard. Ariel rescues Eric and brings him to shore. She sings to him, but leaves just as he regains consciousness to avoid being discovered. Discovering a change in Ariel's behavior, Triton questions Sebastian and learns of her love for Eric. Outraged, Triton travels to Ariel's grotto and destroys her collection of artifacts in a misguided attempt to protect her, causing Ariel to break down in tears. After a remorseful Triton leaves, Ariel is approached by two eels named Flotsam and Jetsam, who take her to Ursula the sea witch. Ursula makes a deal with Ariel to transform her into a human for three days in exchange for Ariel's voice, which Ursula puts in a nautilus shell. If Ariel receives a \"true love's kiss\" within these three days, she will remain a human permanently. Otherwise, she will turn back into a mermaid and become Ursula's property. After accepting, Ariel is given human legs and taken to the surface by Flounder and Sebastian. Eric finds Ariel on the beach and takes her to his castle, unaware that she is the one who rescued him earlier. Ariel spends time with Eric, and at the end of the second day, they almost kiss but are thwarted by Flotsam and Jetsam. Furious at Ariel's close success, Ursula disguises herself as a young woman named Vanessa and uses Ariel's voice to cast a hypnotic enchantment on Eric that makes him forget about Ariel. The next day, Ariel discovers that Eric will be married to Vanessa. Scuttle discovers Vanessa's true identity and informs Ariel, who pursues the wedding barge. Sebastian informs Triton, and Scuttle disrupts the wedding with the help of various sea animals. In the chaos, Ursula's shell is destroyed, restoring Ariel's voice and breaking the enchantment over Eric. Realizing that Ariel is the girl who saved his life, Eric rushes to kiss her, but the sun sets and Ariel transforms back into a mermaid. Turning back into her true form, Ursula kidnaps Ariel. Triton confronts Ursula and demands Ariel's release, but the deal is inviolable. At Ursula's urging, Triton agrees to take Ariel's place as Ursula's prisoner, giving up his trident. Ariel is released as Triton transforms into a polyp and loses his authority over Atlantica. With her true goal complete, Ursula declares herself the Queen of the Seven Seas, and claims Triton's trident when Eric appears with a harpoon. Ursula attempts to kill Eric, but Ariel intervenes, causing Ursula to inadvertently kill Flotsam and Jetsam. Enraged, Ursula uses the trident to grow in size. Ariel and Eric reunite on the surface just before a gigantic Ursula separates them. She then gains full control of the ocean, creating a storm and bringing sunken ships to the surface. Just as Ariel is about to be killed, Eric commandeers a wrecked ship and impales Ursula with its splintered bowsprit. With Ursula dead, Triton and the other polyps in her garden revert to their original forms. Realizing that Ariel truly loves Eric, Triton turns her into a human and approves her marriage to Eric. Ariel and Eric marry on a ship and depart, with all of Ariel's friends and family watching them as well.",

Tim's younger brother Ted is a successful CEO and is always absent. One night, Tim discovers that Tina comes from Baby Corp, just as how Ted did, and that she has been assigned for a \"special mission\" that requires Ted's presence. Tim refuses to call Ted, saying that he will never come, until Tina leaves a fake voicemail for Ted, luring him to the Templetons' house. The next morning, Ted arrives and Tim explains to him that Tina is a Baby Corp dispatch. Tina introduces the brothers to a new formula that will allow them to turn back into children for 48 hours in order to infiltrate Tabitha's school and figure out what Dr. Erwin Armstrong, founder and principal of the Acorn Center for Advanced Childhood, is planning behind parents' backs. At the school, Tim, now as his seven-year-old self, follows Tabitha to her class while baby Ted is placed with other babies. Ted rallies the babies to help him leave the playroom so that he can go to Armstrong's office to investigate. Tim tries to be sent to the principal's office by disrupting class, but is instead put in \"The Box\" for timeout. Ted discovers that Armstrong is actually a baby himself with his robot suit, having run away from home after realizing that he was smarter than his parents and now makes money by creating popular phone apps. His ultimate plan is to eliminate every parent on B-Day, so that they cannot tell their children what to do anymore. On the night of a holiday pageant, where Tabitha is supposed to sing a solo, the brothers and Tina plan to expose Armstrong.

    "plot": "Some time after the events of A Fashion Fairytale, Barbie is at the premiere of her latest movie along with her actor boyfriend Ken, when her rival and co-star, Raquelle, steps on her dress, ripping it. Her stylists, Carrie and Taylor, who are secretly fairies, use magic to mend it. Crystal, a photographer, greets Carrie and Taylor and, taking one last picture of Ken, leaves to go back to Gloss Angeles, a realm with fairies and winged creatures. Crystal shows Princess Graciella the pictures she took at the premiere. She gives the Princess some tea in which she secretly mixed with a love potion. Crystal then shows the Princess the picture of Ken she took, and Graciella falls in love with him almost instantly. The next day at Wally's restaurant, Barbie confronts Raquelle about the dress-stepping incident. During the facade, Princess Graciella, Crystal, and two assistant fairies unexpectedly show up and kidnap Ken. Carrie and Taylor sprout their wings and attempt to stop the Princess from taking Ken, but the portal to Gloss Angeles closes before they can enter it. The stylists attempt to dissuade Raquelle and Barbie of the fact that they just saw fairies but finally admit their existence. They explain that Ken is in trouble because if a human marries a fairy, the human has to stay in Gloss Angeles forever. Meanwhile, in Gloss Angeles, Ken and the Princess arrive in the royal palace, where they meet Zane, Graciella's boyfriend. Zane is outraged at Graciella's new love interest and challenges Ken to three consecutive duels. Barbie, Raquelle, and the fairies go to a clothing store, where they enter a Fairy Flyway (a fairy method of transport), which leads them to the top of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The fairies reveal that Lilianna Roxelle, a world-famous fashion critic, is the oldest and wisest fairy living on Earth. After they arrive at Lilianna's home, she informs them that Princess Graciella is under a love potion spell. She gives Barbie an antidote that will turn the Princess back to normal if it rains down on her. It is also revealed that Taylor and Carrie were banished from Gloss Angeles earlier due to some personal reasons. The girls then take Liliana's portal to continue their journey. Barbie, Raquelle, Taylor, and Carrie make it to Gloss Angeles and they make a stop at Wings and Things in order to get fake wings for Barbie and Raquelle where they run into the human owner named Reena and her fairy husband Graylon. They then disguise themselves as cooks to try to reveal Princess Graciella about Crystal's love potion; however, Crystal reveals Taylor and Carrie by recognizing Taylor's shoes, and the princess locks the four in furyspheres. Barbie and Raquelle talk and finally figure out their misunderstanding. The reason Raquelle has always been so mean to Barbie is that she never got the chance to be Barbie's friend. They apologize to each other and become friends. Their reconciliation breaks the furyspheres and their wings become real, and they now realize that forgiveness lets them fly. The two then go to stop the wedding between Graciella and Ken, holding off the attendants and the princess. Finally, Barbie pours the antidote over Graciella, curing her of the love potion. Graciella realizes that it was Crystal who gave her the love potion and apologizes for the misunderstanding. She also explains that the reason she banished Taylor and Carrie is that the three of them were once friends but Taylor and Carrie started spending so much time together that she felt left out and betrayed. At the urging of Barbie and Raquelle, she lifts Taylor and Carrie's ban, and the three fairies forgive each other. Graciella then punishes Crystal by having her clean up after the ceremony and goes to marry Zane. After the wedding, Graciella tells Barbie and Raquelle that their wings will disappear when they and Ken go back to the human world and then reappear when they return to Gloss Angeles. She also tells them that their memories of their adventures here will be erased since Raquelle cannot keep a secret. Graciella sends them back to Earth with magical dust. The next morning, Barbie wakes up with no recollection of Gloss Angeles or the fairies, thinking it was a dream. However, she and Raquelle are now friends. Back at Wally's, Carrie and Taylor tell the two and Ken that they reconnected with an old friend (Princess Graciella) and are going back to their hometown (Gloss Angeles). In the last scene, Carrie and Taylor turn into fairies out of sight, and fly back through the portal.",

    "plot": "Suzume Iwato is a high-school girl living with her aunt Tamaki in a town in Kyushu. She has recurring dreams of her childhood self walking through a ruined cityscape at night, before running into a shadowy figure resembling her late mother. On her way to school one morning, Suzume meets a young man searching for abandoned locations with doors, and tells him of a nearby abandoned onsen resort. Following him there, Suzume discovers a free-standing door, which she opens to find a starlit field that she cannot enter. She trips over a cat statue on the floor, which turns into a real cat and flees. Frightened, Suzume rushes to school. During lunch, Suzume notices a huge column of smoke from the location of the abandoned resort, which no one else can see. She returns there and finds the man from earlier struggling to close the door through which the smoke is escaping. Suzume helps him lock the door with an old key. The smoke disappears, but not before causing earthquake damage to the town. Suzume takes the injured man, Souta Munakata, to her home. He explains that he is a \"Closer\" and must locate and lock specific doors in abandoned places throughout Japan to prevent a supernatural \"worm\" from being released and causing earthquakes. As they talk, the cat from the resort appears and turns Souta into the chair he was sitting on. Souta, now an animated three-legged chair, chases the cat onto a ferry headed for Ehime, with Suzume following. Souta tells Suzume that the cat is a \"keystone\", and that the worm was released after the keystone's removal from the resort door. Upon reaching Ehime, Suzume and Souta find social media posts from locals, who have photographed and named the cat \"Daijin\". They locate the worm again and close the door it is escaping from in an abandoned school. Suzume and Souta hitch a ride to Kobe, and Daijin leads them to an abandoned amusement park, where they stop the worm from emerging again through a Ferris wheel gondola. Souta explains that the portal within the doors leads to the Ever-After, where souls go after death. After tracking Daijin to Tokyo, Souta asks Suzume to take them to his apartment. He explains the legend of the worm, and that he is the last descendant of a family that, for generations, had been responsible for locking doors which lead to the Ever-After. Souta speaks of two keystones that seal the worm: the western keystone has become Daijin, while the location of the eastern keystone is unknown. He warns that if the worm tries to emerge in Tokyo, it could cause damage similar to the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. Suzume notices the worm emerging again, and the two head towards it. Daijin reappears and reveals that he has passed on his function as keystone to Souta. Souta suddenly turns into the new keystone and Suzume reluctantly uses him to seal the worm. Awakening at a shrine housing the Tokyo gate, Suzume sees Souta within the Ever-After but is unable to enter. Suzume visits Souta's grandfather Hitsujirō at the hospital, hoping to discover how to rescue Souta. Hitsujirō explains that Suzume's ability to see the worm and the Ever-After through the doors means that at some point in her life she entered the realm through one such door. Moreover, the doorway she first used is the only place where she can re-enter the Ever-After. Suzume runs into Souta's friend Tomoya Serizawa, who is looking for him, and Tamaki, who wants to take her back home to Kyushu. She instead convinces Tomoya to drive her and Tamaki to her childhood hometown in Tōhoku, which was destroyed in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that also killed her mother. Suzume believes she will find her door there. At a rest stop along the way, Suzume and Tamaki get into an argument, and she discovers that her aunt is possessed by Sadaijin, the eastern keystone, who now accompanies them. They reach the ruins of Suzume's old house, where Suzume finds the door and enters it with Daijin and Sadaijin. Inside the Ever-After, Sadaijin distracts the worm, while Suzume awakens Souta, who regains his human form. Realizing the consequences of his freedom, Daijin reverts himself to being the western keystone. Suzume and Souta use him and Sadaijin to imprison the worm again in the Ever-After. Afterwards, Suzume sees a young girl in the Ever-After with them. She realizes the young girl is herself, from 12 years ago, and that the younger girl mistook her older self to be her mother. Suzume gives her young self the chair that had been Souta's body, built by her mother as a childhood birthday present. The young Suzume leaves the Ever-After 12 years in the past, to be taken in by Tamaki. Souta and Suzume also leave the Ever-After in the present. Souta returns to Tokyo and Suzume and Tamaki return to Kyushu. The next year, while on her way to school, Suzume unexpectedly encounters Souta again, at the same location where they first met.",

    "plot": "Éowyn narrates the story of Héra, a would-be shieldmaiden of Rohan and the daughter of King Helm Hammerhand who lived around 200 years before Bilbo Baggins finds the One Ring. Freca, a Dunlending lord, comes to King Helm's hall with his son Wulf, Héra's childhood friend. Freca is upset that Héra is to be married to a lord of Gondor and tries to force marriage between Wulf and Héra, in order to usurp Rohan's throne. Wulf wishes to marry Héra, but she is uninterested in marrying anyone. Helm and Freca begin a fist-fight outside the hall, during which Helm unintentionally kills Freca with a single blow, earning him the nickname \"Hammerhand\". Wulf, devastated, vows revenge, leaves and is not heard of for years. One day, Héra and her part-Dunlending cousin Fréaláf encounter a dead Southron warrior, a tamer of mûmakil. The warrior's mûmak, rabid, appears and attacks; Héra disposes of it by luring it to a forest lake where it is eaten by a Watcher in the Water. Targg, one of Freca's generals, follows and kidnaps her. She is taken to Wulf's stronghold at Isengard and discovers that Wulf has become High Lord of the Dunlendings, a host of hill-tribe rebels. She offers to marry Wulf to stop his attack on Rohan, but she is rescued by Fréaláf and her aunt Olwyn. Wulf invades Rohan. Helm thinks Fréaláf a coward for wishing to evacuate Edoras to Dunharrow fortress, and casts him out. Helm prepares for battle after Lord Thorne promises to raise men, but Héra discovers that Thorne is a traitor; he tries to kill her, but Héra and her horse kill him. As battle ensues, Héra evacuates Edoras to the Hornburg upon realizing her father has been betrayed and his army is outnumbered. Wulf kills Helm's son Haleth in battle, then captures Haleth's brother Hama and murders him in front of Helm, who offered to die in his place. Wulf begins a siege of the Hornburg which lasts the winter, and builds an enormous siege-tower. Helm, wounded and grief-stricken, sneaks out at night by a secret passage to kill Wulf's forces using only his fists. While searching for Helm during one of his night raids, and helping him kill a troll, Héra chances upon two orcs from Mordor who are taking rings from the dead, as instructed by their master. Helm leads Héra back to the Hornburg's gates. When Wulf and his forces pursue them, Helm remains behind to cover Héra's escape and dies fighting, frozen standing up, knees unbent. Héra sends an eagle bearing Helm's armor to Fréaláf for help and, dressed in a beautiful old bridal dress, rides onto the siege-tower bridge that Wulf has just lowered to invade the Hornburg, and challenges him to combat, to distract him and his army from the Rohirrim escaping via the secret passage. She defeats Wulf and demands his surrender. Targg, who had counselled Wulf to call off the siege, agrees with her, but Wulf murders him. Fréaláf arrives with his men and uses Helm's horn and armor to scare the Dunlendings into believing Helm has returned from the grave, sending them fleeing. Wulf attacks Héra, but she chokes him to death with a shield, ending the war. Helm goes on to be the namesake for the valley of the Hornburg and its stronghold. Saruman the White is the new keeper of Isengard and offers friendship to Fréaláf, the new king. Héra, uninterested in ruling, goes off with Olwyn to seek adventure; her first is meeting Gandalf, who has questions about the orcs she saw hunting for rings. Éowyn concludes that Héra remained wild and free until the end of her days.",

    "title": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem",
    "plot": "Techno Cosmic Research Institute (TCRI) executive Cynthia Utrom sends a squad to hunt down rogue scientist Baxter Stockman, who has created a mutagenic ooze with which he intends to form his own mutant animal family, starting with a housefly. Baxter is interrupted by Cynthia's strike force and killed in the resulting explosion, while the mutagen falls into the sewers of New York City. The mutagen turns four turtle brothers—Michelangelo, Leonardo, Raphael and Donatello—and a rat named Splinter into humanoid mutants, whereupon Splinter adopts the turtles. Splinter distrusts humanity—particularly after one encounter where he and the turtles were chased away—and trains his sons in the art of ninjutsu, instructing them to only leave their sewer home to steal supplies. Over the years, the Turtles long to live with and like humans their age, much to Splinter's dismay. Fifteen years later, the Turtles defeat a gang of criminals to recover a stolen moped belonging to a teenager named April O'Neil, revealing themselves and their origins. April, an aspiring journalist, has been investigating a series of robberies of TCRI technology by a criminal known as \"Superfly\". The Turtles plan to stop Superfly and, through April's reporting, win public acceptance as heroes. They intercept a piece of stolen technology and meet Superfly under the Brooklyn Bridge, discovering that he is not only a mutant himself, but leader of a mutant gang. Ecstatic to meet fellow mutants, the Turtles bond with Superfly and the others and he reveals their creation at the hands of Stockman, explaining that they evaded TCRI and are living on an abandoned ship in Staten Island. He then reveals that he plans to use the stolen technology to mutate every animal on Earth and create a world where mutants have dominance over humans. The Turtles try to intervene, but the gang escapes with the equipment while a tracker TCRI installed on the equipment falls back with the Turtles, allowing them to be captured. At TCRI headquarters, Cynthia extracts the Turtles' mutagen, but April arrives with Splinter to rescue them. At the gang's hideout, Splinter and the Turtles convince them that their plan for domination will make them no better than the worst of humanity, and together they turn on Superfly, destroying his machine. However, the ooze falls into the water, combining marine wildlife with Superfly, who then transforms into a gigantic whale-like kaiju after grabbing animals from a nearby zoo. He attacks the city and the Turtles and other mutants attempt to stop him but are assumed by the public to be fellow monsters. Leonardo finds his voice as a leader while April overcomes her anxiety and commandeers a news broadcast to explain the mutants' good intentions and the citizens of New York come to their aid. With the help of the citizens and other mutants, the Turtles drop a canister of TCRI retro-mutagen into Superfly's blowhole, turning him back into a collection of normal animals. Reconciling with Splinter, the Turtles, April, and the mutants are celebrated by the city. The Turtles enroll at April's high school, where they are embraced as heroes. While the Turtles and April enjoy themselves at prom, they are under surveillance from Cynthia (holding the now unmutated Superfly captive), who plans to recapture the Turtles by enlisting the aid of the mysterious Shredder.",

Her mother insists that she take her mother's old, reliable broomstick. Kiki flies off into the cloudless night when the moon is full, searching for a new town for settlement. She encounters another witch and her cat who she finds pretentious but they cause Kiki to wonder what her special \"skill\" is. Kiki finds the town of Koriko and accidentally flies through traffic, causing disruptions. She is approached by a policeman, but a boy named Tombo helps her escape. Kiki looks for a place to live and work in her new town. She finds the Gutiokipanja bakery, owned by Osono and her husband, Fukuo, who are expecting a child. Osono invites her to live in a room above the bakery. Kiki opens a business delivering goods by broomstick, known as the \"Witch Delivery Service\". Her first delivery is of a small stuffed toy of a black cat that looks like Jiji, as a birthday gift for Osono's neighbour's nephew Ket. Along the way, she is caught in the wind and ends up in a forest filled with crows, which attack her, causing her to lose the toy. They come up with a plan in which Jiji pretends to be the toy for Ket until Kiki can retrieve the real one. She finds it in the home of a young painter with crows, Ursula, who repairs and returns it. With the help of Ket's dog Jeff, Kiki successfully retrieves Jiji and replaces him with the stuffed cat. The next day, Tombo gives her an invitation to visit his aviation club. However, she gets busy with her deliveries, and gets caught in a thunderstorm on her way back. Drenched from the rain, she decides not to go. She then falls ill, but Osono cares for her until she recovers. Osono secretly arranges for Kiki to see Tombo again by assigning her a delivery addressed to him. Kiki apologizes for missing the party, and Tombo takes her for a test ride on the flying machine he is working on, fashioned from a bicycle. Kiki warms up to him, but is once again disgusted by Tombo's friends. Kiki becomes depressed and discovers she can no longer understand Jiji. She has also lost her flying ability and is forced to suspend her delivery business. Ursula then visits Kiki and asks if she can go to her house. She agrees, and the two spend time together there. Ursula determines that Kiki's crisis is a form of artist's block, and then suggests to her to find a new purpose, so that she can regain her powers. While visiting a former customer's house she witnesses an airship accident on television. Tombo is seen trying to help tie the dirigible to the ground, but a gust of wind pushes the aircraft away with him clinging to the rope. Kiki rushes to the scene and asks to borrow a broom from a local shop-owner. She regains her flying power and manages to rescue Tombo. With her confidence restored, she resumes her delivery service, and writes a letter home saying that she and Jiji are happy.",

A year after the wedding, Mavis reveals to Drac that she is pregnant and later gives birth to a baby boy whom the couple name Dennis, nicknamed “Denisovich” by Dracula. As Dennis's fifth birthday nears, he has yet to grow his fangs and Drac worries that his grandson might not gain vampire powers. Noticing the potential dangers her son might face living in Transylvania, Mavis starts to consider moving to Johnny's hometown in Santa Cruz, California in order to give Dennis a more “normal” childhood, much to Drac's disapproval. Drac tells Johnny, who does not want to leave the hotel either, to bring Mavis to California to visit his parents, Mike and Linda, but to make sure to keep her distracted so that she will not move, leaving Drac to \"babysit\" Dennis. Convinced that Dennis is a \"late fanger\", Drac enlists his friends Frank, Wayne, Griffin, Murray, and Blobby to help train Dennis to become a monster, but every attempt that some of them try fails. Drac and the gang then go to Camp Winnepacaca, Drac's childhood summer camp, only to sneak away after Drac finds out that the camp has become much safer and child-friendly. Drac attempts to hurl Dennis from a tall, unstable tower to pressure the boy's transformation into a bat, but he fails to transform and Drac flies down and rescues him at the last second. Afterwards, Frank ends up loosening the tower and it collapses onto the campfire setting both the tower and a screaming Frank on fire as he runs through all the buildings, setting the entire camp on fire. Meanwhile, in California, Mavis enjoys exploring the more human world. When the couple arrive at Mike and Linda's house, Linda unsuccessfully attempts to make Mavis feel more comfortable by covering her room with spooky, Halloween decorations and inviting other monster/human couples over. Feeling like a stranger, Mavis retreats up to the roof, and Johnny tells her that if they stay together, Dennis will live normally, persuading her to stay at the hotel. However, Johnny then discovers a video of Dennis falling that was filmed by the campers, and he and a furious Mavis go back to Transylvania, with Drac and his friends reaching the hotel at the same time. Mavis confronts her father for putting Dennis in grave danger and failing to letting humans into his heart, by showing him a pop remix video the campers made of Dennis's fall from the tower and Drac arguing with the staff. Mavis says that they will move out of the hotel after Dennis's birthday party. The night before the party, Drac hosts Johnny's family, and finds out that Mavis invited his father Vlad. As Vlad is more hateful of humans than he was, Drac tells Johnny to have his family disguise themselves as monsters. The next day, Vlad arrives with his monstrous bat-like servant Bela, and meets Dennis for the first time. Believing that fear will cause Dennis' fangs to sprout, Vlad possesses a stage performer, named Brandon, dressed as Dennis' favorite TV monster Kakie to scare him, but Drac shields his frightened grandson at the last moment, breaking Vlad's hold over the performer. Mavis mistakenly believes that Drac was responsible for the ruse, and while the family argues about whether or not Dennis can be happy in California, a guilt-ridden Dennis flees the hotel and enters the forest with Wayne and Wanda's daughter Winnie, whom he has a mutual crush on, in tow. Irritated with Vlad, Johnny and his family expose themselves, and an irate Vlad reprimands Drac for accepting humans before Drac rightfully tells off Vlad for not accepting Dennis as family just for being half human. Upon hearing that Dennis is a human, Bela attacks him and Winnie in their treehouse and abducts them. When Bela injures Winnie and threatens to destroy the hotel, Dennis's anger causes him to instantly grow his fangs and develop his vampire abilities, and he bashes up Bela. A furious Bela calls his giant-bat minions, but Drac, Johnny, Mavis, Dennis, and the rest of the monsters team up to defeat Bela's minions and drive them away, while Bela is shrunk by Vlad after making an attempt to kill Johnny. Vlad has been won over by Drac's claim that humans now coexist peacefully. With Dennis finally embracing his vampire abilities, Johnny and Mavis decide to continue raising him in Transylvania, and they resume the party with his friends and family.",

Frustrated that her decision does not fit his exact specifications of evil, he burns the place down. Fed up with Plankton never listening to her ideas, Karen removes her Empathy chip from her circuitry, transforms into a larger mech form, and magnetizes the Chum Bucket so that she can build a giant floating fortress and take over the world without him. Concerned, Plankton enlists the help of SpongeBob, who uses his hypnotism gear in order to get Plankton to be on the same page as Karen. Through flashbacks, it is revealed that Karen's original form was a calculator connected to a potato in a petri dish Plankton made during his childhood. Plankton later upgraded her to her current body at Bikini State University, where they built a freeze ray to put into motion plans to take over the world. Their original attempt at world domination was thwarted by a human child at the beach, who threw them back into the water, and it is revealed that overhearing Mr. Krabs jokingly say that the Krabby Patty secret formula is what will help him take over the world is what led Plankton to make his life's goal to steal the recipe.

    "plot": "In 1910, mother cat Duchess and her three kittens, Berlioz, Marie, and Toulouse, live in Paris, France with retired opera diva Madame Adelaide Bonfamille, and her English butler, Edgar. The cats are pampered pets that live a luxurious lifestyle and are very cultured in art and music, like their owner. While preparing her will with elderly lawyer Georges Hautecourt, Madame declares that her vast fortune will be first left to her cats, then revert to Edgar once they all pass away. Edgar overhears this through a speaking tube and, after erroneously calculating that he will die before he can claim his inheritance, plots to eliminate the cats. He sedates them by putting sleeping pills in a dish of cream, then drives them on his motorcycle out to the countryside in a basket. There, he is ambushed by two hounds named Napoleon and Lafayette, losing his hat, sidecar, umbrella, shoes, and the basket before escaping. The cats are left stranded in the countryside, while Madame Adelaide, Roquefort the mouse, and Frou-Frou the horse discover their absence. The next morning, Duchess meets a feral cat named Thomas O'Malley, who offers to guide her and the kittens to Paris. The group briefly hitchhikes in a milk truck before being chased out by the driver. Later, while crossing a railroad trestle, the cats narrowly avoid an oncoming train, and Marie falls into a river. O'Malley immediately dives in and rescues her, and is himself rescued by Amelia and Abigail Gabble, two English geese on holiday. The geese lead the cats to the outskirts of Paris, then depart to reunite with their inebriated Uncle Waldo. Meanwhile, Edgar returns to the countryside to retrieve his possessions (the only evidence that can incriminate him) from Napoleon and Lafayette and, after some difficulty, ultimately succeeds. Traveling across the rooftops of the city, the cats meet up with O'Malley's friend Scat Cat who performs the song \"Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat\" with several other cat musicians. After the band has departed, O'Malley and Duchess converse on a nearby rooftop while the kittens listen at a windowsill. Duchess' loyalty to Madame prompts her to decline O'Malley's marriage proposal. The next day, Duchess and the kittens return to Madame's mansion. Edgar finds them before Madame does, and places them in a sack, deciding to ship them to Timbuktu. Roquefort catches up with O'Malley at Duchess' instruction, and O'Malley returns to the mansion, sending Roquefort to find Scat Cat and his gang. Though he struggles to explain the situation to the alley cats, Roquefort successfully brings them to O'Malley's aid. O'Malley, the alley cats, and Frou-Frou fight Edgar, while Roquefort frees Duchess and the kittens. At the end of the fight, Edgar is locked in his own packing-case and sent to Timbuktu. The Aristocats return to Madame Adelaide, who, unaware of the reason for Edgar's departure, rewrites her will to exclude him. After adopting O'Malley into the family, Adelaide establishes a charity foundation, housing stray cats in the mansion. Scat Cat and his gang are the first to move in, and reprise their song so loudly that the two hound dogs can hear it out in the countryside.",

    "plot": "In 1998, Henry \"Hank\" Thompson is a bartender living on the Lower East Side. He calls his mother in Patterson, California, every day, especially to discuss their shared love of the San Francisco Giants. Hank is haunted by a drunken car crash that killed his friend and ended his major league baseball ambitions, and left him with a dependency on alcohol. Hank's neighbor Russ Miner is returning to London to see his ailing father, tasking Hank to care for his cat, Bud. Two Russian mobsters, Aleksei and Pavel, later arrive in search of Russ and viciously beat Hank, who has his kidney removed. After the Russians break into Russ's apartment, narcotics detective Elise Roman questions Hank and reveals Russ is a drug dealer connected to the notorious Hasidic Drucker brothers. Finding a key hidden in Bud's litter box, Hank notifies Roman when the Druckers search Russ's apartment. After getting drunk at Paul's Bar, Hank leaves his clothes outside his building. Interrogated by the Russians and their Puerto Rican associate Colorado, Hank cannot remember what happened to the key. Hank leaves the injured Bud with his girlfriend Yvonne, and remembers taking the key to the bar. Chased by the Druckers, he informs Colorado, who mentions Yvonne. Suddenly realizing she is in danger, he races back to her apartment only to find she has been killed. A guilt-stricken Hank confides in Roman, who tells him of her dreams of retiring to Tulum before revealing herself to be in league with Colorado and the Russians. Roman claims that her gang are not the group responsible for Yvonne's murder. Hank is brought to Paul's Bar, where an altercation results in the killings of Amtrak and Colorado. Lying that the key is in the basement strongroom's safe, Paul retrieves a shotgun but is killed in the ensuing chaos. Hank locks himself in the strongroom, forcing the others to leave empty-handed. Hank recovers the key from the homeless Jason, left in the clothes he abandoned. Russ returns home, but is hit in the head with a baseball bat when Hank mistakes him for an intruder. Russ explains that after selling drugs for the Druckers in Colorado's nightclubs, he was forced to involve Roman, who owes money to the Russians' boss. The key unlocks a storage unit with just over $4 million he was meant to split between the various parties on the day he left for London. Fearing for his life, Russ prepares to take the money and flee the country, leaving Hank as the fall guy, but Hank knocks him unconscious. Meeting with Roman and the Russians, Hank offers them Russ and the key in exchange for Bud. Russ panics and kills Aleksei before escaping with Hank and Bud, suggesting that Roman might have been the one who killed Yvonne. They get away on the subway, where Russ succumbs to his injuries. Hank spends the night on Coney Island. Roman calls the following day, demanding he bring the key to the Russians' supper club otherwise he will be framed for the several murders, and hints at killing his mother. After calling to warn her, Hank goes to see the Druckers. They agree to kill Roman in exchange for Hank leading them to the money. As they arrive at the club, Hank is restrained to the steering wheel while the Druckers carry out shooting the place up. Hank breaks free when seeing Roman flee and chases her. He injures Roman by impaling her foot with the broken baseball bat handle, whereupon the Druckers arrive to kill her. Hank reveals where he hid the key, and the brothers decide to let him live with a share of the money. They force him to drive them home, when Hank notices that Lipa has Yvonne's lighter. Realizing this, the brothers admit they killed Yvonne to send a message to Hank for evading them. Hank purposefully crashes the car, this time killing the two brothers. Some time later, Hank escapes to Tulum while posing as Russ, mailing the other half of the money to his mother.",

The family only receives information telling them who must be killed and after completion the tapes appear on the store's doorstep. One evening the Bladecuts receive a new list of teenage victims. Abbie learns that Roger intends to enlist his part-time employee Makenzie as the 'Son of Bladecut', enraging her as she desperately wants to follow in his footsteps. Roger offers an olive branch by allowing Abbie to come along as a behind-the-scenes assistant, however the outing goes poorly and Roger dies of a heart attack. Abbie buries him so he can resurrect, however Roger is unable to exit the grave on his own, forcing him to realize that he is getting too old to be an effective serial killer. The following night Abbie is sent to assist Mackenzie, only for him to accidentally kill himself while stalking two victims. Abbie is forced to slay them herself, an act that leaves her nauseated. She then decides to take over as the 'Spawn of Bladecut', enlisting her friend Glenn as a helper in exchange for him appearing in the movies as a non-victim.

Abbie decides to enroll at the local high school to stalk the remaining victims, Izzy, Patty, Sam, and Mitch, befriending them and falling for one of them, Sam. This concerns Roger, who warns her that this will make it harder to kill them later. He is proven right when Abbie fails to kill Izzy, causing Roger to kill her instead. The remaining teens decide to try and leave the town but end up hiding out in an abandoned summer camp, the site of Roger's origin story. That night Roger kills Mitch, prompting Patty to correctly assume that Abbie is involved. Patty almost kills Abbie, but is instead killed by Sam, who is unaware of Abbie's involvement. Sam and Abbie are then chased by Roger, who pins Sam to the ground, where he starts choking her to death.

She heads to his grave, which is now empty. The film ends with the appearance of a newly revived Sam, as Abbie chose to bury her in her father's grave.",

    "plot": "An ambitious widow named Rebekka has two ugly daughters named Elvira and Alma; an older widower named Otto has one beautiful daughter named Agnes. Debt-ridden and each mistaking the other to have money, Otto and Rebekkah marry and blend their families. Rebekka's hopes of wealth and privilege are dashed when on her wedding night, Otto vomits blood and dies and the family learns that he is actually penniless. Agnes behaves haughtily towards her stepmother and two stepsisters for their low status. She also reprimands her stepmother for spending money on her daughter's beauty instead of paying to bury her father, whose corpse is rotting. To improve their household finances, Rebekka plans to marry off Elvira, her eldest daughter, to Prince Julian. While Elvira dreams of marrying the shallow Prince, Rebekka knows her daughter is ugly and has next to no chance of winning him over, especially if pitted against the conventionally beautiful Agnes. To improve her looks, Rebekka subjects Elvira to a series of painful and primitive cosmetic surgeries. Elvira also swallows a tapeworm egg to lose weight and is made to take finishing lessons; during dance lessons, Agnes is allowed to stand at the front of the room, whereas Elvira is relegated to the back of the room with the uglier girls in the class. The pressure causes Elvira's initial admiration for her stepsister to turn to resentment, as she feels that Agnes did not have to work for her looks or talent. One night, Elvira discovers Agnes having sex with Isak, a stable man, and reports it to Rebekka. Disgusted, Rebekka throws Isak out and makes Agnes a servant girl, and the family starts calling her Cinderella. As the royal ball approaches, Elvira becomes malnourished and her hair starts falling out in clumps. When Elvira encounters Prince Julian in the woods, he mocks her for her ugliness and is revealed to be a shallow womanizer, but Elvira clings to her belief that he is a kind and loving man. During a dress fitting with her mother, the dress seller gives Elvira a wig and gown. He notices Agnes' beauty and makes inappropriate advances on her. She spits on him and on the floor in disgust, which Rebekka instructs her to clean up. When they return, Elvira sees Agnes with a ball gown and angrily destroys it. Meanwhile, Alma is frightened when she has her first period that night, but does not tell her mother for fear she will be subjected to the same pain Elvira is. Later, Agnes cries over her father's corpse. She has a vision of her biological mother, who gives her a beautiful pair of shoes and warns her that the carriage turns back into a pumpkin by midnight. Silkworms fix Agnes' torn gown. At the ball, Elvira attracts Prince Julian's interest, but his attention is quickly stolen by a veiled Agnes, who arrives late. Elvira escapes to another room and vomits up tapeworm eggs. Later, both women return home. Aware that Agnes accidentally left behind a slipper that Julian will use to identify his dream woman, Elvira attacks and forces Agnes to hand over the other shoe. When she discovers that her feet are too large for the slippers, Elvira attempts to sever her toes. She is found by Rebekka and Alma, the latter of whom is horrified when Rebekka calmly sedates Elvira and completes the task. The next morning, a wounded Elvira hears the trumpets announcing the Prince's arrival. She crawls on the floor, unable to walk, and falls down a flight of stairs, breaking her nose and chipping her tooth. She discovers that Agnes and the Prince have successfully found one another, making her efforts wasted. Defeated, Elvira listens to Alma, takes an antidote and vomits up a large tapeworm. The sisters leave their mother so they can live free of her influence, while Rebekka fellates a man she met at the ball. In a post-credits scene, it is revealed that Otto's rotting corpse remains in his house.",

    "plot": "Sonu Model is a skilled beautician who runs a thriving beauty salon in the heart of Hyderabad's Old City. Known for his impeccable makeup artistry and unique ability to transform appearances, he has built a reputation among his clients. One day, Sonu notices that one of his clients, Jyoti, looks dull, and he asks her the reason for her sadness. She tells him that her husband Nagaraj's cooking oil business is not profitable and that improving it might require an investment of two lakhs. Moved by Jyoti's story, Sonu decides to help her by lending her two lakhs and instantly transfers the money to her account. He also tells her that they can use his photo for their cooking oil business, which may help them succeed. Then, a woman comes to the beauty parlor, claiming to be the wife of Sub-Inspector Shankar, and demands all services for free. Sonu calls Kamala, Shankar's actual wife, and informs her that Shankar's second wife has come to his parlor. Shankar's two wives fight in front of the parlor, and Shankar arrives to calm them down, but both wives leave him. Enraged at being exposed, Shankar becomes furious and is determined to take revenge on Sonu. Khaidi, a man obsessed with Chiranjeevi's movies, is searching for a bride for his son Rustum, along with his wife Subhalekha. However, Khaidi rejects every potential bride, insisting that he wants a daughter-in-law named after a Chiranjeevi movie. Meanwhile, Rustum locks Satthi, a man who had messed with Rustum's father Khaidi, inside a goat shed after learning that Khaidi had rejected the marriage alliance. That night, Shankar meets Khalil Bhai and offers him money to cut off Sonu's fingers. As instructed, Khalil Bhai tries to attack Sonu, but Sonu manages to defeat him and his goons. It is there that Sonu sees Jenny in a nearby tiffin center and falls for her instantly. The following day, he meets her at the gym and tries to impress her. Although she is hesitant at first, as they meet over the next few days, she also falls for him. Defeated, Khalil Bhai meets Rustum and asks him to warn Sonu on his behalf. However, Rustum thinks that since Sonu runs a beauty parlor, he might be the key to finding a suitable bride and orders his sidekick to abduct all the unmarried girls from Sonu's beauty parlor. At the same time, a lady and her daughter Sundari visit Sonu at the parlor and ask him to give Sundari a makeover to change her appearance. Sonu works on transforming Sundari's look using makeup, but just then, Rustum's henchmen try to abduct Sonu's clients. Sonu beats up the henchmen and completes Sundari's makeover, completely changing her appearance. Seeing his henchmen beaten up, Rustum rushes into the beauty parlor, where he bumps into Sundari and is impressed by her new look. Later, Rustum and his family visit Sundari and her family, propose marriage, and then Rustum marries Sundari. Throughout their courtship, Sundari was fully covered in makeup. The next morning, after the wedding night, when she serves coffee to Khaidi without makeup, he is shocked and becomes paralyzed. Rustum's henchmen vandalize the beauty parlor by throwing stones and chase Sonu, her friend Pinky, and Jenny. They manage to escape and hide in Waseem Chacha's clothing store. There, they see the news that the cooking oil used for the wedding of Sundari and Rustum was Minar oil, which is adulterated. As a result, over 100 people fall ill and become hospitalized. Since Sonu's photo was used on the oil cans, Shankar fabricates a case against Sonu, and the police are searching for him. With no other choice, Sonu decides to disguise himself as a woman named Laila by applying makeup, wearing clothing, and using a wig. The next day, pretending to be Laila, he opens the beauty parlor. Rustum is impressed by Laila's looks during the parlor's opening ceremony and befriends her. When Rustum returns home, he tells his mother, Subhalekha that he met a girl, but she is enraged and tries to attack him. Sundari intervenes, suggesting that they meet the girl in person and consider marriage if she is beautiful. Rustum's mother asks him to bring Laila so they can meet her. Sonu, dressed as Laila, meets his old clients in a secret meeting and explains that he is pretending to be a woman only to save the beauty parlor, which is the only thing his mother Sita left for him. Meanwhile, Jyoti tries to contact someone, but Nagaraj stops her. Jyoti asks him not to betray Sonu, but he slaps her and snatches the phone from her. After meeting his clients, Sonu, disguised as Laila, drives back to his beauty parlor but is stopped by a police constable who asks for his driving license. Since there is no driving license in the name of Laila, Laila tries to bribe the police, but police constable Krishna reports this to Shankar. When Laila approaches Shankar, he lusts after her and tries to flirt but is interrupted by Rustum, who drops Laila off at the beauty parlor and invites her to his birthday party. Laila, Jenny, and Pinky attend the party. Rustum's mother examines Laila's skin and says it is not just makeup, and she likes the girl, making Rustum happy that he has found a beautiful woman. Later, Satthi and his brothers-in-law try to kill Rustum, but Laila and Rustum manage to beat them. In order to find Jyoti and Nagaraj, Laila meets Shankar and offers to help him arrest Sonu if he brings Nagaraj to the location she specifies. Believing Laila, Shankar brings Nagaraj to the designated place, where, as planned, Jenny, Pinky, and the other clients of Sonu abduct Nagaraj. Meanwhile, Rustum abducts Laila and takes her to a marriage hall to marry her. Shankar discovers the marriage hall and engages in a fight with Rustum over Laila. During the fight, Laila's wig falls off, revealing that it is actually Sonu who has been pretending to be Laila. Later, Sonu, his clients, and Jenny prove Sonu's innocence in the adulterated cooking oil case by bringing Jyoti and Nagaraj to court. Ultimately, Rustum and his parents accept Sundari.",

At school, Harper is constantly annoyed by her new classmate, British immigrant Lily Reyes, due to her snobbish personality. When Harper and Lily cause an incident in chemistry class, Anna is called to the principal's office, meets Lily's father Eric, and they fall in love. Six months later, they are engaged, and the soon-to-be stepsisters are dissatisfied with their predicament. Harper also worries that her mother will consider moving them to London as Lily wants to return there to attend a fashion academy in honor of her late mother. During Anna's bachelorette party, Anna and Tess and later Harper and Lily have separate palm readings from the supposed psychic Madame Jen, who tells Harper and Lily a fortune about their fractured lives. An earthquake then occurs, which only the four feel. The next morning, they discover that they switched bodies; Anna with Harper, and Tess with Lily. The experienced Anna and Tess advise Harper and Lily to pretend to be each other rather than telling anyone about the switch until they can change back. Realizing their new identities could help them break their parents apart, Harper and Lily lie about Madame Jen giving them a reading to delay the reverse. Anna and Tess go to school and spend time in detention for a food fight Harper and Lily caused at a bake sale, while Harper and Lily enjoy the advantages of being adults and come up with a sabotage plan to cancel the wedding. At a photoshoot of Anna's client Ella, Harper and Lily help the young singer overcome her recent break-up. They learn about Anna's abandoned rock star dreams and find a love song, which they assume Anna wrote about her high school ex-boyfriend Jake Austin. They seek Jake, and Harper embarrasses herself when unsuccessfully trying to seduce him in Anna's body to disrupt the relationship with Eric. After escaping detention, Anna and Tess find Madame Jen, who reveals Harper and Lily's fortune but warns them that all the four of them need to \"change their hearts\" in order to change back. Meanwhile, Harper, as Anna, goes to an immigration interview with Eric, and finds out how much he knows about and loves her mother. Eric also says that he thinks it would be the best for their families to stay in Los Angeles, causing Harper to have second thoughts about their sabotage plan. Lily, however, remains determined. She invites Jake to the rehearsal dinner and makes a scene by criticizing the Colemans, leading to a big public argument. Eric decides he cannot continue this way, and calls off the wedding. Following a heartfelt conversation with Tess about her homesickness and the loss of her mother, Lily starts to realize the error of her ways. As Tess, she tries to convince her father not to give up on Anna. At the same time Anna, followed by Harper, is called to Ella's concert, learning that Ella invited her old band, the Pink Slip, so they could perform together again. Although happy for the reunion, Anna tells Harper she never regretted abandoning her musician goals because Harper is the best decision she ever made, and the love song was actually written about her. Mother and daughter reconnect as they play the song together on stage. Tess and Lily arrive in time to see it, with Lily happily stating she wants to be a part of this family. Having a change of heart, they all return to their original bodies. Eric arrives to the concert, and he and Anna rekindle their relationship. The wedding is held the next day.

Carey and Ashley pull over to help, finding the husband barely conscious and the wife ejected from her seat. Despite Ashley's attempts to perform CPR, the wife is pronounced dead. Shaken, Ashley admits to Carey that she wants a divorce and has been unfaithful. An upset Carey flees to the beach house of his best friend Paul and his wife Julie. While consoling Carey, Paul and Julie admit that they are in an open relationship, shocking Carey. The next day, a confrontation arises when a man accuses Paul and Julie's son Russ of stealing his jet ski. With Paul away on a business trip, Carey defends Julie; the situation escalates into a fight until Julie intervenes by striking the accuser. That night, Carey and Julie spend time together, bond, and eventually have sex. When Paul returns to the house the next day, Carey tells him about the previous night. Paul becomes furious, leading to a violent argument and fight in the house. Julie and Russ return home during the fight; Julie forces both men to apologize. Carey later joins Julie and Russ at a carnival, but becomes jealous and aggressive after seeing Brent, the father of a friend of Russ, flirt with Julie. Julie confronts Carey, who admits the sexual encounter meant more to him than expected. Julie urges him to move on. Carey returns home and finds Ashley sleeping with another man. Ashley attempts to convince Carey to leave, but Carey instead suggests entering an open relationship to avoid divorce. Ashley hesitantly agrees after Carey reveals he has already slept with another woman, but does not reveal that it was Julie. Ashley takes on a series of short-term lovers, whom Carey casually befriends and invites to live in the house, much to Ashley's irritation. Now separated from Julie, Paul arrives at Carey and Ashley's apartment to confront him, leading Ashley to learn that the other woman was Julie. Julie encounters Carey working at Russ's school, and informs him that Paul's company has been shut down, their assets are frozen, and they are bankrupt. Julie also admits that she never slept with another person during her relationship with Paul. Carey reveals his growing feelings for Julie, which she reciprocates. Paul witnesses Carey and Julie kiss and passive-aggressively tries to get Carey to admit that they are seeing each other. After a disciplinary meeting at Russ's school, Julie angrily confronts Paul for getting indicted and taking out loans in Russ's name and spitefully admits to her relationship with Carey. Paul is sent to jail, and after being released, he agrees to sign divorce papers for Julie. Paul and Ashley, who has become frustrated at Carey's relationship with Julie and indifference to her relationships, consider having sex with each other to make their exes jealous, but decide not to go through with it. At Russ's birthday party, Ashley arrives with her lover Matt, who is performing as a mentalist for the party, while Paul brings a woman closely resembling Julie to provoke her. Ashley attempts to win Carey back, and Carey confesses he was jealous of Ashley's lovers and befriended them to irritate her. Ashley kisses Carey, who insists on remaining friends. Julie privately confronts Paul, who admits that he also never slept with anyone else during their relationship and proposed the open relationship out of insecurity. They reconcile and have sex, which Carey walks in on. Carey, Paul, Ashley, and Julie get into an argument over their situation, which nearly escalates into another fight between Carey and Paul before they are forced to extinguish a fire caused by Russ's birthday candles. Some time later, Carey and Ashley are back together and have had a baby. Paul and Julie remain separated but maintain a sexual relationship. While all the adults are at Paul and Julie's former beach house, now being used as an Airbnb property, Carey and Paul get into a fight with the Airbnb owner for accusing Russ of stealing his jet ski.

Dawn is thrilled to be accepted to an art school in Paris, but she is short of funds for both years after spending some of her savings on Birdie's medical expenses. A huge fan of dating reality show \"The Honeypot\", Dawn's sister Emily talks her into auditioning for the show, as the appearance fee for contestants would help cover her studies. Dawn reluctantly accepts to attend an audition and is surprised to learn she will be cast for the upcoming season, which will be taking place in Paris. Later, the two sisters go out for a drink and play pool to celebrate, where Dawn flirts with an immaculately dressed cowboy. When Dawn embarks on the plane with the other contestants, they are dismayed to find out the season's twist once they land; the location is set on a ranch in Paris, Texas, a town which is not far from Dawn's home. Arriving at Silver Spur Ranch, they are told they will meet the bachelor Trey McAllen III the next day. Dawn runs into him in a barn, where he is revealed to be the cowboy she met earlier. Dawn asks to be removed from the competition, as the allure of the show for her is ruined because it's the \"wrong\" Paris. However, the show's producer Rachel reminds Dawn that her contract stipulates that she will not be paid if she quits the show. Dawn feels confident she can get rejected on purpose at the first barbecue event, as ten women will be eliminated right after. Talking very familiarly with Trey on camera, Rachel determines their previous encounters were brief enough to not create a conflict of interest. Dawn is also foiled by Trey himself, who has taken an interest in her. Reluctantly smitten by Trey and still motivated by the prize money, Dawn learns through fellow competitor Jasmine that she can earn extra by securing dates with him, leading Dawn to actively compete in the show. Winning the axe throw, she cooks with Trey on their date. At the obstacle course, the six remaining women end up fighting. When the ranch's horses break free during the challenge, Trey and Dawn become closer, as she volunteers to help find them. That night, the two sneak out of the farm for a day away from the cameras and hook up. Later, driving to her house, Trey sees her metal sculptures and meets her family. Their blossoming romance hits a snag after Dawn's rival Lexi tattles to Trey that she only did the show for the money, and a heartbroken Trey eliminates Dawn. Dawn shortly starts attending art school in Paris, but Rachel tracks her down and urges her to reveal her feelings to Trey. Given a gown, Dawn shows up to the final location, where Lexi and Jasmine are kept away. Despite initially refusing Dawn's apology, Trey realizes her sincerity upon discovering she forfeited all she had earned on the show to see him again. After they formally reunite, Trey suggests Dawn reject him live on camera so she can secure the $250,000 \"honeypot\"; Dawn takes the money and immediately kisses Trey.",

    "title": "The Wolf of Wall Street",
    "plot": "In 1987, twenty-five-year-old Jordan Belfort lands a job as a Wall Street stockbroker for L.F. Rothschild, employed under Mark Hanna. He is quickly enticed by the drug-fueled stockbroker culture and Hanna's belief that a broker's only goal is to make money for himself. Jordan loses his job following Black Monday, the largest one-day stock market drop in history after the Wall Street crash of 1929, and takes a job at Investor's Center, a boiler room brokerage firm on Long Island that specializes in pink sheet penny stocks. He makes a small fortune thanks to his aggressive pitching style and high commissions. Jordan befriends his neighbor Donnie Azoff, and the two start their own boiler room-styled brokerage company. They recruit Jordan's childhood friends Robbie Feinberg, Alden Kupferburg, Nicky Koskoff, Chester Ming, and Toby Welch, as well as local drug pusher Brad Bonick, all of whom Jordan trains in the art of the \"hard sell,\" and set up the company in an abandoned auto repair shop. Jordan's tactics and salesmanship largely contribute to the success of his pump and dump scheme, in which misleading, positive statements inflate a stock's price so it can be sold at an artificially high price. When the scheme's perpetrators sell their overvalued securities, the price plummets, and those who were conned into buying at the inflated price are left with stock that is suddenly worth much less than they paid for it. To cloak this, Jordan gives the firm the respectable-sounding name of Stratton Oakmont in 1989. Soon after, the company becomes immensely successful, moving out of the auto repair shop into a bigger office. An exposé in Forbes which dubs Jordan \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" – \"a sort of twisted Robin Hood who takes from the rich and gives to himself and his merry band of brokers\"— initially enrages Belfort until it causes hundreds of ambitious young financiers to flock to the company, thus causing them to move into even bigger offices. As all this is happening, Jordan becomes immensely successful, and slides into a decadent lifestyle of prostitutes and drugs. He has an affair with lingerie designer Naomi Lapaglia; when his wife Teresa finds out about this, Jordan divorces her and marries Naomi in 1991. Meanwhile, the SEC and the FBI begin investigating Stratton Oakmont. In 1993, Jordan illegally makes $22 million in three hours after securing the IPO of Steve Madden, Ltd., founded by Donnie's childhood friend and women's shoes designer Steve Madden, bringing him and his firm further FBI attention. Jordan tries to bribe agent Denham but fails, prompting him to seek a safe place for the money. He opens a Swiss bank account with corrupt banker Jean-Jacques Saurel in the name of Naomi's aunt Emma, a British citizen who is outside the immediate reach of American authorities. He uses Brad's Swiss-Slovenian wife Chantalle and her family, who have European passports, to smuggle the cash into Switzerland. Donnie and Brad get into a heated argument in public during a money exchange, resulting in Brad's arrest as Donnie escapes. Donnie informs Jordan that he has come upon some lemmon 714 quaaludes, which the latter refers to as \"the holy grail\" of drugs. The two take the pills at Belfort’s home, but they have no effect. They assume that they have expired, and wind up taking the rest of their supply. Jordan's private investigator Bo Dietl calls him and tells him he needs to talk to him on a payphone. Jordan drives to a local country club and calls Bo, who informs him that the FBI is wiretapping his phones. While talking with Bo, the quaaludes kick in, and Jordan becomes extremely inebriated, struggling to get home in his Lamborghini Countach. When he gets home, he finds Donnie talking on the phone, and nearly strangles him with the phone cord. Donnie chokes on some meat; Jordan ingests a large amount of cocaine and gives him the Heimlich maneuver. The next day, the police arrive and inform Jordan that his car has been trashed. Fearing for his son, Jordan's father Max advises him to leave Stratton Oakmont and lie low while Jordan's lawyer negotiates a deal to keep him out of prison. In the midst of his farewell speech, Jordan cannot bear to quit and talks himself into staying, to the immense support of his friends and employees, but to the anger of his father. In 1996, Jordan, Donnie, and their wives are on a yacht trip to Italy, when they learn that Emma has died of a heart attack. Fearing for the money he left under her name in his Swiss account, Jordan announces that they will chart a course to Switzerland to forge her name on a document and save the account before going to London for the funeral. To bypass the border patrols, he orders his yacht captain Ted to sail to Monaco, but their ship capsizes in a storm. After their rescue, the plane sent to take them to Geneva is destroyed when a seagull flies into the engine; Jordan takes this as a sign from God to address his worsening drug addiction and attempts to sober up. In 1998, Saurel and Koskoff are arrested for an unrelated crime, the former informing the FBI about Jordan as part of a plea bargain. Since the evidence against him is overwhelming, Jordan agrees to gather evidence from the rest of his colleagues in exchange for leniency. After having sex for the last time, Naomi tells Jordan that she is divorcing him, and wants full custody of their daughter and infant son. In a cocaine-fueled rage, Jordan punches Naomi and tries to drive away with their daughter, but crashes his car in the driveway. Later, Jordan wears a wire to work and slips a note to Donnie, warning his partner. However, the note is shortly found by the FBI, who arrest Jordan, before they raid and shut down Stratton Oakmont. Despite breaching his deal, Jordan receives a reduced sentence of 36 months in a minimum security prison for his testimony, and is released in 2000 after serving 22 months. After his release, Jordan makes a living hosting seminars on sales techniques, using the same test he used with his founding partners at his firm.",

Initially, Gulshan finds the task incredibly challenging, struggling to connect with his new team due to their unique conditions and individual needs. His patience is frequently tested, and he often feels overwhelmed by the responsibility. As Gulshan grudgingly begins working with the team, he slowly starts to understand their individual struggles and strengths. A significant turning point in his coaching approach comes when he helps Guddu, one of the players, overcome his debilitating fear of bathing, a phobia that has caused significant distress. This small victory marks the beginning of a deeper bond between Gulshan and his team. During this period, the team gains a new, charismatic member, Golu Khan, whose infectious enthusiasm further brightens the group's spirits and dynamic. Despite the numerous hurdles, the team's dedication and spirit remain strong. Their efforts culminate in them qualifying for a major basketball tournament in Mumbai. The journey to the city becomes a period of personal growth for Gulshan as well. While en route, he confronts and ultimately overcomes his own long-standing phobia of lifts, a personal battle he had previously avoided. Upon arriving in Mumbai, Gulshan receives a shock when he discovers that his mother is romantically involved with their family cook, a revelation that deeply unsettles him and adds a layer of personal turmoil to his professional commitments. The much-anticipated tournament finally arrives. The team, despite their best efforts and renewed confidence, ultimately loses the final match. However, the outcome does not diminish their spirits. Instead of despairing, the players and Gulshan celebrate their journey, their improvements, and the bonds they have forged. In a moment of profound realization, Gulshan understands that while he believed he was coaching them, the players had, in fact, been his true coaches, teaching him invaluable lessons about resilience, acceptance, and joy. The film concludes on a heartwarming note as Gulshan, who had previously been hesitant about starting a family, embraces the news that his wife, Sunita, is pregnant with their first child, symbolizing his complete personal transformation and newfound readiness for fatherhood.",

    "plot": "In 1981 a feather lands at a bus stop in Savannah, Georgia, where Forrest Gump recounts his life story to strangers on a bus bench. In 1950s Alabama, Forrest is fitted with leg braces to correct a curved spine. His mother runs a boarding house out of their home. Among their tenants is Elvis Presley, who incorporates Forrest's jerky dance movements into his performances. On his first day of school, Forrest befriends a girl named Jenny Curran. Forrest is often bullied because of his physical disability and low intelligence. While fleeing from several bullies, his leg braces break off, revealing Forrest to be a very fast runner. This talent eventually allows him to receive a football scholarship at the University of Alabama in 1963, where he is coached by Bear Bryant, and witnesses Governor George Wallace's Stand in the Schoolhouse Door, during which he returns a dropped book to Vivian Malone Jones. Forrest becomes a top kick returner, is named to the All-American team, and meets President John F. Kennedy at the White House. After graduating college in 1966, Forrest is drafted into the U.S. Army where he befriends Benjamin Buford \"Bubba\" Blue, who convinces Forrest to go into the shrimping business with him after their service. They arrive in Vietnam in 1967 and serve with the 9th Infantry Division in the Mekong Delta. Their platoon is ambushed during a patrol, Bubba is killed in action, and Forrest saves several wounded platoon mates – including his lieutenant, Dan Taylor. Gump is awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism by President Lyndon B. Johnson. At the anti-war March on the Pentagon rally, Forrest meets Abbie Hoffman and briefly reunites with Jenny, who has been living a hippie lifestyle. He also develops a talent for ping-pong, and becomes a sports celebrity as he competes against Chinese teams in ping-pong diplomacy, earning him an interview alongside John Lennon on The Dick Cavett Show, influencing the song \"Imagine\". He spends the 1971 New Year's Eve in New York City with Dan, who lost his legs in Vietnam and has become deeply embittered. Forrest meets President Richard Nixon, who grants him a room in the Watergate Hotel, where he unwittingly exposes the Watergate scandal. Discharged from the Army, Forrest returns to Alabama and endorses a ping-pong paddle manufacturer, using the earnings to buy a shrimping boat in Bayou La Batre, fulfilling his promise to Bubba. Dan joins Forrest in 1974, and their lack of success changes when their boat becomes the sole survivor of Hurricane Carmen. They create the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, Dan reconciles himself to his disabilities, and finally thanks Forrest for saving his life. Forrest returns home to his mother as she dies of cancer. Dan invests in Apple Computer and the two become millionaires, but Forrest also shares their earnings with the community and Bubba's family. Jenny returns to stay with Forrest in 1976, recovering from years of child abuse, drugs, and prostitution. When Forrest proposes to her, she tells him she loves him and the two have sex, but she leaves the next morning. Heartbroken, Forrest spends the next three years in a relentless cross-country run. In 1981, Forrest reveals that he is waiting at the bus stop because he received a letter from Jenny inviting him to visit. She introduces him to their son, Forrest Gump Jr. Jenny tells Forrest she is sick with an unknown incurable virus, and the three move back to Alabama. Jenny and Forrest marry, but she dies a year later. Forrest sends his son off on his first day of school as the feather from the movie's opening floats on the wind.",

Unbeknownst to the others, Sam is a secret agent, having arranged the trip to intercept a rogue bioweapon, but her disappearance from the party leads Betsy to drunkenly name her fiancé's sister Virginia as maid of honor instead. Sam's handler Nadine urges her to attend the wedding anyway, and she arrives in Savannah, Georgia for the festivities, meeting Betsy's fiancé Ryan Caldwell and his wealthy family at their private island estate. Ostracized from the bridal party, Sam flirts with the best man Chris, much to Virginia's jealousy. Before the ceremony begins, Sam's attempt to comfort Betsy backfires, and she slips away after Betsy suggests they have grown apart as friends. The wedding is taken hostage by a team of mercenaries led by Kurt, who demands access to the Caldwells' vault, which is keyed to the family's wedding rings. Ryan is shot in the leg when it is revealed that Chris, the son of the Caldwells' jailed former business partner, is in league with Kurt. Sam evades capture, subduing several mercenaries and Chris before being assumed dead, but Betsy spots her fighting her way to the kitchen. Convincing Kurt to let her find food for the hostages, Betsy reunites with Sam, who has taken Ryan's ring from Chris. Betsy returns to the hostages and they overpower the guards, escaping through the house's secret passages to a nearby train depot, while Sam creates a distraction and is captured. Unlocking the vault, the mercenaries steal a fortune in gold bars and an incriminating hard drive, which Chris believes will exonerate his father. Before Kurt can execute them, Sam flees with Chris to the family's distillery, where the mercenaries leave them to boil alive inside a whiskey still, but the bridal party returns to rescue them. Firing on the mercenaries with the estate's antique cannon, Sam and Betsy give chase across the grounds in a hovercraft, pursued by Chris. Sam fights off the mercenaries and throws Kurt overboard, while Chris demands the hard drive at gunpoint, but Sam and Betsy jump to safety as he crashes in a fiery explosion. Having realized Sam was in danger, Nadine arrives with a rescue team, capturing Kurt and his men. At the train depot, Betsy marries Ryan in an impromptu ceremony, but they are interrupted by a badly burned Chris, who has Kurt's detonator for explosives planted throughout the house. He is disarmed by a sympathetic Sam, who explains that the hard drive proves his father was working for the mercenaries' criminal employers. Catching the wedding bouquet, Sam accidentally hits the detonator, destroying the Caldwell mansion. Virginia returns the maid of honor role to Sam, who makes a heartfelt toast to Betsy and their friendship, and swears the party to secrecy about her life as a secret agent.",

One year later, following a heated argument between Ted and Tami-Lynn, their co-worker Joy suggests to him that they have a baby to keep their marriage alive. When Ted discusses it with Tami-Lynn, she loves the idea, so they both agree to have one. As Ted cannot father a child, John decides to help find a sperm donor. After failed attempts to find a donor, John ultimately offers to donate his own sperm, but Tami-Lynn is found to be infertile due to past drug use. Subsequently, the couple decide to adopt. The background checks bring Ted's legal status as a person into question, and the Massachusetts state authorities declare Ted to be property rather than human. As a result, Ted loses his job, his credit card and bank accounts are terminated, and his marriage to Tami-Lynn is annulled. John suggests that they take the state to court. Approaching the best lawyer they can find, he assigns the case pro bono to his niece Sam L. Jackson, a novice lawyer. They are initially reluctant due to her lack of pop culture knowledge but bond over their love of marijuana as they prepare to present the case. Meanwhile, Donny, Ted's life-long stalker, is now a janitor at Hasbro's headquarters in NYC. He proposes to the SVP to abduct Ted for research to manufacture live teddy bears commercially. Donny convinces him to hire an expert attorney to ensure that Ted maintains his status as property. Despite Sam's best efforts, the court rules against Ted. Disheartened and desperate, the trio contact Patrick Meighan, a highly respected civil rights attorney, to help overturn the court's decision. During a Manhattan trip to meet him, John and Sam fall in love and eventually kiss. When the trio meets Meighan, he is sympathetic to Ted's plight but ultimately refuses the case, as he believes Ted has not significantly contributed to humanity due to his hedonistic lifestyle. Furious at the injustice and jealous of John's relationship with Sam, Ted takes out his frustrations on the two and angrily leaves. He wanders into the New York Comic-Con while Donny, as a Raphael cosplayer, discreetly follows Ted inside. When Ted encounters Donny, he flees and Donny chases him. Ted steals another person's cell phone to contact Sam and John to inform them of his situation, just before Donny abducts him. John and Sam arrive and find Ted, just as Donny is about to cut him open, so John punches Donny in the face. Ted quickly reconciles with John and Sam. However, as they are leaving Donny has regained consciousness. He severs the cables holding up a display model of the Enterprise-D, so it swings towards Ted. John pushes him out of the way to save him, but is hit and rendered unconscious. Donny is arrested after Ted exposes him. John is rushed to the hospital, where he flatlines. The next day, the group is told that he has died and tearfully visits him, but he opens his eyes. John reveals the doctors revived him, then worked with him afterward to prank them. Although Sam is initially furious, she and John kiss as the group rejoices. Inspired by John's selflessness and Ted's emotions over the injured John, which is filmed and shown on the news, Meighan decides to take their case. He successfully overturns the ruling by demonstrating that Ted is self-aware, feels complex emotions, and is capable of empathy. Ted proposes to Tami-Lynn again as they leave court. Sometime later, Ted and Tami-Lynn are remarried and adopt a baby boy, naming him after Rocky character Apollo Creed while John and Sam happily pursue their relationship. John even gives Apollo a teddy bear of his own. Later on, in a post-credit scene, an intimidating Irishman who previously bought a box of Trix from Ted at the grocery store returns to the empty store, seemingly injured.

As the family has financial struggles and low-income jobs, family friend Min-hyuk gives them a scholar's rock meant to promise wealth. Leaving to study abroad, he suggests that Ki-woo lie about his qualifications to take over Min-hyuk's job as an English tutor for Da-hye, the daughter of the wealthy but naïve Park family. Min-hyuk trusts Ki-woo because he likes Da-hye and wants to ask her out when he returns. After Ki-jung helps forge a certificate for him, Ki-woo, posing as a Yonsei University student named \"Kevin\", goes to the Parks' home. The mother explains how fond they are of Min and that Ki-woo needs to be up to his standard. She then asks to sit in on Da-hye's first lesson, and he is hired. The Kims scheme to secure jobs for each family member within the Park household while concealing their true identities. Ki-woo recommends \"Jessica,\" actually Ki-jung, as an art therapist for the Parks' young son, Da-song, who has been traumatised after seeing a \"ghost\" in their kitchen. Ki-jung then frames Yoon, the Parks' chauffeur, by making it appear as though he had a sexual encounter in the car, leading to Ki-taek being hired as his replacement. The Kims exploit the peach allergy of the Parks' longtime housekeeper, Moon-gwang, to convince Mrs Park that Moon-gwang has tuberculosis, and Chung-sook is hired as her replacement. Meanwhile, Ki-woo begins a secret romantic relationship with Da-hye. While the Parks are away on a camping trip, the Kims revel in the luxuries of the house. Moon-gwang appears at the door, claiming to have forgotten something in the basement. She goes through a hidden entrance to an underground bunker created by the house's architect and previous owner, who had kept its existence secret from the Parks. There, Moon-gwang's husband, Geun-sae, has been hiding from loan sharks and is revealed to be the \"ghost\" Da-song saw when he was trying to leave the bunker to steal food. Moon-gwang begs Chung-sook to allow Geun-sae to continue living there in exchange for regular payments, but the three other Kims, who are eavesdropping, accidentally reveal their true identities. Moon-gwang films them and threatens to expose their deception to the Parks. After the Parks call to inform the Kims that they are returning early due to a sudden severe rainstorm, the Kims quickly destroy all evidence of their ruse and subdue Moon-gwang and Geun-sae in the bunker, although Moon-gwang is injured during the struggle. The Kims manage to escape, but the torrential rain floods their flat with sewage water, forcing them to take shelter in a gymnasium alongside other displaced people. The next day, Mrs Park organises an impromptu garden party for Da-song's birthday, with the elder Kims assisting while the younger Kims are invited as guests. Ki-woo enters the bunker with his scholar's rock, intending to kill Geun-sae and Moon-gwang. Moon-gwang is already dead from injuries sustained in the previous day's brawl; Geun-sae bludgeons Ki-woo with the rock, leaving him unconscious. Geun-sae then leaves the bunker and stabs Ki-jung with a kitchen knife in front of horrified party guests. Da-song suffers a seizure upon seeing the \"ghost\" again. Chung-sook impales Geun-sae with a barbecue skewer after a struggle. While Ki-taek tends to Ki-jung, Mr Park orders him to drive Da-song to the hospital. Ki-taek, momentarily enraged by Mr Park's lack of empathy, stabs him with Geun-sae's knife and flees. Weeks later, Ki-woo is recovering from brain surgery, and he and Chung-sook have been convicted of fraud and placed on probation. Ki-jung has died from her injuries, and Ki-taek – now a wanted fugitive – has disappeared. Geun-sae is presumed to have been a random homeless man, and the motives for the murders remain unsolved. Ki-woo spies on the Parks' former home, now owned by a foreign family, and notices a Morse code message in a light visible from outside. Ki-taek, hiding in the bunker, has buried Moon-gwang in the garden and sends daily messages, hoping Ki-woo will see them.

    "plot": "Two days before his wedding, bachelor Doug Billings travels to Las Vegas with his best friends Phil Wenneck, a sarcastic teacher, Stu Price, a dentist, and Alan Garner, his odd future brother-in-law. Sid, the father of Doug's fiancée Tracy, loans Doug his vintage Mercedes-Benz W111 to drive to Vegas. They book a suite at Caesars Palace and celebrate by sneaking onto the hotel rooftop and drinking Jägermeister. The next day, Phil, Stu and Alan awaken, unable to remember the previous night. Doug is nowhere to be found, Stu's tooth is missing, the suite is a mess, a Bengal tiger is in the bathroom, and a baby is in the closet. They see Doug's mattress impaled on a statue outside, and when they ask for their Mercedes, the valet delivers a Las Vegas police cruiser. Retracing their steps, the trio travel to a hospital, discovering they were drugged with Rohypnol, causing their memory loss, and that they went there from a chapel the previous night. At the chapel, they learn that Stu married a call girl named Jade, despite his relationship with his shrewish girlfriend Melissa. Outside the chapel, the trio is attacked by a gang of men demanding to know where \"he\" is. Bewildered, they flee and track down Jade, who is revealed to be the baby's mother. They are arrested by the police for having stolen the cruiser. To get the Mercedes out of impound and an early release, the trio unwittingly volunteered to be targets for a taser demonstration. While driving the car, they discover a naked Chinese man named Leslie Chow in the trunk, who attacks the trio and flees. Alan confesses that he drugged their drinks to ensure they had a good night, believing the drug to be ecstasy. Returning to their suite, they encounter Mike Tyson, who knocks Alan unconscious and demands they return his tiger. After Stu sedates it, they load it into the Mercedes and drive to Tyson's mansion. The tiger awakens and attacks, scratching Phil's neck and damaging the car. They push the car to the mansion and deliver the tiger. Tyson shows them security camera footage of their reckless behavior from the night before, revealing they lost Doug only after returning to the hotel. While driving back, their car is rammed by a black Cadillac Escalade manned by Chow and his gang from the chapel. Chow accuses them of kidnapping him and stealing $80,000 in poker chips. As they deny it, he tells them he has Doug, and threatens to kill him if the chips are not returned. Unable to find Chow's chips, Alan, with help from Stu and Jade, uses his knowledge of card counting to win $82,400 playing blackjack. They meet Chow in the Mojave Desert to exchange the chips for Doug, only to find that the \"Doug\" in question is actually the drug dealer who accidentally sold the wrong drugs to Alan. With the real Doug's wedding set to occur in five hours, Phil calls Tracy to tell her they cannot find him. Simultaneously, the other Doug remarks that someone who takes roofies is more likely to end up on the floor than on the roof, causes Stu to realize where Doug is. They return to Caesars Palace and find a dazed, sunburned Doug on the roof. He was moved there as a joke, forgetting when the roofies wore off; Doug threw his mattress onto a statue to signal for help. Before leaving, Stu arranges to meet Jade for a date next week. With no flights, the four drive home in the damaged Mercedes, where Doug reveals he has Chow's original $80,000. Despite their late arrival, Doug and Tracy are married. At the reception, Stu gleefully breaks up with Melissa, & Sid then reveals to Doug that the Mercedes is a wedding gift. Alan finds Stu's camera with photos from their Las Vegas night, and they consent to view the pictures before deleting them.",

    "plot": "=== Narrative structure === Pulp Fiction's narrative is told out of chronological order and follows three main interrelated stories that each have a different protagonist: Vincent Vega, a hitman; Butch Coolidge, a prizefighter; and Jules Winnfield, Vincent's partner in crime. The film begins with a diner robbery staged by a couple, then begins to shift from one story line to another before returning to the diner for the conclusion. There are seven narrative sequences; the three primary story lines are preceded by intertitles: \"Prologue – The Diner\" (i) \"Prelude to 'Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife'\" \"Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife\" \"Prelude to 'The Gold Watch'\" (a – flashback, b – present) \"The Gold Watch\" \"The Bonnie Situation\" \"Epilogue – The Diner\" (ii) If the seven sequences were ordered chronologically, they would run: 4a, 2, 6, 1, 7, 3, 4b, 5. Sequences 1 and 7 partially overlap and are presented from different points of view, as do sequences 2 and 6. According to Philip Parker, the structural form is \"an episodic narrative with circular events adding a beginning and end and allowing references to elements of each separate episode to be made throughout the narrative\". Other analysts describe the structure as a \"circular narrative\".",

    "plot": "Solène Marchand is a divorced art gallery owner living in Los Angeles. As her 40th birthday nears, she plans a solo camping trip while her ex-husband Daniel takes their teen daughter Izzy and her friends to Coachella. When Daniel is called away by work at the last minute, Solène reluctantly agrees to forgo camping and accompany the teens to the festival. Daniel had arranged for the teens to have a meet-and-greet at the festival with the boy band August Moon. While waiting in the VIP area, Solène enters what she believes is a bathroom, only to discover that it is August Moon member Hayes Campbell's trailer. The pair flirt, although Solène, who is sixteen years older than Hayes, is uncomfortable with their attraction. Later, during August Moon's performance, Hayes seemingly changes the show's setlist, dedicating a song to her. At Solène's birthday party, she finds herself disillusioned with prospective men her age. Shortly after the festival, Hayes shows up unannounced at Solène's gallery, seemingly interested in purchasing art. After he buys every piece in the gallery, Solène takes him to a friend's warehouse studio, where they discuss life and art. At Solène's house for lunch, she reveals her insecurities about her ex-husband's affair, and Hayes reveals his desire to be taken seriously as a musician. They kiss, but Solène rebuffs him. Hayes leaves his watch behind, finds Solène's phone number on the gallery invoice, and texts her to join him in New York City. With Izzy at summer camp, Solène flies to New York and meets him at his hotel, where they have sex. Hayes convinces her to travel with him on August Moon's European tour. Solène wishes to keep their relationship private, so does not tell Izzy or anyone else. As August Moon's European tour goes on, Solène continues supporting Hayes, and the pair continues to be intimate in their hotels. When the band vacations in the south of France, Solène becomes uncomfortable about her age in relation to the other women traveling with them. Other members of the band tell her that Hayes's dedication of a song to her is a tactic they use to impress women and that Hayes has previously pursued relationships with older women. Solène, feeling misled and disillusioned about the relationship, abruptly returns to Los Angeles. Daniel, who has heard about Solène's relationship, questions her about it, but she denies that she and Hayes were together. Soon afterward, paparazzi photos of the relationship surface online, causing Solène to attract large amounts of unwanted attention. When she goes to pick Izzy up at camp, her daughter is furious at having been lied to but forgives her mother. Solène goes to a recording studio where Hayes is working, and they rekindle their relationship, beginning to date publicly. She and her family delete their social media accounts. Daniel expresses concern to Solène about the impact of their relationship on Izzy, who is facing challenges at school as a result. Following a trip to New York, Hayes returns, and Solène ends the relationship once more. However, Hayes visits her home again, suggesting that they should reconsider resuming their relationship in five years once Izzy has completed her schooling. During this encounter, Hayes leaves his watch with Solène once again. Five years later, with Izzy now living in Chicago, Solène sees Hayes performing on The Graham Norton Show, where he mentions plans to visit Los Angeles.

    "plot": "Sandeep Balakrishnan, a wealthy and irritable businessman who runs a successful cloud-kitchen chain in Kochi, lives in isolation despite his wealth and affluence. After undergoing a heart transplant, he quickly returns to his work, dismissing the emotional weight of his surgery. He frequently remarks that “a heart is only an organ,” irritating those around him who expect gratitude and compassion. Weeks later, Sandeep travels to Pune to attend the engagement ceremony of Haritha, the daughter of Colonel Ravindranath—the army officer whose heart saved his life after his brain death due to a car accident. At the event, Sandeep meets Haritha, her mother Devika, and several family friends. His blunt attitude, including his insistence that the transplant creates no sentimental bond, unsettles the family. During the ceremony, Haritha’s engagement abruptly collapses when she learns the groom installed spyware in her phone without her knowing, leading to an argument. Sandeep sustains a back injury during a quarrel and is hospitalized. Unable to return to Kochi, he remains in Pune under the care of the Colonel’s family. His nurse Jerry accompanies him, often creating comic situations with his carefree manner. Sandeep initially treats the arrangement with irritation, avoiding interaction with the household. Over time, however, the kindness of Haritha and Devika begins to soften him. He shares meals with them, listens to stories of Colonel Ravindranath, and witnesses the strength with which they face life’s difficulties. Haritha, still shaken by her broken engagement, gradually finds confidence again through Sandeep’s unexpected support. Devika, who treats Sandeep like a member of the family, helps him reconcile with the emotions he has long denied. Through the course of his time with Haritha, Sandeep begins to develop a fleeting romantic connection with her. But, he then realises that Haritha sees her father in him, and that he was wrong to desire any other kind of relationship with her. Therefore, when Jerry urges him to confess his emotions to Haritha, he refuses, and puts an end to the topic. In the meanwhile, Devika, the colonel's wife, begins to believe that Sandeep is falling for her. Blindsided by this assumption, Sandeep stays silent, but, as their time together draws to a close, Sandeep clarifies with Devika, that all he feels for her is affection and gratitude. Jerry’s antics, along with visits from relatives such as Haritha’s jovial uncle Jacob and Sandeep’s brother-in-law Omanakuttan Panicker, provide lighthearted interludes that contrast with Sandeep’s quiet transformation. Through these days, Sandeep begins to recognize that his new heart carries more than life—it carries the Colonel’s love, memories, and bond with his family. As he integrates into the household, Sandeep changes from a detached survivor into a man who embraces connection. He helps Haritha regain her confidence, encouraging her to pursue her career dreams rather than dwell on her failed marriage proposal. In a climactic sequence, he openly admits to Devika that he had been afraid of closeness all his life, and that the heart transplant not only saved his body but also gave him a family he never thought possible. Also he asks Jerry to be with him and asks her to join his business as a manager. The film concludes with Haritha preparing for a new beginning—leaving behind her past and stepping forward with hope. Devika, smiling through tears, accepts Sandeep as part of her family. In the final scene, Sandeep returns to manage his hotel with Jerry, but has an unexpected encounter with a woman who he thinks is his destined true love, leaving a sense of hope and happiness.",

    "plot": "In the Bronx in 1962, Italian American bouncer Tony Lip searches for new employment while the Copacabana is closed for renovations. He is invited to an interview with Don Shirley, an African American pianist in need of a driver for his eight-week concert tour through the Midwest and Deep South. Don hires Tony on the strength of his references. They embark with plans to return to New York City on Christmas Eve. Don's record label gives Tony a copy of The Negro Motorist Green Book, a guide for African American travelers that contains the addresses of those motels, restaurants, and filling stations that would serve them in the Jim Crow South. Tony and Don initially clash as Tony feels uncomfortable being asked to act with more refinement, while haughty Don is displeased by Tony's habits. As the tour progresses, Tony is impressed with Don's talent on the piano and becomes increasingly appalled by the discriminatory treatment that Don receives from his hosts and the general public when he is not on stage. In Louisville, Kentucky, a group of white men beat Don and threaten his life in a bar before Tony rescues him. He instructs Don not to go out without him for the rest of the tour. Throughout the journey, Don helps Tony write eloquent letters to his wife, which deeply move her. Tony encourages Don to get in touch with his own estranged brother, but Don is hesitant, observing that he has become isolated by his professional life and achievements. Don is later found in a homosexual encounter with a white man in a public shower, and Tony bribes the police officers at the scene to prevent his arrest. In Mississippi, the two are arrested after police officers pull them over late at night in a sundown town, and Tony punches one officer after being insulted. While in jail, Don asks to phone his lawyer and instead uses the call to reach Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, who pressures the governor and police officers to release the two. Once they are free and back on the road, Don reprimands Tony for his distasteful actions, and a heated argument erupts regarding race relations and meritocracy, during which Don expresses frustration at feeling rejected by the black community due to his mannerisms while the white community either mistreats him or uses him to make themselves look open-minded. They eventually find a hotel for the night and manage to reconcile. On the night of Don's final performance in Birmingham, Alabama, he is refused entry into the whites-only dining room of the country club where he has been hired to perform. Tony threatens the manager, and Don refuses to play since they refuse to serve him in the room with his audience. Eventually, Don gives Tony the choice on whether or not he plays, to smooth tensions. Tony chooses his friendship, possibly terminating his contract with the record company that demands Don does not miss a show. Tony and Don leave the venue and instead have dinner at a black blues club, where Don joins the band on piano. The pair head north in an attempt to make it home by Christmas Eve, but are caught in a blizzard. They are then once again pulled over by a police officer. Worried they are about to receive the same treatment as earlier, both are surprised when it turns out the officer had only pulled them over due to their car having a flat tire. The officer helps them fix the tire, wishes them a safe journey and they are able to make it to New York. Tony invites Don to have dinner with his family, but Don declines. Sitting alone at home, he changes his mind and returns to Tony's, where he receives a surprisingly warm welcome by Tony's extended family. The end title cards show real-life photos of Don and Tony. It states that Don continued to tour and create music, while Tony went back to his work at the Copacabana, and that they remained friends until dying months apart in 2013.",

Her boss introduces her to Ivan \"Vanya\" Zakharov, the 21-year-old son of the Russian oligarch Nikolai Zakharov, who requests someone fluent in Russian. Though Vanya is in the U.S. to study, he spends most of his time partying in clubs and playing video games in his parents' lavish Brooklyn mansion. Vanya hires Anora for several sexual encounters. He invites her to a New Year's Eve party at the mansion, and the following day, he offers her $15,000 to be his girlfriend for a week. During the week, Anora parties with Vanya and his friends, and they all go on an extravagant trip to Las Vegas. At the end of the trip, Vanya reveals that he has to return to Russia permanently to work at his father's company and expresses disdain for his parents. He suggests that he will not have to leave if he marries an American and impulsively proposes marriage. Anora is reluctant at first but agrees after Vanya assures her that his feelings are genuine. They elope at a Vegas wedding chapel. Vanya then buys her a large wedding ring and an expensive fur coat. She resigns from her job and moves into Vanya's mansion. When news of their marriage reaches Russia, Vanya's mother, Galina, orders his Armenian godfather, Toros, to find them and arrange an annulment while she and his father, Nikolai, fly to the U.S. Toros sends his henchmen, Garnik and Igor, to the mansion. They inform Vanya that his parents are taking him back to Russia and enrage Anora by calling her a prostitute, suggesting Vanya only married her for a green card. Vanya flees the premises, and Anora engages in a violent struggle with Garnik and Igor before they restrain her. When Toros arrives, he tells Anora that Vanya's mansion and wealth belong to his parents and that he is immature and financially dependent on them. He confiscates her wedding ring, gags her, and offers her $10,000 for the annulment. Anora insists she and Vanya are in love, but she agrees to help find him. Anora, Toros, Garnik, and Igor search Brooklyn. Anora learns from friends that Vanya is at her former strip club, where he is being entertained by Diamond, a rival dancer. They drag Vanya out of the club, but he is too intoxicated to listen to them, and the group is forced to wait outside the courthouse overnight. The annulment is dismissed since the marriage took place in Nevada. At the airport, Anora introduces herself to Nikolai and Galina in Russian, but Galina rejects her. Conceding to his parents, Vanya coldly tells Anora their marriage must end while Galina orders everyone onto a plane to Las Vegas. Having not signed a prenuptial agreement, Anora pledges to file for a divorce settlement, but Galina threatens her with financial ruin if she does not comply. Realizing Vanya's cowardice and his family's power, Anora signs the annulment papers. Igor suggests Vanya apologize to Anora, but Galina objects. Anora insults both Vanya and Galina before leaving, telling Galina that Vanya only married her to spite her, much to Nikolai's amusement. Igor takes Anora back to New York to collect her belongings. At the mansion, she confronts Igor about their encounter, accusing him of assault and saying he would have raped her if they had been alone; Igor assures her he is simply not a rapist and had no intention of doing so. The next morning, Igor gives Anora the money Toros promised her and drives her home. In the car, he returns her wedding ring as a token of goodwill. Anora initiates sex with him but stops when he tries to kiss her; she breaks down and sobs in his arms.",

    "plot": "Lawyer Elliot Kintner and his teenage daughter Ridley are traveling in the Canadian Rockies for a weekend at the estate of Elliot's boss, Odell Leopold, and his family – his wife Belinda and son Shepard. On the way, Elliot accidentally strikes and injures a small unicorn with his car. When Ridley touches its horn, she experiences strange, cosmic visions, which Elliot abruptly stops by bludgeoning the creature with a tire iron, splashing blood on them both. The Kintners arrive at the Leopolds' estate with the unicorn's body hidden in their car. Shortly after, Ridley discovers that the unicorn's blood has cleaned away the acne on her face; Elliot's vision has also improved, and his allergies are gone. The Leopolds eventually discover the unicorn still alive in the car and their assistant Shaw shoots it. Upon learning the unicorn has magical healing properties, Odell suggests they experiment with it. A group of scientists working for the Leopolds, led by Dr. Song, create a concoction by grating off some of the unicorn's horn and injecting it intravenously into Odell, which cures his cancer. Odell orders the unicorn taken to their laboratory for further testing, planning to monetize its healing properties. Having read the story behind The Unicorn Tapestries, including a conjectured restoration of details missing from \"The Unicorn Surrenders to a Maiden\" tapestry, Ridley argues that the Leopolds should not be misusing the body of the unicorn, but they dismiss her concerns. As the unicorn is being transported to a laboratory, a much larger adult unicorn brutally kills Song and several security personnel but suddenly becomes passive when it meets Ridley. Shaw grazes it with a shotgun, causing it to flee and disappear into the woods. Odell organizes a hunting party and insists that Elliot join them. Shepard steals a vial of the unicorn's grated horn, which he snorts, and orders another scientist, Dr. Bhatia, to saw off the entire horn. Ridley realizes the unicorn is a foal and is still alive. Meanwhile, Elliot and the hunting party fall into a lethal trap and are ambushed by the larger unicorn and it's mate. Several people are killed, including Odell and Shaw. Elliot returns to the estate, where they realize the larger unicorns are the foal's parents. The group sends Bhatia to offer the foal back to the unicorns and Griff to unlock the gate. Upon realizing its horn is missing, the unicorns tear Bhatia apart while Griff flees. The unicorns follow the remaining four survivors into the estate. One unicorn finds and disembowels Belinda, while Shepard escapes. Elliot, having stolen the horn, lures the other unicorn outside so Ridley can escape. Ridley is caught and held at arrow-point by Shepard, having learned that unicorns are docile toward \"a pure-hearted maiden\" after experiencing visions from snorting the horn. The parent unicorns arrive and are immediately docile to Ridley. As Shepard ties up the unicorns' legs, Elliot stabs him with the horn, only to get stabbed back with an arrow. Shepard collapses and is fatally kicked by one of the unicorns. Ridley describes her visions to Elliot as he dies. Seeing Ridley mourning him, the unicorns magically revive Elliot and their foal and leave peacefully. Griff returns with the police, who, upon seeing the numerous dead bodies and the Kintner's bloody clothes, assume they are either witnesses or suspects and promptly arrest them. A female police officer tells her chief that they are bringing survivors and he would not be able to believe their story. As they are being driven away, the unicorns return as Griff allows them to pass by his car. They see that the Kintners are handcuffed in the back. As the Klinters put on their seatbelts and brace for impact, the unicorns ram the police car off a lakeside road. In the closing credits, the imagined details of the \"Maiden\" tapestry is again shown, revealing that it includes the Rockies, the cave the unicorns live in, some of the death scenes in the film, and also showing a unicorn ramming a carriage into a lake – with two occupants swimming away.",

They both mock each other initially, but spend a fun night together which involves Anna's first time in a pub. However, Jamie seemingly rejects her at the end of the night which leads to Anna deciding to make him jealous by dancing with another man. The next day Jamie shows her a special book, they reconcile, then are intimate, with both agreeing to keep things fun. Anna talks to Cecilia, a close friend of Jamie, who warns her away. Over the months, they become closer and finally Jamie invites Anna to his place. Jamie reveals that his brother Eddie passed away, and he and his father no longer talk. In the morning, Jamie appears distant. Anna attends the Oxford vs Cambridge boat race in London with her friends, but she has not seen Jamie for a week due to his studying. However, she finds out that he has not been at the library in weeks, and that Cecilia has also been busy for a week. Anna angrily goes to Jamie's place to confront him and finds Cecilia and Jamie, who appears to be sick and receiving medical treatment. He shouts at her to get out. Later, Jamie reveals the truth to Anna. Celia had been Eddie's girlfriend and he had died of an aggressive, genetic cancer, which is now afflicting Jamie. What Anna saw was his last treatment, as he refuses to do any more due to the pain, which is why his father is angry. Jamie insists Anna not waste her time on him, but she references one of their first conversations, saying he should not suffer alone. Jamie agrees to take Anna to the ball, where they meet his parents. Jamie's dad privately speaks with Anna, trying to get her to convince Jamie to return home for the best possible treatment.

    "title": "The Monkey",
    "plot": "In 1999, Petey Shelburn attempts to return a wind-up drum-playing toy monkey at an antiques shop. Before he can do so, the monkey plays its drums, triggering a chain reaction that ends with a harpoon gun disemboweling the shop owner. Shortly afterwards, Petey disappears, leaving his wife Lois to raise their twin sons Hal and Bill. The twins later discover the monkey among their father's belongings and wind its key. That evening, while they are at a hibachi restaurant, their babysitter Annie is accidentally decapitated by the chef. Bill's bullying of Hal prompts the latter to wind the monkey's key, hoping it will kill his brother. Instead, Lois suffers an aneurysm and dies in front of Bill. Hal disposes of the monkey before he and Bill move to Casco, Maine to live with their aunt Ida and uncle Chip. When the monkey mysteriously reappears at their new home, Bill winds its key, causing Chip to be trampled to death in a horse stampede. The twins seal the monkey in its box and throw it down a nearby well, hoping it will remain hidden. 25 years later, Hal, still paranoid and traumatized by his past, is estranged from his family, including his son Petey. His ex-wife, now remarried, plans to adopt Petey fully, effectively cutting Hal out of Petey's life. After Ida dies in a freak accident, Bill contacts Hal for the first time in five years, voicing his suspicion that the monkey has returned and insisting Hal drive to Ida's house to retrieve it. Hal believes it when a woman explodes after a motel pool is electrified. While inspecting Ida's house, her real estate agent Barbara reveals to Hal that, over the week following Ida's death, a series of bizarre fatal accidents have occurred in the town. A shotgun later falls out of a closet, killing Barbara. Hal and Petey soon learn that Bill lives in town and has the monkey, having hired a local named Ricky to retrieve it. Bill, who knows about Hal's attempt to use the monkey to kill him, has been turning the monkey's key in retaliation, though the monkey has only been killing random people. Hal implores Bill to stop, fearing for his son's safety. As whoever turns the key is spared, Bill says he will stop if Petey takes over the task of perpetually turning the key in his stead; if Hal refuses, Bill threatens to keep winding the key until Hal is killed, no matter who dies in the process. Ricky, obsessed with the monkey, forces Petey at gunpoint to retrieve it for him at Bill's house. Bill instructs Petey to wind the key, and a swarm of wasps kills Ricky. When Hal enters the house, Bill, furious at the sight of his brother still alive, forces the monkey to drum without winding the key in a desperate attempt to kill Hal. The monkey drums uncontrollably, triggering widespread death and destruction throughout the entire town. When Hal confronts Bill, the latter finally gives up, and the twins apologize to each other and reconcile over their shared grief for their mother. Shortly afterwards, the monkey beats its drums one last time, and Bill is suddenly decapitated by a bowling ball bearing Lois' name. Driving through the now-devastated town, Hal and Petey accept their fates as the monkey's owners and vow to prevent the key from ever being wound again. A pale black-eyed man riding a horse—implied to represent the Pale Horseman—passes by and acknowledges them. Hal, determined to reconnect with his son, suggests they go dancing, as it is something Lois had loved, and Petey accepts.",

    "plot": "In New York City, FBI agent brothers Marcus Anthony II and Kevin Copeland inadvertently ruin a drug bust. Their boss, Chief Elliott Gordon, offers them a reprieve if they safely escort sisters Brittany and Tiffany Wilson - the rich, shallow socialite daughters of Wilson Cruiseliners CEO Andrew Wilson, whom the police suspect will become the next victims in a string of high-profile kidnappings - to a weekend-long fashion event in the Hamptons. On the drive, the sisters' dog Baby leaps out of the car window, causing Kevin to lose control of the car. The sisters suffer minor facial cuts, but refuse to be seen with them. Kevin sends them into hiding and has a makeup expert friend create prosthetic disguises so he and Marcus can replace them. Kevin as Brittany and Marcus as Tiffany meet the sisters' three best friends – Lisa Anderson, Karen Googlestein, and Tori Wilson – and their rivals, Heather and Megan Vandergeld. Unbeknownst to Kevin and Marcus, they are being watched by Gordon, along with colleagues Vincent Gomez and Jake Harper, who are undercover posing as hotel staff. At the hotel, pro basketball player Latrell Spencer is attracted to Marcus/Tiffany, and Kevin sets his sights on New York One News reporter Denise Porter. At the Vandergelds' annual charity auction, Latrell wins a dinner date at a restaurant with Marcus/Tiffany. While Latrell takes Marcus/Tiffany to a restaurant, Kevin, believing Denise likes rich men, pretends to be Latrell and takes Latrell's car to drive Denise to Latrell's house. There, he hears about criminal Ted Burton turning the tables on Heather and Megan's father, Warren. With Kevin becoming romantically involved with Denise and Marcus/Tiffany unsuccessfully trying to reject Latrell, their combined antics put them under Gomez and Harper's suspicion. At a nightclub, after winning a dance-off against the Vandergelds, Kevin and Marcus learn from a drunken Karen that Warren is penniless and has been taking loans from her father. The brothers conclude that Warren is the mastermind behind the kidnappings. The next day, the real Brittany and Tiffany arrive at the hotel and discover they are being impersonated. They arrive in the Hamptons intent on exposing their \"clones\", as does Marcus' wife Gina, believing he is cheating on her. Realizing the Wilsons are being impersonated by men, Gomez and Harper aim to expose them, but accidentally strip down the real Brittany and Tiffany in front of Gordon. After Gomez and Harper are suspended, a furious Gordon fires Kevin and Marcus. Having lost both his job and possibly Gina, Marcus scolds Kevin for always dragging him into trouble. Later, Kevin and Marcus discover that Warren had embezzled money through his charity. Marcus convinces Kevin to not tell Gordon, to redeem themselves with Gomez and Harper's help. Again posing as the Wilsons, they are chosen for the final fashion show. The Vandergelds are furious that the Wilsons have replaced them on the catwalk, but the real Brittany and Tiffany also perform in the event. During the show, the Vandergeld sisters try to sabotage their \"rivals\", but end up being humiliated by Karen, Lisa, and Tori. The real Brittany and Tiffany appear and expose Kevin and Marcus, causing mass confusion. Warren begins the kidnapping, but incorrectly captures Marcus/Tiffany and Brittany. This begins a fight between the brothers and Heath and Russ, accomplices in the kidnappings. Warren soon captures the real sisters and explains his financial troubles to his wife and daughters, unaware that his confession is being filmed. In the ensuing scuffle, Kevin is nearly shot trying to protect Denise, Latrell is shot trying to protect Marcus/Tiffany, and Kevin shoots Warren in the shoulder. Marcus and Kevin capture Warren, while Gomez and Harper apprehend Heath and Russ. Afterward, their true identities are revealed. Latrell is dismayed that Marcus is not white, seemingly not bothered that he is a man. Warren, Heath, and Russ are arrested, while Gordon reinstates the brothers, Gomez, and Harper. Marcus reconciles with Gina, Kevin and Denise begin a relationship, and Latrell wins over the real Brittany and Tiffany. Tori, Lisa, and Karen admit they liked Brittany and Tiffany a lot more when Marcus and Kevin were them, and the five agree to remain friends and go shopping together.",

    "plot": "After the mining vessel Borealis is struck by an asteroid, asteroid miner Andy Ramirez wakes from cryogenic sleep only to experience emergency evacuation procedures. With his escape pod, and most others, hurtling toward a barren, alien planet, Andy lands largely unscathed, but soon begins to realize he's the only survivor. Accompanied by his suit's outdated AI assistant LEONARD, he scrambles to patch an oxygen breach from his suit, though his oxygen tank is already critically depleted. As Andy treks through the harsh landscape, he encounters Dwayne, a fellow survivor broadcasting a distress signal. Dwayne reveals that a rescue might take up to two years to arrive. Their brief interaction ends when Dwayne is suddenly snatched away by spider-like creatures while Andy isn't looking. Assuming Dwayne has left him for dead, Andy continues his journey to the crashed-remains of the Borealis. Soon after, Andy intercepts a distress broadcast from Naomi Calloway, trapped in an escape pod about 10 km away with a pinned leg. LEONARD, calculating the risk of reaching Naomi, advises Andy that the journey will consume a significant portion of his already-low oxygen. Andy presses on, driven by the hope of survival and connection with who he believes to be the only other survivor. The journey is filled with peril as Andy must evade numerous alien threats such as the spider-like predators and other bizarre creatures. Through radio exchanges, Andy reveals his personal trauma of losing his wife and son in a car accident while Naomi shares her own emotional struggles. Eventually, Andy reaches Naomi's pod and helps free her while she shares her oxygen with him. Together they fight off a creature attack to access the damaged Borealis. After closing the door, they realize they are not alone when a larger spider-like creature emerges from the dark and begins to pursue them. Accidentally locking themselves in an airlock, the spider-like creature begins to break through the door when Naomi finds a pouch of dangerous fireflies on Andy's backpack. She throws it at the creature, which frightens it away, giving them some time to run and find another door to the storage bay. When the creature follows them into the cargo bay, Naomi distracts it long enough for Andy to drop an escape pod onto it, crushing it. Although they cannot be rescued immediately, the pair find enough supplies for them to settle in and face a potential 18-month wait, but now with hope, companionship, and a renewed sense of emotional connection.",

Honey recognizes the dead driver as Mia Novotny, a prospective client who had asked to meet with her that day. Later Mr. Siegfried hires Honey to check whether his boyfriend is cheating. Honey visits her sister Heidi and her nieces and nephews, including rebellious teenager Corinne. Her police contact, MG Falcone, provides Mia's address. Honey speaks with Mia's parents, learning that she became a member of the Four-Way Temple led by Reverend Drew Devlin. Unbeknownst to his congregation, Drew is using his church to sell drugs. As he's having sex with a congregant, he's interrupted by his henchman Shuggie, who tells him one of their drivers overdosed on their drugs. Their liaison to their suppliers Chère—who removed a Temple ring from Mia's body before police arrived on the scene—warns Drew that Mia's death will bring unwanted attention to their operation, but he claims not to have been involved. Hector, one of Drew's dealers, panics when a customer is unable to pay, and propositions him instead. Hector fatally runs the man over while escaping. Drew sends Shuggie to tie up loose ends, but after he kills Hector's grandmother, Hector disarms and kills him. While Drew is in bed with more congregants, Hector ambushes him, but Drew evades and overpowers Hector before shooting him with his own gun. Honey learns that Mr. Siegfried's boyfriend was the man run over by Hector. She and MG have sex after a charged encounter in a bar. Corinne is beaten by her boyfriend, and goes to Honey's house for help, where she meets MG. Later Corinne is later stalked by an old man who tells her he loves her. Honey questions Drew, who defends his various suspicious contacts by his position as a minister. MG and Honey sleep together again, bonding over their childhood abuse as MG shares that her violent father was killed in combat overseas. Corinne is missing, and Honey brutally questions her boyfriend before she is approached by the old man—her and Heidi's estranged father—who attempts to reconnect. Honey fears that her niece is in danger of following Mia's path, and learns from Marty that Mia was stabbed to death before being placed in her car, and that the bodies of Shuggie and Hector's grandmother have been linked to the Temple. Chère has sex with Drew before terminating their partnership and murdering him in his bed. Honey sees her leaving, but Marty is unconvinced there is reason to search the Temple. Seeking help, Honey goes to MG's home, and finds that MG has kidnapped Corinne. MG stabs Honey, who is forced to kill her with her own service weapon before collapsing. Honey awakens in an ambulance, having been rescued alongside Corinne. MG is discovered to have been responsible for the unsolved murders of two sex workers and Mia, whose death she staged as a traffic fatality.

    "plot": "At the Coopers Chase retirement village, psychiatrist Ibrahim Arif, former trade union leader Ron Ritchie, and mysterious Elizabeth Best are members of the Thursday Murder Club (TMC), which meets weekly to discuss old cold cases. They are soon joined by Joyce, a retired nurse and new resident, whose medical knowledge proves useful. The group is inspired by a case once handled by Detective Inspector Penny Gray in 1973, now comatose in hospice, involving the unsolved murder of Angela Hughes. Police Constable Donna De Freitas, recently transferred from London, visits the village and strikes up a friendship with the TMC. She confides that her work feels tedious, so the club eagerly draws her into their investigations. Meanwhile, conflict brews over plans to redevelop Coopers Chase into luxury flats. One of the owners, Ian Ventham, pushes the project forward, while his partner Tony Curran opposes it, promising the residents that he will block the sale. Shortly afterwards, Tony is murdered in his own home, his house ransacked and the weapon missing. The TMC resolve to investigate. With Donna's help, they learn that local crime boss Bobby Tanner is secretly involved in the business but has long been thought to be dead after disappearing a few years earlier, and that Ron's son Jason once worked with Tony. Suspicion briefly falls on Ian, but he is soon ruled out. During a residents' protest, Ian himself collapses and dies from a fentanyl overdose, leaving Tanner the sole owner. Jason is arrested, though the evidence against him proves weak. Elizabeth develops a cautious friendship with Bogdan, a Polish handyman employed at the village. He discovers a hidden grave containing a skeleton, later identified as Peter Mercer, the man who witnessed Angela's death decades earlier. Elizabeth also begins receiving threats, warning her to leave the matter alone. When Jason provides an alibi (an affair with Ian's estranged wife Gemma), the TMC turn their attention back to Tanner. Elizabeth and Donna discover that he has been trafficking migrants and seizing their passports, and, to their shock, Tony was his partner. Elizabeth confronts him and strikes a bargain: he is to keep Coopers Chase intact in return for her silence. She then realises that Bogdan was responsible for Tony's death. At the same time, Bogdan, while playing chess with Elizabeth's husband Stephen, confesses after pressed that he killed Tony under pressure but unintentionally. His confession is secretly, and accidentally, recorded by Stephen, and he is arrested. He reveals he merely wanted his passport back so he could return to Poland to his sick mother. The truth about Angela's murder also emerges. The TMC deduce that Mercer killed her, but that Penny secretly took justice into her own hands by killing Mercer and concealing his body. As Ian's plans to redevelop Coopers Chase might have revealed Mercer's body, thereby implicating Penny, her husband John murdered him to protect her. Both Penny and John die soon after in hospice care (implied to be a murder–suicide from fentanyl overdosing). At their funeral, Elizabeth presents Penny's club necklace to Joyce, formally welcoming her as a full member of the TMC. With Coopers Chase once more up for sale, Joyce's daughter Joanna considers buying it. Life in the village quietly resumes, with friendships renewed and the club ready for whatever mystery may come next.",

When she returns to the apartment, she overhears Ben insulting her while talking to his friend Pete. Not realizing that he is incredibly hurt by her disappearance, Bea leaves. Bea and Ben cross paths again six months later when Bea's sister Halle begins dating Pete's sister Claudia. The two are frosty with each other, each blaming the other for their date ending poorly. Halle and Claudia eventually get engaged and plan their wedding in Sydney. Bea, who has broken up with her fiancé Jonathan and secretly dropped out of law school, is dismayed to find that she and Ben are on the same flight to Sydney and that both will be staying at Claudia and Pete's parents' house in the days leading up to the wedding. Their disdain for each other frustrates the other members of the wedding party, compounded by the appearances of both Bea's and Ben's exes, Jonathan and Margaret, respectively. The attendees devise a plan to get Bea and Ben together to ensure the wedding goes smoothly. Bea sees through the scheme and makes a deal with Ben to pretend that they are together in order to both make Margaret jealous and stop Bea's parents pushing her to reconcile with Jonathan. They attempt to sell the relationship with public displays of affection. During a party on a boat, Bea and Ben dance together and reenact a scene from Titanic, which ends with Bea falling into Sydney Harbour. Ben jumps in after her; while waiting for rescue on a buoy, she tells him that she has withdrawn from law school. They explain to each other what happened the morning after they met, and make a date to sightsee at the Sydney Opera House. The pair return to the house and have sex. Then, Bea suggests offhandedly that her recent actions have all been mistakes, which disappoints Ben. He leaves her while she is sleeping, disheartening Bea. The morning of the wedding, Ben indirectly reveals to Bea's parents that she has quit law school, leaving her feeling betrayed. They tell the others that they were only pretending to be together. After overhearing Halle and Claudia arguing, Ben convinces Bea to pretend to reconcile for the sake of the wedding. The ceremony goes smoothly, but Bea sees Margaret kissing Ben so leaves in tears, quietly heading to the Opera House. However, he rejects Margaret, unbeknownst to Bea, declaring he no longer has feelings for her. The wedding guests convince Ben to chase after Bea, so he jumps off a cliff into the Pacific Ocean, then asks the rescue helicopter to fly him to the Opera House. Ben tells Bea that he left because he feared their relationship could become another regret; Bea in turn tells him that spending the night with him was the first thing she has not regretted in a long time.

Godwin reveals that her body is that of a woman who was pregnant and died by suicide by leaping off Tower Bridge; Godwin replaced the woman's brain with that of the fetus, giving her an infant's mind, and named her Bella Baxter. As weeks pass, Bella's vocabulary improves and she exhibits childlike wonder at the world. With Godwin's encouragement, Max falls in love with Bella and proposes marriage. Bella accepts, but soon discovers masturbation and sexual pleasure, leading her to run off with Duncan Wedderburn, a debauched lawyer, to Lisbon. There, they have near-constant intercourse because Bella has no understanding of anything beyond physical pleasure. She is mistakenly addressed as \"Victoria Blessington\" by a fellow hotel guest. As Bella becomes difficult for Duncan to control, he smuggles her onto a cruise ship, where she befriends two passengers who open her mind to philosophy. Duncan attempts to further stunt her growth to no avail, and indulges in drinking and gambling. During a stop at Alexandria, Bella witnesses the suffering of the poor and becomes distraught. Wishing to help them, she entrusts Duncan's winnings to unscrupulous members of the crew, who falsely promise to give it to them. Unable to afford the rest of the trip, Bella and Duncan are dropped off at Marseille and make their way to Paris, penniless. Seeking money and accommodation, Bella is coerced into working at a brothel. Enraged, Duncan breaks down, and Bella abandons him. At the brothel, she comes under the tutelage of Madame Swiney and begins a relationship with fellow prostitute Toinette, who introduces her to socialism. Now terminally ill, Godwin asks Max to bring Bella to him. Max finds her after tracking down Duncan, who has been institutionalised. Back in London, Bella reconciles with Godwin and renews her plans to marry Max, but their wedding is interrupted by Duncan and General Alfie Blessington. Alfie, addressing Bella as Victoria, declares that they were married before her disappearance and that he has come to reclaim her. Bella leaves Max to learn of her past life, but is exposed to Alfie's violent and sadistic nature. Bella partially realises that she was Victoria, and that she killed herself to escape Alfie. Alfie confines Bella to his mansion and tells her that he plans to have her clitoris removed and impregnate her, threatening her with a gun and demanding she drink a sedative. She tosses the sedative in his face. Alfie accidentally shoots himself in the foot and passes out. Bella returns to Godwin's house and, with Max's help, transplants a goat's brain into Alfie's head. Godwin dies peacefully with Bella and Max at his side. Bella, Max, and Toinette begin a new life in Godwin's house, while Alfie eats grass happily.",

    "plot": "In late 1941, during World War II, the United Kingdom struggles to halt Nazi Germany's attempts to take over Europe, with London regularly bombed by the Luftwaffe and supply and aid ships constantly sunk by German submarines. Brigadier Colin Gubbins initiates Operation Postmaster, a covert sabotage mission to disrupt U-boat resupply operations on Spanish-controlled Fernando Po. SOE agents Marjorie Stewart and Richard Heron depart by train while Gubbins enlists Gus March-Phillipps to assemble a ground team to destroy the Italian supply ship Duchessa d'Aosta and two tugboats. Gus and his allies Henry Hayes, Freddy Alvarez, and Danish Army officer Anders Lassen sail to Fernando Po on the neutral Swedish fishing trawler Maid of Honor. They divert to a German-controlled section of La Palma to rescue SOE saboteur Geoffrey Appleyard from the Gestapo. Gubbins had sent Appleyard ahead hoping Gus would want him on the team. Marjorie and Heron use an 'illegal' gambling hall on Fernando Po to recruit backup for Gus's team. Marjorie seduces Heinrich Luhr, the SS commander in charge. Learning that the Duchessa intends to depart three days early, Gus sails through a British naval blockade of Nazi-occupied West Africa knowing they'll be arrested if their unauthorised mission is discovered. Marjorie and Heron learn that Luhr has had the Duchessa's hull reinforced despite the Italian attache's reservations. Gus and Appleyard decide their best course of action is to hijack the ships and use them for barter after a mole in Gubbins's staff reveals the mission to senior command. Luhr catches on when Marjorie's act begins to 'slip' but the raid is successful, and Marjorie shoots Luhr in the head. Delivering the boats to a British fleet outside Lagos, the team is arrested. They are spared court-martial when Winston Churchill adds them to his 'Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare'. A montage before the end credits reveal the later activities of several protagonists: Gus became a war hero helming similar raids and married Marjorie at the start of her acting career; Appleyard received commendations for his role in the mission, much to the king's amusement; Hayes became an accomplished spy notable for surviving a year of Nazi torture; Lassen took part in raids outside the group until his death in 1945; Ian Fleming, part of Gubbins's inner circle, used Operation Postmaster as inspiration for his James Bond novels.",

    "plot": "In late May 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mayor Ted Garcia of Eddington, New Mexico, implements a lockdown and enforces mask mandates based on the Governor's orders at the state level. Local sheriff Joe Cross disapproves, arguing the mandates violate freedom of choice. Joe lives with his emotionally unstable wife, Louise, and her conspiracy-theorist mother, Dawn. After confrontations with Ted, who is running for re-election with a tech-friendly campaign that would allow building a data center, Joe decides to run against him, much to the reclusive Louise's disapproval. He recruits officers Guy and Michael as campaign aides. Louise and Dawn invite radical cult leader Vernon Jefferson Peak for dinner, and during a discussion about their conspiratorial beliefs about pedophilia and child trafficking, Louise hints that her father abused her. Joe expresses disbelief in Vernon’s professed backstory, which is based on recovered memories. Meanwhile, Ted's son Eric gets involved in Black Lives Matter protests with his friend Brian and social justice-minded Sarah. Sarah unsuccessfully tries to persuade Michael to join their cause. To sway the election in his favor, Joe claims during a campaign event that Ted sexually assaulted Louise. She leaves town with Vernon after denying the allegations in an online video. The next day, Joe confronts Ted under the pretext of a noise complaint at his residence during a fundraiser. Ted slaps Joe in front of campaign fundraiser guests. That evening, in a fugue state, Joe shoots a vagrant dead and dumps his body in a nearby river. He next shoots Ted and Eric in their home with a sniper rifle and stages the scene as an Antifa attack. Meanwhile, a mysterious private jet carrying heavily armed terrorists heads toward Eddington. Officer Butterfly Jimenez of the Pueblo tribe gets involved in the investigation of deaths since Joe shot his rifle on Pueblo land. Joe frames Michael as the killer and jails him to divert attention, but Butterfly makes connections pointing to the sheriff. Eddington is attacked by the terrorists, who kidnap Michael and set several fires. Joe and Guy find Michael in the desert, where he tries to warn them not to get close. An explosive detonates when the officers approach, killing Guy and severely wounding Michael. Joe heads back to Eddington, where he is targeted by snipers. After evading them in the desert and his home, he breaks into a gun store to arm himself. He fires his weapons haphazardly, accidentally shooting Butterfly's leg off before one of the snipers kills him. Joe is eventually cornered and stabbed in the head by a terrorist, causing significant brain damage. He is saved by Brian, who guns down Joe’s attacker while filming on his phone.

    "title": "Happy Gilmore 2",
    "plot": "After winning his first Tour Championship in 1996, Happy Gilmore has a successful golf career, winning five more championships. He also has five children with his wife Virginia Venit, the professional golf tour's public relations director. After accidentally killing Virginia in 2014 when one of his drives hits her in the head, Happy feels devastated and quits golf out of guilt. He soon becomes an alcoholic and loses everything after a repossession worker sues him for instigating a brawl when mistaking the worker for a car thief. Eleven years later, Happy works at a supermarket and lives with his only daughter and youngest child Vienna, while his four sons—Gordie, Wayne, Bobby, and Terry—have all moved out and are working to support their father and sister. Vienna wants to pursue dancing, and her dance teacher recommends enrolling in a four-year ballet school in Paris, which costs $75,000 annually. Frank Manatee, CEO of Maxi Energy Drink and the upcoming golf league Maxi Golf, later approaches Happy and wants him to be the league's star. Happy refuses but resumes playing golf with encouragement from John Daly, wanting to win enough money to put Vienna through ballet school. During his first round since Virginia died, Happy drinks heavily and crashes his golf cart, which gets him fired from his job and in legal trouble. A jury agrees to remove all charges if he completes an alcohol treatment program and refrains from any physical altercations. This treatment program's leader turns out to be Hal L., the caretaker who forced Happy's grandmother into sweat shop labor. Vienna and John advise Happy to practice seriously and to join the next Tour Championship, which he does. One month later, Happy meets old companions, including Doug Thompson, president of the Tour, who worries about Maxi Golf rising fast. After Happy suggests having a competition between the two leagues, Doug proposes a match with the five best players from each league competing against each other. Happy, with help from his new caddie, Oscar Mejías, plays well at the Tour Championship in the first three rounds, but collapses in the fourth round on Mother's Day, seeing visions of Virginia on the course before getting drunk, finishing sixth. The winner, Billy Jenkins, admits to being in Maxi Golf, having participated in the Tour Championship as a taunt, vacating his place on the team and enabling Happy to join. Having been in psychiatric care since losing to Happy at the 1996 Tour Championship, Shooter McGavin is granted a release by Frank. He explains to Shooter that all players on Maxi Golf, including Billy, have their iliolumbar ligament severed, increasing their driving distance, and asks him to join as their captain. Disgusted with this and how Frank's \"extreme\" version of golf highly strays from the traditional game, Shooter escapes. Having heard about Virginia's death, Shooter visits her grave and briefly fights Happy there before they call a truce. Happy later meets Slim Peterson, whose father Chubbs Peterson had mentored Happy in 1996, and Slim joins Shooter in coaching Happy, Rory McIlroy, Bryson DeChambeau, Brooks Koepka and Scottie Scheffler to face Maxi Golf. During the match, Scottie gets disqualified in the first round for punching his opponent. Although the course is heavily designed to advantage Maxi Golf, as all their golfers are long drivers, the traditional golfers manage to make it 2-2, with the help of Shooter, who replaces Brooks after he gets injured. Happy and Billy then face off in a tie-breaker. Happy has a chance to putt for victory, but Frank alters the green to make it impossible to putt. He then makes a deal with Happy: if Happy misses the putt, Happy must join Maxi Golf. Otherwise, Frank must discontinue Maxi Golf, buy Happy's house back, pay for Vienna's ballet school, give Happy his new electric car, and open a new Italian restaurant for Oscar. With help from the lattermost, Happy sinks the putt and wins. When Happy celebrates his three-month sobriety, Hal is exposed as a con artist and gets arrested. Maxi Energy Drink is discontinued after being revealed to cause significant oral health issues, leaving Frank in ruin and in hiding. Happy later accompanies his kids at an airport as they fly off to Paris, promising to join them after completing the British Open, but is forced to walk when he forgot to charge the electric car.",

    "title": "Hocus Pocus",
    "plot": "On October 31, 1693, in Salem, Massachusetts, Thackery Binx discovers that his younger sister Emily has been kidnapped by the three witches Winifred, Mary and Sarah Sanderson. Binx confronts the Sanderson sisters at their cottage, but not in time to save Emily, whose life force they have drained to keep themselves young. The witches punish Binx for interfering by turning him into an immortal black cat, so he must live forever with his guilt. Binx's friend Elijah rallies the townsfolk to arrest the Sandersons; they are condemned to death, but Winifred casts a curse during the hanging, claiming that a virgin will light the Black-Flame Candle in the cottage on a day when the full moon and All Hallows' Eve coincide, resurrecting the sisters. Binx decides to try to thwart the witches' plans. Three centuries later, Max Dennison, who has recently moved to Salem from Los Angeles, reluctantly takes his younger sister Dani out trick-or-treating. They meet up with his new classmate Allison Watts, whom he has a crush on. Max, Dani and Allison visit the former Sanderson cottage, now an abandoned museum, where Max inadvertently resurrects the witches by lighting the Black-Flame Candle. The witches attempt to suck out Dani's soul, but Max intervenes. Binx arrives and reveals that he can talk; following Binx's instructions, Max steals Winifred's spellbook and the children flee to a cemetery, which the witches cannot step into as it is hallowed ground. From a distance, Winifred raises her former fiancé, Billy Butcherson, from his grave and sends him after the children, forcing them to leave the cemetery. Winifred also reveals to her sisters that, unless they can suck the life out of at least one child, the three of them will turn to dust when the sun rises. Max, Dani, and Allison hurry to a Halloween party that most of the town's adults are attending. Max tries to warn his parents and the other adults of the danger, but the witches take the stage and use a performance of \"I Put a Spell on You\" to enchant the partying adults to dance until they die. Binx and the three children then lure the witches into the local high school's pottery kiln and burn them alive; the witches temporarily disintegrate, but the curse revives them after the children have gone. Not realizing that the witches have survived, Max and Allison open the spellbook, hoping to reverse the curse on Binx. This action allows the witches to find the children, abduct Binx and Dani, and retrieve the spellbook. Sarah uses her singing to lure all of Salem's children to the Sanderson cottage; however, Max and Allison rescue Dani and Binx by briefly tricking the witches into believing that the sun has risen an hour early. Back at the cemetery, Billy catches up to the children, cuts open his stitched mouth with Max's knife, and reveals that he hates Winifred and is on their side. The witches snatch Dani back after attacking the children from the air, and Winifred attempts to use their last vial of potion to suck out Dani's life force. Binx attacks Winifred to make her drop the potion, resulting in her throwing him to the ground and mortally wounding him. Max catches and drinks the potion to save Dani. Winifred takes Max on her broomstick to suck out his life force, and the two of them fight in mid-air. The rest of the party fend off Mary and Sarah, while Max and Winifred fall off the broom into the hallowed ground of the cemetery, causing Winifred to turn into stone. The sun rises, turning Mary and Sarah into dust, with Winifred's stone body also exploding into dust shortly after. With the witches vanquished, Billy gratefully returns to his grave and passes away. Dani discovers the body of Binx and begins to weep, but his spirit, now free and returned to human form due to the curse being broken, thanks the children. Emily's spirit then appears to escort her brother to the afterlife. In a mid-credits scene, the enchanted adults are freed from the spell and leave the Halloween party, exhausted from dancing all night. Some bullies that were earlier trapped in the Sanderson museum still wait in a cage to be freed, while the living eye on the witches' spellbook opens and looks around, suggesting the Sanderson Sisters may return.",

    "title": "Bullet Train",
    "plot": "Yuichi Kimura, \"the Father\", boards a bullet train in Tokyo in search of the person who pushed his young son, Wataru, off the roof of a building, leaving the boy comatose. Meanwhile, guided by his handler Maria Beetle, operative \"Ladybug\" is assigned to retrieve a briefcase full of cash from the same train, replacing a sick colleague, Carver. Ladybug is reluctant, as his recent string of bad luck during his jobs resulted in accidental deaths. Also on the train are two British assassin brothers, codenamed \"Lemon\" and \"Tangerine\", who just rescued a man (\"the Son\") from kidnappers and are taking him and the briefcase to his father, a Russian-born Yakuza crime lord called \"the White Death\". During the trip, the Son is killed by poisoning. Ladybug discreetly steals the briefcase, but on his way off the train, is attacked by the assassin codenamed \"the Wolf\", who recognizes Ladybug from his wedding, where his wife was killed. The Wolf mistakenly believes Ladybug to be one of her killers, but during their altercation, he is accidentally killed with his own knife. Yuichi determines who pushed Wataru, a young woman codenamed \"the Prince\", but she outsmarts him. She lured him onto the train as part of a plan to have him kill his boss, the White Death. To ensure Yuichi's cooperation, she has a henchman holding Wataru hostage in the hospital. Recognizing Lemon from a job in Johannesburg gone wrong, Ladybug offers to return the case in exchange for being allowed to leave. Lemon suspects that he killed the Son, leading to a fight during which Lemon is knocked unconscious, and Ladybug spikes his water with sleeping powder. Tangerine wakes Lemon and they both split off to find Ladybug and frame him for the Son's murder. The Prince finds the briefcase, booby-traps it with explosives, and rigs Yuichi's gun to explode if fired. Ladybug encounters Tangerine and, after avoiding the White Death's men, kicks him off the train as it departs, but he manages to climb back aboard from outside. Suspicious of the two, Lemon shoots Yuichi and is about to shoot the Prince, but collapses after drinking the spiked water. The Prince shoots Lemon and conceals him and Yuichi in a bathroom. Ladybug encounters the assassin \"the Hornet\", who poisoned both the Wolf's wedding party and the Son with boomslang snake venom. After a struggle, both are exposed to the venom, but Ladybug takes the Hornet's antivenom before she can, killing her. Tangerine runs into the Prince and notices one of Lemon's train stickers on her, realizing that she shot Lemon. Ladybug interrupts them and kills Tangerine before he can shoot the Prince. At the next stop, Yuichi's father, \"the Elder\", boards the train. He recognizes the Prince's voice and informs her that Wataru is safe as her henchman has been killed. After she flees, the Elder tells Ladybug he will remain to confront the White Death, who killed his wife while taking over the yakuza. Finding Yuichi and Lemon still alive, the four work together and prepare to face the White Death. At Kyoto, Ladybug gives the White Death the briefcase. The Prince, revealed to be the White Death's daughter, fails to goad him into shooting her with the rigged gun. The White Death explains that each of the assassins, as well as the Son, were linked to the death of his wife. He hired them hoping they would kill each other, not knowing Carver (his wife's killer) was replaced by Ladybug. The White Death's henchmen open the briefcase, which explodes, knocking Ladybug and the White Death back onto the train. The White Death's remaining henchmen board and battle the assassins, while the Elder duels the White Death. The train crashes into downtown Kyoto. Emerging from the wreck, impaled with the Elder's katana, the White Death tries to kill Ladybug, but the Prince's rigged gun explodes in his face. The Prince threatens Ladybug, Yuichi, and the Elder with a machine gun but is run over by a truck full of tangerines driven by Lemon. Maria arrives to retrieve Ladybug, while Japanese authorities begin to clean up the damage caused by the train crash.",

    "title": "The Truman Show",
    "plot": "Selected at birth and legally adopted by a television studio following an unwanted pregnancy, Truman Burbank is the unsuspecting star of The Truman Show, a reality television program filmed and broadcast worldwide, 24/7, through hidden cameras. Truman's hometown, Seahaven Island, is set inside an enormous soundstage in Los Angeles, which allows Christof, the show's creator and executive producer, to control most aspects of Truman's life. Truman's world is populated by actors and crew members who serve as his community while keeping him from discovering the truth. To prevent Truman from escaping, Christof has orchestrated various scenarios, such as the \"death\" of Truman's father in a boating accident to instill fear of the sea, and has the cast reinforce Truman's anxieties with messages about the dangers of traveling and the virtues of staying home. Though the producers intend for Truman to fall in love with and marry a woman named Meryl, he develops feelings for Sylvia, an extra. Sympathetic to Truman's plight, she tries to tell him the truth but is fired and removed from the set. Truman marries Meryl, but their relationship is stilted and passionless, and he imagines a life with Sylvia and dreams of traveling to Fiji, where he was told she had moved. Meanwhile, in the real world, Sylvia joins \"Free Truman\", an activist group that calls for Truman's liberation. As the show approaches its thirtieth anniversary, Truman notices unusual occurrences, such as a stage light falling from the sky, an isolated patch of rain that falls only over him, a radio transmission describing his movements, and the reappearance of his father, who is rushed away by crew members before Truman can confront him. Inferring that the city revolves around him, Truman questions his life and asks his closest confidants to help him solve the mystery. Truman's suspicions culminate in an attempt to escape the island, but increasingly implausible occurrences block his path. Eventually, he is caught and returned home under a flimsy pretext. There, he confronts Meryl and challenges the sincerity of their marriage. As he holds her hostage, Meryl breaks character to call for help and is removed from the show. Hoping to bring Truman back to a controllable state, Christof reintroduces his father to the show under the guise of him having developed amnesia following the accident. The show regains its ratings, and Truman seems to return to his routines. One night, however, Christof discovers that Truman has begun sleeping in his basement. Disturbed by this change in behavior, Christof sends Truman's best friend Marlon to visit and discovers that Truman has disappeared through a makeshift tunnel in the basement. Christof suspends the broadcast for the first time in its history, leading to record viewing numbers. Truman is found sailing away from Seahaven, having conquered his fear of water. Christof resumes the transmission and creates a violent storm in an attempt to capsize Truman's boat. Truman nearly drowns but continues to sail until his boat strikes the wall of the soundstage. There he finds a staircase leading to an exit door. As he contemplates leaving, Christof speaks to Truman, revealing the truth about the show and encouraging him to stay by claiming that there is no more truth in the real world than in his artificial one. Truman utters his catchphrase – \"In case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night\" – before bowing to the audience and exiting. Viewers around the world celebrate Truman's escape, and Sylvia races to greet him. The executive producers end the program with a shot of the open exit door, leaving Christof devastated. After the broadcast ends, Truman's viewers look for something else to watch.",

    "plot": "In 1760, a young Barnabas Collins and his wealthy family immigrated from Liverpool to Maine, where they established the town of Collinsport and constructed the Collinwood Mansion. Fifteen years later, Barnabas is engaged to Josette while having an affair with Angelique, who is secretly a witch, but he refuses any further advances. Enraged, Angelique murders his parents using magic and curses Barnabas. She then casts a spell on Josette, making her jump to her death from the cliff called Widows' Hill. A distraught Barnabas attempts to fall to his death but fails, discovering that Angelique's curse has transformed him into a vampire. She rallies the town against him, and Barnabas is buried alive in a hidden tomb. In 1972, Maggie Evans, under the alias Victoria Winters, is hired as governess for the Collins family, now consisting of matriarch Elizabeth; her teenage daughter Carolyn; Elizabeth's brother Roger, and his young son David, who believes he is being visited by his late mother's ghost; and a live-in alcoholic psychiatrist, Dr. Julia Hoffman. Meanwhile, a construction crew unwittingly frees Barnabas from his tomb and he drinks their blood to restore himself. At Collinwood, Barnabas hypnotizes the caretaker, Willie, to become his familiar, and reveals to Elizabeth that the family curse is true. He asks to rejoin the family and shows her the manor's secret passages and hidden treasure. Meanwhile, an older Angelique has displaced the Collins family fishing business by starting her own company, Angel Bay Seafood. Once discovering that Barnabas has escaped, she goes to Collinwood to confront him, reminding him of her powers and popularity within the town before she leaves. While adjusting to modern life and falling for Victoria, Barnabas uses his powers and the family treasure to restore his family's finances. Dr. Hoffman learns of his true nature while he is under hypnosis and offers to try to turn him mortal by removing his corrupted blood and giving him transfusions of human blood. Angelique arranges another meeting with Barnabas. She begs him to love her back, but after having supernatural intercourse with her, he refuses. She vows to destroy his family and Victoria. Barnabas hosts a \"happening\" at Collinwood for the entire town. He talks with Victoria, who reveals she has been seeing Josette's ghost her whole life. Her parents committed her to an asylum for it. However, she eventually escaped, and Josette directed her to Collinwood. Determined to be human again, Barnabas goes to Dr. Hoffman's office, where he discovers that she deceived him to turn herself into a vampire and avoid death from old age. Barnabas kills her, and he and Willie dump her body at sea. After catching Roger attempting to break into the secret passage that leads to the hidden fortune, Barnabas confronts him, offering him a choice: become a better father or leave Collinwood with financial gain; Roger chooses the latter. Heartbroken, David is nearly struck by a falling disco ball, but Barnabas saves him before catching fire in the daylight, revealing himself as a vampire to the whole family and Victoria. Believing they will never accept him, Barnabas meets with Angelique, who goads him into confessing to his murders and demands he join her as her paramour. He refuses, so she again traps him in a coffin. Angelique destroys the Collins' cannery and, with a recording of Barnabas' confession, rallies the town to storm Collinwood Manor. David frees Barnabas, who confronts Angelique at Collinwood. They battle, and the townspeople learn that she is a witch. Carolyn, who is revealed to be a werewolf, joins the fight, and Angelique uses her enchantments to subdue them, damage the house and start fires. Angelique admits she was responsible for the werewolf that bit Carolyn as an infant and for the death of David's mother. Her ghost appears and incapacitates the witch, and the family escapes the burning manor. Angelique offers Barnabas her heart, but he refuses; she then crumbles into dust. Barnabas races to Widows' Hill and finds Victoria, who says she has to be a vampire if they are to be together. When he refuses, she falls off the cliff. Barnabas leaps after her, biting her neck. Now a vampire, she awakens as Josette, with his curse lifted. Meanwhile, Dr. Hoffman, bound and on the sea floor, is resurrected by Barnabas' blood and becomes a vampire.",

    "title": "Ghosted",
    "plot": "At a Washington, D.C. farmers' market, Sadie Rhodes, a lonely professional who travels often, meets Cole Turner, a romantic agricultural author. They share an enjoyable all-night date, culminating in sex, and he returns home but his texts to her go unanswered. Cole's sister suspects she is \"ghosting\" him, but their parents convince Cole to surprise Sadie in London, after locating her via a tracker on his inhaler he accidentally left in her bag. In London, Cole is abducted to Pakistan by arms dealers who believe he is legendary CIA operative \"the Taxman\". Before he can be tortured with insects to extract a passcode, he is rescued by Sadie, who reveals herself to be the Taxman. After a chase through the Khyber Pass, they escape Cole's captors, who are working for Leveque, a disgraced French Intelligence agent selling a stolen bioweapon called \"Aztec\", which he needs the passcode to access. Reaching a nearby town, Cole and Sadie argue over their lies to each other, and meet Marco, her old contact and former lover. He warns Cole that Sadie cares more about the success of a mission than her boyfriends' lives, showing him his missing hand, and agrees to take him home. Their plan is interrupted by a succession of bounty hunters after Leveque puts a price on Cole's head; Marco is killed, but the bounty hunters all kill each other. Learning that Leveque is seeking the passcode, Sadie is determined to recover Aztec using Cole as bait. Sadie delivers Cole to Leveque, who leaves his henchman Wagner on a plane with Sadie, Cole, and the locked case containing Aztec. Sadie and Cole's cover is blown when Wagner discovers a picture of the two in bed together on Cole's phone, but Cole parachutes to safety with the Aztec case and a wounded Sadie. Landing on Socotra Island, he uses his agricultural knowledge to treat her, and she is impressed both by his recovery of the Aztec case and his resourcefulness. They are ambushed by Leveque's men, and Wagner escapes with the case while Cole and Sadie are rescued by U.S. Marines. At CIA headquarters, Sadie and Cole take a lie-detector test where Cole satisfies the agents that he is a civilian but is hurt by the revelation that Sadie believes that she should have sacrificed him for the mission. Sadie is suspended for losing Aztec and the agency briefly tries to turn Cole against her; however, he deduces the passcode after seeing an unusual crop in the photos from Sadie's mission reports. With this new leverage, the agency convinces Cole to resume masquerading as the Taxman, luring Leveque with an offer to sell the code. Leveque meets Cole at a revolving restaurant with interested buyer for Aztec, Mr. Utami, and has the agents monitoring Cole killed. Sadie arrives, restoring Cole's trust in her, and she sells the passcode to Mr. Utami for $10 million. She immediately uses the money to place a bounty on Leveque, and they are suddenly surrounded by bounty hunters. A gunfight erupts. Cole and Sadie fight their way through the bounty hunters and Utami's bodyguards by working together. While inexperienced, Cole proves to have excellent instincts during the fight, supporting Sadie by throwing opponents to the ground and using a shotgun to provide cover; however, Wagner pulls Cole into the mechanical room where their one-on-one fight damages the restaurant's revolving mechanism. Leveque shoots Utami, and Cole kills Wagner by throwing him into the mechanism. Returning, Cole assists Sadie pursuing Leveque against the walls of the restaurant as its speed increases. Sadie manages to send Leveque crashing through a window to his death and narrowly saves the Aztec device while using Cole as an anchor. Rekindling their relationship, Sadie meets Cole's family. The two reveal they are now traveling together while Cole conducts his research and Sadie \"hunts down\" her clients, allowing them to make time for each other.",

    "title": "Totally Killer",
    "plot": "In the small town of Vernon, on October 27, 29, and 31, 1987, three teenage girls named Tiffany Clark, Marisa Song, and Heather Hernandez were killed by the Sweet 16 Killer, each having been stabbed 16 times on the nights of their 16th birthdays. In the present day of 2023, teenager Jamie Hughes goes to a concert with her friend Amelia on Halloween night while her mother, Pam, stays at home. Pam used to be friends with the three victims of the Sweet 16 Killer, and while handing out candy, she is attacked by the killer, who stabs her to death. As Jamie grieves Pam's death, she helps Amelia put the finishing touches on a time machine she created for a school project and is approached by reporter Chris Dubasage, who tells her that Pam received a note from the killer that she kept secret: \"You're next, one day.\" At night, Jamie is chased by the killer and hides in the time machine, which activates and sends her back to 1987. She realizes that if she stops the Sweet 16 Killer's original spree, she can save Pam's life. Jamie, masquerading as an exchange student from Canada, discovers that Pam and her friends were despised by everyone in the town as they were bullies. Jamie manages to convince Amelia's mother, Lauren, and a teenager named Doug, her school's present-day principal, to help her. Although Jamie manages to infiltrate a party hosted by Tiffany, she is unable to stop her murder. Using the trauma to bond with Pam, she infiltrates their group and convinces them to leave for the weekend, although this backfires; they end up at the cabin where Marisa was killed in the original timeline. As Jamie works to protect Marisa, Heather is murdered instead, changing the timeline. On Halloween night, the group reconvenes at the amusement park while Lauren works on turning a popular attraction into a makeshift time machine for Jamie to travel forward. In the present, Chris helps Amelia fix their time machine as they realize the timeline is changing. The group lures the Sweet 16 Killer into a haunted house where he attacks them, only to be impaled by Kara, the future town sheriff, with a scythe. Doug is revealed as the killer, seeking revenge on the group for the death of his girlfriend Trish. Marisa reveals that she, Tiffany, and Heather got Trish drunk one night and let her drive home, with her dying in an accident; Pam, however, was not present. As Jamie wonders why Pam received the note, a second killer appears and slits Marisa's throat. The second killer chases after Jamie, killing Chris' father along the way. The two face off in the new time machine as it activates, and the killer is revealed to be Chris from the present. Doug was the original killer, but Chris murdered Pam and forged the note in order to generate more content for his podcast. The two fight and Jamie kicks him into the spinning machine, killing him. Upon returning to the present day, she finds that Pam is still alive. However, Jamie's intervention in the past has resulted in an alternate future in which her parents got together earlier than they had originally. Consequently, she now has an older brother named Jamie and her name is now Colette. Lauren then gives her a notebook detailing everything that had changed from her intervention: Lauren and Pam became best friends; her new brother has a husband and a three-year-old daughter; Randy, her old coach, is now the school principal; Kara became chief of police, whose weed brownies have become well renown; Damon (aka 'Lurch'), the groundskeeper, started a video game company and anti-bullying association in honor of Trish, his sister; and Chris, who was traumatized by seeing his father killed by his alternate self, has traveled to a monastery in India to become a monk, though Lauren keeps tabs on him just in case.",

    "plot": "In New York City, news reporter April O'Neil investigates a crime wave by a group of criminals called the Foot Clan. At a dock at night, she sees the Foot raiding cargo containers. After an unseen vigilante attacks the thieves, April notices a symbol left behind. April's supervisor Bernadette Thompson and her coworkers are oblivious to her story. Later, while covering a charity event thrown by Sacks Industries, April expresses gratitude to the company's CEO Eric Sacks, who was her late father's lab partner. Frustrated by the vigilante, the Clan's leader Shredder has the Foot Soldiers take hostages at a subway station in order to draw him out. April, at the scene, becomes a hostage herself. Four mysterious figures arrive, take out the Clan, and free the hostages. April follows them to a rooftop and realizes that the vigilantes are anthropomorphic mutant turtles, causing her to pass out in shock. When she regains consciousness, they advise her not to tell anyone of their existence. As they leave, April hears Leonardo and Raphael's names. April returns to her apartment and remembers \"Project Renaissance\", her father's science experiment, which involved four turtles named Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo, Raphael, and a mutated rat called Splinter. Unable to convince Bernadette of the Turtles' existence, April is dismissed. Her coworker Vern Fenwick drives her to Sacks' estate where she confides in him about her discovery. Sacks believes her and reveals that he and April's father had been experimenting on a mutagen created to cure disease, which was thought lost in the fire that killed her dad. At Splinter's behest, the Turtles bring April to their sewer lair. Splinter explains how April had saved them all from the fire and freed them into the sewer. The mutagen caused the five of them to grow and develop humanoid attributes. Splinter took on the role of their father, using April's father as an example. After finding a book on Ninjutsu in a storm drain, he proceeded to teach himself, then the Turtles, the fighting style. When April reveals she told Sacks about her discovery of the Turtles, Splinter informs her that Sacks was practically raised by the Shredder and works with him. Then, Shredder and the Foot Soldiers attack the lair, defeating Splinter and incapacitating Raphael while the other Turtles are captured. April comes out of hiding and she and Raphael plan to save the others. At Sacks' estate, he has the Turtles' blood drained in order to create an antidote to a deadly virus that Sacks hopes to flood New York with, believing he will become rich from people seeking his cure. Raphael, April, and Vern storm the estate and free the other Turtles. The group then escapes the compound in pursuit of Sacks. On a radio tower in the city, Sacks and Shredder plant a device that will flood the city with the virus while Sacks is preparing to convert the mutagen into a healing serum. Sacks reveals to April that he killed her father. April and Vern subdue Sacks in the lab, while the Turtles are battling Shredder on the roof. During the fight, the tower's support beams collapse. As the turtles try to keep it from falling and infecting the city, April confronts Shredder with the mutagen. In the struggle, the tower collapses and the Turtles pull April onto it with them, while Shredder falls to the street and is captured by the police. Believing they are about to die, the Turtles confess their secrets, while Raphael gives an impassioned speech about his love for his brothers before they land harmlessly on the street. They vanish before the humans find them and return to the sewers, where they give Splinter the mutagen and he begins to recover. Sometime later, April meets with Vern, who tries and fails to ask her on a date. The Turtles appear in a special modified \"Turtle Van\", and Michelangelo accidentally blows up Vern's new car with a rocket. As the police respond to the explosion, the Turtles leave, but not before Mikey tries to serenade April with \"Happy Together\" by the band The Turtles, much to his brothers' annoyance and April's amusement.",

    "plot": "Charlie Bucket is a kind and loving boy who lives in poverty with his family near the Wonka Factory. The company's owner, Willy Wonka, has long closed his factory to the public due to problems concerning industrial espionage, which also caused all his employees, including Charlie's Grandpa Joe, to lose their jobs. Charlie's father, meanwhile, has more recently been laid off from his own job at a toothpaste factory, although he does not admit this to Charlie. One day, Wonka announces a contest in which Golden Tickets have been placed in five random Wonka Bars worldwide, and the winners will receive a full tour of the factory as well as a lifetime supply of chocolate, while one will receive an additional prize at the end of the tour. Wonka's sales subsequently skyrocket, and the first four tickets are found by the gluttonous Augustus Gloop, the spoiled Veruca Salt, the arrogant, gum-chewing Violet Beauregarde, and the ill-tempered Mike Teavee. Charlie tries twice to find a ticket, but both bars come up empty. After overhearing that the final ticket was found in Russia, Charlie finds a banknote and purchases a third Wonka Bar at the local shop. The Russian ticket is revealed to be a forgery just as Charlie discovers the real ticket inside the wrapper. He receives monetary offers for the ticket, but the cashier warns him not to trade it regardless, and Charlie runs back home. At home, Charlie initially wants to trade the ticket for money for his family's betterment, but after a pep talk from Grandpa George, he decides to keep it, and brings Grandpa Joe to accompany him on the tour. Charlie and the other ticket holders are greeted outside the factory by Wonka, who then leads them into the facility. Individual character flaws cause the other four children to give in to temptation, resulting in their elimination from the tour while Wonka's new employees, the Oompa-Loompas, sing a song of morality after each. Meanwhile, Wonka reminisces on his troubled past and how his dentist father, Wilbur, strictly forbade him from consuming any candy. After sneaking a piece of candy, Wonka instantly became hooked and ran away from home to follow his dreams. When he returned, however, both his father and their house were gone. After the tour, the four eliminated children leave the factory with an exaggerated characteristic or deformity related to their elimination, while Charlie learns that Wonka, now approaching retirement, intended to find a worthy heir. Since Charlie was the least ill-behaved of the five, Wonka invites Charlie to come live and work in the factory with him, provided that he leave his family behind. Charlie declines, as his family is the most important thing in his life. As Charlie and his family's life improve, Wonka becomes despondent, causing his company and sales to decline. He eventually turns to Charlie for advice, and he decides to help Wonka reconcile with his estranged father, Wilbur. During the reunion, Charlie notices newspaper clippings of Wonka's success which Wilbur collected, while Wonka realizes the value of family as he and Wilbur finally reconcile. Afterwards, Wonka allows Charlie and his family to move into the factory together.",

    "plot": "The family of wealthy mystery novelist Harlan Thrombey attends his birthday party at his estate. The next morning, Harlan's housekeeper Fran discovers him dead with a slit throat. Police detectives Lieutenant Elliot and Trooper Wagner believe Harlan died by suicide, but private detective Benoit Blanc is anonymously hired to investigate Harlan's death. Blanc learns Harlan had strained relationships with his family members, giving several of them plausible motives for murder. Unbeknownst to Blanc, Harlan's nurse Marta Cabrera believes she injected Harlan with a lethal dose of morphine after mixing up his bedtime medications the night of the party. To protect Marta from being blamed for his death, Harlan instructed Marta to create a false alibi before he slit his own throat: she was to be seen leaving the house, sneak back in through a window, and disguise herself as Harlan in order to make it appear that he was alive after she left for the night. Marta cannot lie without vomiting, so she gives accurate but incomplete answers when questioned. She agrees to assist Blanc's investigation and conceals evidence incriminating her. At the reading of Harlan's will, Marta is bequeathed his entire fortune and property, stunning the Thrombeys. Harlan's grandson Ransom Drysdale helps Marta flee but manipulates her into confessing to him. Ransom offers further assistance in exchange for a portion of Marta's inheritance. Meanwhile, the other Thrombeys unsuccessfully attempt to influence Marta to renounce the inheritance, even threatening to have her undocumented mother deported. Marta receives a blackmail note containing a partial photocopy of Harlan's toxicology report. She and Ransom drive to the medical examiner's office, only to find it burned down. Marta receives an email proposing a meeting with the blackmailer; Blanc and the police spot them, leading to Ransom being arrested. At the meeting, Marta finds that Fran, the blackmailer, has been drugged; she performs cardiopulmonary resuscitation on Fran and calls an ambulance. Marta confesses to Blanc, but discovers Ransom has already implicated her. Out of moral obligation, Marta believes she must confess to the Thrombeys, which would invalidate the bequest under the slayer rule. At the mansion, Marta finds Fran's copy of the full toxicology report, which shows Harlan had only trace amounts of morphine in his blood. Blanc reveals his deductions to the police, Marta, and Ransom. Blanc deduces Harlan told Ransom about his will, prompting Ransom to swap Harlan's medicines to cause Marta to kill him unknowingly. However, Marta actually gave Harlan the correct medication, recognizing it by viscosity without reading the label due to her experience as a nurse; she only believed she had poisoned Harlan after reading the label on the bottle with the switched content, meaning Harlan's death was indeed suicide, and Marta is not guilty of any part in his death. When the death was reported as a suicide, Ransom anonymously hired Blanc to entrap Marta. Fran saw Ransom tampering with the crime scene and sent him the blackmail note. After Ransom realized that Marta was not responsible for Harlan's death but believed she was, he forwarded the blackmail letter to Marta and burned down the medical examiner's office to destroy evidence of her innocence. Ransom then overdosed Fran with morphine, intending for Marta to be caught with Fran's corpse. The hospital calls; Marta relays that Fran has survived and will implicate Ransom. Ransom insists he will avoid criminal charges because his attempt to kill Fran failed. Marta then vomits on Ransom, revealing she lied: Fran is dead. Realizing he has confessed to the murder, and that the police officers recorded his confession, Ransom grabs a knife from Harlan's collection and attacks Marta, but the knife is a harmless retractable stage knife, and the police promptly arrest him. Blanc tells Marta he suspected early on that she played a part in Harlan's death, noting a drop of blood on her shoe. He tells Marta her innocence prevailed because she made ethical choices that obstructed Ransom's attempts to incriminate her. As Ransom is taken into custody, Marta watches from the balcony of what is now her mansion, with the Thrombeys gathered outside.",

    "plot": "After being homeschooled her entire life and having spent the last twelve years in Africa, 16-year-old Cady Heron begins her first day at North Shore High School. She has trouble making friends and is put down by the teachers on her first day, although she does befriend outcasts Janis Ian and Damian Leigh. Janis and Damian explain the school's various cliques to her, warning her about the \"Plastics\", a trio of wealthy and mean girls consisting of ruthless queen bee Regina George, insecure gossiper Gretchen Wieners, and bubbly airhead Karen Smith. Regina, Gretchen, and Karen take a shine to Cady and unexpectedly invite her to join the Plastics. Upon realizing this, Janis hatches a plan to infiltrate the group and destroy Regina's reputation. Cady becomes infatuated with her classmate Aaron Samuels. Karen and Gretchen warn her that, as Regina's ex-boyfriend, he is off-limits, though Regina assures Cady she does not care if Cady and Aaron date. Despite Janis's insistence that Regina is \"evil\", Cady comes to enjoy hanging out with the group, including writing insulting remarks about their classmates and teachers in a scrapbook called the \"Burn Book.\" However, at a Halloween house party, instead of talking to Aaron on Cady's behalf, Regina kisses him in front of her and resumes their relationship. Feeling betrayed, an enraged Cady fully commits to Janis's plan. Over the following months, Cady, with Janis and Damian's help, manages to trick Gretchen into revealing her secrets, break up Regina's relationship with Aaron (and spend time with him by pretending to need math tutoring), and cause her to gain weight by giving her high-calorie snack bars under the pretense that they are diet food. After violating the Plastics' dress code rules by wearing sweatpants on Monday, Regina is kicked out of the group and Cady becomes the new \"queen bee\". While her parents are out of town, Cady throws a house party. She drunkenly admits to Aaron that she does not actually need math tutoring, and he renounces her for being as manipulative as Regina. Janis and Damian angrily confront Cady for throwing a party instead of attending the former's art show and declare that she has become as plastic as she pretended to be. Meanwhile, Regina discovers Cady's sabotage and inserts fake slander of herself into the Burn Book, hoping to frame the other Plastics. Regina spreads the contents of the book throughout the hallways, inciting chaos. Principal Duvall and math teacher Ms. Norbury gather the female junior students in the gym to talk through their social issues. During this, Janis reveals her plan to destroy Regina to the latter's face and openly mocks her, much to the students' excitement. Regina furiously storms out, pursued by an apologetic Cady. While ranting at Cady, Regina is hit by a school bus; she survives, but fractures her spine. Rumors circulate that Cady intentionally pushed Regina in front of the bus. After realizing a comment she wrote in the Burn Book has framed Ms. Norbury as a drug dealer, Cady decides to take full responsibility for the book. Regina, Gretchen, and Karen are spared punishment but Cady becomes a social pariah and is grounded by her parents. To earn extra credit, Cady joins the school Mathletes, moderated by Ms. Norbury and led by fellow student Kevin Gnapoor. At the state finals, she correctly answers the tiebreaker question, winning the championship. The team arrives at the Spring Fling dance, where Cady is unexpectedly elected queen. She breaks the plastic tiara and distributes the pieces to others in the crowd, makes peace with Janis, Damian, and the Plastics, and shares a slow dance and a kiss with Aaron. The Plastics disband by the time senior year begins. A fully-recovered Regina joins the school's lacrosse team to channel her anger positively, Gretchen joins the \"Cool Asians\" clique, and Karen becomes the school weather girl. Cady begins dating Aaron and continues to hang out with Janis and Damian. Janis starts dating Kevin. While reflecting to herself on the relative social peace that has taken over North Shore High, Cady notices a new popular clique in the freshman class and wonders how long the \"New Plastics\" will last, jokingly imagining them being hit by a school bus.",

During a house party hosted by womanizing jock Steven Stifler, the friends learn that their dorky classmate Chuck Sherman has lost his virginity. Frustrated by their lack of sexual experience, the four make a pact to each lose their virginity by prom night in three weeks. Kevin struggles to seduce Vicky, who fears he only wants her for sex and insists on waiting for the perfect moment to lose her virginity. On the advice of Vicky's friend Jessica, Kevin tries to win Vicky over by giving her an orgasm. Guided by his older brother, he discovers a book of sex tips compiled by former students and uses a cunnilingus technique to rekindle their relationship. Finch pays Jessica to spread rumors about his sexual prowess and large penis, making him popular with the high school girls. When Stifler's prom date ditches him to make herself available for Finch, Stifler spikes Finch's caffè mocha with a laxative. Stifler lures him to the girls' restroom, where he experiences diarrhea, and gathers a crowd to mock him, ruining his carefully crafted reputation. Oz joins the choir to pursue girls unaware of his reputation, but he learns to enjoy performing and gains the attention of Heather, who invites him to the prom. She rescinds the offer after realizing that Oz is faking his sensitive persona, but reconciles with him after seeing his genuine efforts to change. Desperate for experience, Jim, inspired by Oz's description of a vagina, has sex with a warm apple pie, but is humiliated when caught by his father. When Czech foreign exchange student Nadia asks Jim to help her study at his house after her ballet class, Stifler convinces him to set up a webcam so they can watch her change clothes. Jim unwittingly shares the livestream with the school's entire e-mail directory, letting everyone watch as Nadia undresses and masturbates to Jim's porn collection. Encouraged by his friends, Jim purposely walks in on Nadia, and she invites him to join, but, to her disappointment, he prematurely ejaculates twice before they can have sex. Following the incident, Nadia is sent back to the Czech Republic, and Jim becomes the laughingstock of the school. Frustrated and believing she did not see the livestream, Jim asks the seemingly naive band geek Michelle to go to the prom. As school draws to a close, Oz, realizing his feelings for Heather have become sincere, abandons his lacrosse championship game to perform a duet with her. At the prom, Kevin insists Jim, Oz, and Finch fulfil their pact and lose their virginities, but they refuse, frustrated at the social pressures to have sex for the sake of it, and accuse Kevin of using the pact to hide his fear of losing his virginity. After learning that Sherman lied about having sex, the boys reconcile with Kevin, who admits he is afraid. At Stifler's lake house post-prom party, Kevin finally tells Vicky he loves her and they have sex. Afterward, Vicky ends their relationship, admitting it is unrealistic for them to maintain a long-distance romance while attending different colleges; they part while affirming their love for each other. Oz confesses his feelings to Heather, and they spend a romantic night together by the lake. Finch propositions Stifler's mom, and they have sex on the pool table; Stifler later finds them together and faints. Michelle reveals her aggressive sexuality and takes Jim upstairs to lose his virginity. The next day, Jim, Oz, Finch, and Kevin meet up and discuss how things will change after high school, making a toast to their next step.",

    "plot": "On Halloween night, Drew Decker receives a threatening phone call while home alone. Chased outside by somebody dressed as Ghostface, she is stripped to her bra and panties before being stabbed in the breast, removing one of her silicone implants. Her father, who is distracted by receiving fellatio, accidentally hits her with his vehicle, and she looks at her murderer just before she is fatally stabbed. Cindy Campbell meets up with her boyfriend Bobby Prinze and her friends, Brenda Meeks, Ray Wilkins, Greg Phillippe, Buffy Gilmore, and Brenda's stoner brother Shorty. News teams, including hack reporter Gail Hailstorm, converge on the school because of Drew's murder. Gail seduces Buffy's intellectually disabled brother, Special Officer Doofy, to elicit information from him. While in class, Cindy notices the killer watching her from outside before receiving an ominous note and realizes Drew was murdered exactly one year after she and her friends accidentally killed a man by running him over with a car then dumping his body in a lake. After football practice, Greg finds a photo of his small penis on his locker saying \"I KNOW\" on it. Believing Ray took the photo, he confronts him & their friends. Cindy tells her friends about the note, attempting to convince them to tell the police, but Greg beats her instead, fearing imprisonment for the murder of the previous year. At Buffy's beauty pageant that evening, the killer murders Greg in plain view, while the audience mistakes her pleas for help as part of her dramatic reading. Buffy eventually wins the pageant and forgets Greg. The killer attacks Cindy while home alone but retreats when she contacts the police. Bobby arrives and is arrested after a cellphone, knife, and gloves fall out of his pocket. As Cindy spends the night at Buffy and Doofy's, she receives a call from the killer. The following day, Bobby is released from jail. Buffy is beheaded by the killer with a cleaver. That night, Gail and her cameraman Kenny go to a makeout spot to get a murder on camera. After they film the killer murdering teenager Heather, he chases them into the woods and murders Kenny. Gail later gives a snot-filled apology to Kenny's family, a parody of a scene from The Blair Witch Project. Later that night, Ray and Brenda go to the movies to see Shakespeare in Love, where Ray is stabbed through his ear in a bathroom stall through a glory hole. The killer nearly murders Brenda, but angry movie patrons, weary of her obnoxious behavior in the theater, stab her to death to silence her, as revenge for spoiling several films. Meanwhile, Cindy has a house party, hoping for safety in numbers. One of her friends, Tina, is killed while getting beer from the garage. During the party, Cindy and Bobby go upstairs and have sex. The killer gets stoned with Shorty and his friends in the basement, but accidentally kills all but Shorty. After the pair has sex, the killer stabs Bobby and disappears. Cindy gets a gun from a drawer and Bobby follows. Shorty comes up from the basement warning about the killer, but Bobby shoots him. Ray arrives on the scene, still alive, with a voice changer. Bobby and Ray confront Cindy in the kitchen, announcing they will only kill her and her father, and that they are merely copying the real killer. Bobby admits to being gay, while Ray denies it. The plan backfires when Ray stabs and kills Bobby out of anger because his favorite show, The Wayans Bros., has been canceled after five seasons without getting a final episode.

However, the killer vanishes before the police arrive, to Cindy's dismay.

    "title": "Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood",
    "plot": "In February 1969, Hollywood actor Rick Dalton, a former Western TV star, copes with a fading career, his most recent roles being guest appearances as TV villains. Agent Marvin Schwarz suggests working in spaghetti Westerns in Italy, which Dalton considers inferior. Dalton's best friend, stunt double, personal assistant, and driver is Cliff Booth, a World War II veteran living in a trailer with his pit bull Brandy. Booth struggles to find stunt work due to a past altercation with Bruce Lee, and rumors that he killed his wife. Although he does not know them personally, Dalton is aware that young actress Sharon Tate and her husband, director Roman Polanski, live next door. Dalton longs to befriend them, thinking it could reignite his career. While fixing the TV antenna on Dalton's roof, Booth notices a hippie arriving at the Polanski residence. The man, Charles Manson, asks for music producer Terry Melcher, but Tate's friend, Jay Sebring, says Melcher has moved. Later, Tate watches herself in The Wrecking Crew at a local film theater, and Booth gives hitchhiker Pussycat a ride to Spahn Ranch, a former Western film set where Booth did stunt work. Booth checks on George Spahn, the ranch's nearly blind owner, seeking to make sure the hippies living there are not exploiting him. Booth physically forces ranch hippie Clem to change his car tire after it was deliberately punctured. The hippies' leader Tex is summoned to deal with the situation, but he arrives as Booth is driving away. While filming an episode for the TV series Lancer, Dalton struggles to deliver his lines, causing him to have an emotional breakdown in his trailer. He later gives a powerful performance during his character's speech, impressing director Sam Wanamaker and his co-star Trudi, boosting his confidence. Schwarz books Dalton to star in a Sergio Corbucci spaghetti Western. Booth accompanies Dalton for the six-month shoot in Italy, where Dalton films three additional films and marries Italian starlet Francesca Capucci. Before returning to the US, Dalton tells Booth that he can no longer afford his salary, which Booth amicably understands. Returning to Los Angeles on August 8, 1969, Dalton and Booth go drinking to commemorate their time together. Returning to Dalton's house, Booth smokes an acid-laced cigarette and takes Brandy for a walk, while Dalton makes margaritas. Manson's followers Tex, Sadie, Katie and Flowerchild arrive to murder the Tate house occupants. Hearing a car's loud muffler, an enraged Dalton orders the group off the private street. Recognizing him, the family members decide to kill him instead, when Sadie reasons that through shows such as Dalton’s, Hollywood has \"taught them to murder\". Flowerchild deserts the group, fleeing with their car. Breaking into Dalton's house armed with knives and a gun, the remaining group confronts Capucci and Booth, with Tex announcing that he is “the Devil and here to do the Devil’s business”. Booth recognizes them from Spahn Ranch and orders Brandy to attack. Brandy mauls Tex and bites off his genitals, and Cliff finishes him off by stomping him to death. He is stabbed by Katie, but swiftly beats her to death using random objects around the home. Brandy attacks and disfigures Sadie, who crashes through the back garden and startles Dalton, who has been listening to music and was totally unaware of the fighting inside. As Sadie attempts to shoot him, Dalton retrieves a working stunt flamethrower from a shed and incinerates her with it. After the police have taken statements and an ambulance brings Booth to hospital, Sebring and Tate invite Dalton to Tate’s house for a drink.",

    "plot": "A gang of Ukrainian mobsters manage to steal a device known as \"The Handle,\" estimated to be worth billions. The British government hires Nathan Jasmine to retrieve the Handle before billionaire arms dealer, Greg Simmonds, can sell it to the highest bidder. Nathan hires super-spy Orson Fortune to lead a team made up of Sarah Fidel and JJ Davies. The team travels to Madrid, seeking the courier intended to transport the hard drive containing the data from the Handle. Their search is interrupted by Mike, a rival of Nathan's, who seems to have also been hired to retrieve the Handle. Sarah, an American and a skilled hacker, manages to copy the hard drive's contents first. Learning that Simmonds plans to host a charity gala in Cannes, the team decides to infiltrate it by blackmailing his favorite movie star, Danny Francesco, into helping them distract Simmonds. Simmonds invites Danny and 'Michaela' (Sarah's cover as his girlfriend) to spend some time in his Turkish villa in Antalya. Orson infiltrates the Ukrainian mafia house to aid Sarah in hacking their computers, disguising it as a robbery. The British government warns Nathan that the Handle is an advanced AI capable of being programmed to defeat any security system in the world. Upon learning that the exchange for the Handle will take place in Antalya, the team travels to Turkey. While Simmonds shows Danny his memorabilia, Orson and JJ work to track down one of Simmonds' moles within the Turkish government. Disguised as Simmonds' lawyer, Orson attends the exchange and finalizes it, but Mike and his men intervene, resulting in the death of almost everyone present and the theft of the Handle. This incident makes it clear that Mike has gone rogue and is working independently. Despite the problems the team has caused him, Simmonds is willing to help because Mike's theft of the Handle has cost Simmonds his commission. Simmonds tells them that the buyers were two bio-tech moguls, Trent and Arnold, who have been hoarding gold and intend to use the Handle to cause a worldwide financial collapse. While Orson and JJ clear heavy security on ground level, Simmonds and Danny go up into the tower where Mike is finalizing the deal for the Handle with the tech moguls. Simmonds shows them how he could easily take out their loved ones if he is not paid for the weapon. He and Danny manage to leave before everyone turns on one another. As Orson arrives, the only one left is Mike, so Orson takes him out and retrieves the Handle. In Doha, the team is offered another job, but they decide to go on vacation. Orson tells them he has used the proceeds from the robbery at the Ukrainians' villa to finance Danny's new film, about the film's events, with Danny playing Simmonds and Simmonds acting as an on-set producer.",

    "title": "10 Things I Hate About You",
    "plot": "Cameron James, a new student at Padua High School in the Seattle area, immediately becomes smitten with beautiful and popular sophomore Bianca Stratford. Geeky Michael Eckman warns him that she is vapid and conceited, and that her overprotective single father Walter, an obstetrician worried about teenage pregnancy, does not allow her or her shrewish older sister Kat, a senior, to date until they graduate. Kat is accepted to Sarah Lawrence College in New York, but Walter wants her to stay close to home and attend his alma mater, the University of Washington. Frustrated by Bianca's insistence and Kat's rebelliousness, Walter relents and declares that Bianca may date only when Kat does, knowing that Kat's unsocial attitude will greatly complicate it. When Cameron asks Bianca out, she informs him of her father's new rule and suggests he find someone willing to date Kat so that Bianca can freely date affluent senior Joey Donner. Cameron selects Australian \"bad boy\" Patrick Verona, who initially frightens him with his attitude. Michael convinces Joey to pay Patrick to ask out Kat, to which Patrick agrees, but Kat rebuffs his first few advances. After Michael and Cameron probe Bianca for information on Kat's preferences, Patrick begins to win Kat's interest. She goes to a party with him, enabling Bianca and her best friend Chastity Church to tag along, greatly upsetting Walter. At the party, Kat becomes upset upon seeing Bianca with Joey, and responds by getting intoxicated. Patrick attends to her, and she starts to open up to him, expressing her interest in forming a band. When Kat attempts to kiss him, Patrick pulls away, causing her to depart, infuriated. Meanwhile, Bianca upsets Cameron by ignoring him for Joey, but she soon realizes that Joey is shallow and self-absorbed. When she asks Cameron to drive her home, he admits his feelings for her are genuine and her treatment of him has frustrated him, and she reconciliatorily kisses him. Joey offers to pay Patrick to take Kat to the prom so he can take Bianca. He initially refuses, but relents when Joey offers him more money. Although Kat is still angry with Patrick, he eventually wins her over by serenading her, accompanied by the Padua High School marching band, with a performance of \"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\" by Frankie Valli, and she returns the favor by assisting him in sneaking out of detention. Their subsequent date turns romantic, but Kat becomes suspicious when Patrick insists that she accompany him to the prom, which she adamantly opposes. Irritated at not being asked to the prom by Cameron, Bianca accepts Joey's invitation, but Walter declines to allow it unless Kat accompanies her. Kat confesses to Bianca that she dated Joey when they were freshmen and, succumbing to peer pressure, had sex with him, later regretting it. After Joey dumped her, she vowed against doing anything out of peer pressure. Bianca insists that she can decide her own life, so Kat goes to the prom with Patrick, and Bianca goes to the prom with Cameron instead of Joey. Joey goes to the prom with Chastity. At the prom, Bianca learns from Chastity that Joey was planning to have sex with Bianca that night. Angry that Bianca has spurned him for Cameron, Joey reveals his arrangement with Patrick, which causes Kat to leave, heartbroken. Joey then shoves Michael and punches Cameron, but Bianca then assaults him for hurting her, Kat, and Cameron. Bianca and Cameron share another kiss. The following day, Bianca reconciles with Kat and begins dating Cameron. Comfortable that Kat can handle herself, Walter allows her to attend Sarah Lawrence College. For an assignment in which the students were tasked to write their own versions of William Shakespeare's Sonnet 141, Kat reads aloud a poem she wrote, entitled \"10 Things I Hate About You\", revealing that she still loves and cares about Patrick. He surprises her with a Fender Stratocaster that he bought with the money Joey paid him, and confesses that he has fallen for her. Kat forgives him, and they reconcile with a kiss.",

    "title": "Cruella",
    "plot": "In 1964 England, Estella Miller is a creative child with a talent for fashion, but is ostracized for her black and white hair. She develops a nefarious streak, so her mother, Catherine, nicknames her \"Cruella\" and encourages her to be nicer. After Estella is expelled from school, Catherine decides to move them to London, stopping at a party at Hellman Hall, a mansion on the Suffolk coast to ask the host for money. Sneaking inside, Estella loses her mother's necklace while being chased by the host's Dalmatian dogs, which push Catherine off a cliffside balcony to her death. Orphaned, Estella runs away to London and befriends street urchins Jasper and Horace. The three become great friends; Estella practices thievery and grifts with Jasper and Horace, honing her fashion skills by designing their disguises, alongside their dogs, Buddy and Wink. For her birthday in 1977, Jasper gets her a job at the Liberty department store, but Estella is made a janitor and denied the chance to use her talents. She drunkenly redecorates the window display and impresses Baroness von Hellman, a renowned but authoritarian haute couture designer who offers her a coveted job at her fashion house. Estella gains the Baroness' confidence, but notices her wearing Catherine's necklace, which she claims is a family heirloom once stolen by an employee. Estella asks Jasper and Horace to help retrieve it during the Baroness’ Black and White Ball, suspecting that the Baroness is lying. To conceal her identity, Estella creates the alter ego \"Cruella\", letting her natural hair show rather than wearing her usual wig, and wearing one of the Baroness' old designs from a vintage clothing store owned by the flamboyant Artie. At the ball, Cruella steals the spotlight as Jasper and Horace break into the Baroness' vault, but they realize that the Baroness is already wearing the necklace. Jasper improvises and releases rats into the party, allowing the disguised Estella to swipe the necklace. The Baroness summons her Dalmatians with a dog whistle, leading Estella to realize that the Baroness was the one responsible for her mother Catherine's death. In the ensuing chaos, a Dalmatian swallows the necklace. Seeking revenge, Estella orders Jasper and Horace to kidnap the Dalmatians, and recovers the necklace. She then upstages the Baroness at various events in extravagant fashions, gaining notoriety via society columnist Anita Darling, Estella's childhood friend who has agreed to continue writing articles about her. The furious Baroness fires her lawyer, Roger Dearly, while Estella's increasingly haughty behavior discomforts Jasper. Estella designs and sews an elaborately beaded dress, secretly disguising moth cocoons as beads, as the signature piece for the Baroness' spring collection. The night of the spring show, the Baroness opens the vault to find that the collection has been destroyed by the moths, and realizes Estella and Cruella are the same person. Having wrecked the Baroness' show, Cruella stages her own rock music fashion show outside in Regent's Park, wearing a faux Dalmatian-fur coat to trick the Baroness into thinking she had killed her dogs. Returning home, Estella is confronted by the Baroness and her men, who have captured Jasper and Horace. Setting fire to the building, the Baroness leaves a bound Estella to die, and has Jasper and Horace sent to prison for her murder. Estella is saved by John, the Baroness' valet, who reveals that the necklace unlocks a box containing Estella's birth records; the Baroness is her biological mother. She told the Baron von Hellman the baby died, and secretly ordered John to murder the infant Estella so the Baroness could focus on her career and keep her husband's inheritance; the heartbroken Baron died soon after that. Instead, John gave the baby to Catherine, one of the Baroness' maids, who raised Estella in secret. Estella breaks Jasper and Horace out of prison and reveals the truth, recruiting them, Artie, and John for her final scheme to expose the Baroness. The quintet sneaks into the Baroness' charity gala, having arranged for all the guests to dress in black and white, in honor of Cruella. On the balcony, Estella confronts her mother, who feigns an embrace before pushing her over the cliff, unwittingly witnessed by her guests. Estella secretly survives with a hidden parachute and, now legally dead, adopts her Cruella persona for good. The Baroness is arrested by the Metropolitan Police, swearing revenge on Estella. Before \"dying\", Estella willed her inheritance to Cruella, including the manor which she renames from Hellman Hall to \"Hell Hall\", moving in with her accomplices. Cruella sends Dalmatian puppies to both Anita and Roger—the latter now works as a musician—respectively named Perdita and Pongo. Roger is smitten with Pongo, and begins to write a song about Cruella on his piano.",

    "plot": "In 1950, arms dealer and industrialist Anatole \"Zsa-Zsa\" Korda narrowly survives an assassination attempt. While unconscious, he enters the afterlife, where a divine court judges his worthiness to enter Heaven. Knowing he cannot run from assassins forever, Korda tries to mend his relationship with his only daughter, Catholic novice Sister Liesl. He asks Liesl to quit the Church and take over his business. Liesl's adoptive parents sent her away to a convent at the age of five. Korda and Liesl have a testy relationship; he is rumored to have murdered Liesl's mother, although he denies this. Liesl also meets Bjørn, a Norwegian entomologist and Korda's tutor/administrative assistant. Governments around the world want to stop Korda's unethical business practices, and also his causing wars and peace when it's contrary to their aims. An opportunity arises when Korda stakes his fortune on a risky scheme to overhaul the infrastructure of Phoenicia with slave labor. Government agent Excalibur conspires to drive up the price of building materials, which threatens to bankrupt Korda. With Liesl and Bjørn in tow, Korda meets with, and attempts to swindle, his investors. He deceitfully asks Californians Leland and Reagan to sign a contract increasing their financial contribution without telling them about the change, blackmails French nightclub owner Marseille Bob, and threatens to kill East Coast businessman Marty in a suicide bombing. Although his investors are enraged, Korda worms his way out of each scenario. However, the investors agree to cover only 50% of the budget shortfall. During the trip, Liesl and Korda explore their odd relationship. After taking a bullet for Marseille Bob, Korda meets Liesl's mother in the afterlife; she tells him that he is not Liesl's father. Korda realizes that all he had to offer his family was money, not love. In addition, during his confrontation with Marty, a guilt-ridden Korda admits he knew Liesl's mother was having an affair with his estranged half-brother Nubar. To get back at her, he faked a story that she was also having an affair with Nubar's assistant, which prompted Nubar to kill her. He also admits he still does business with Nubar, who has also invested in the Phoenician scheme. Liesl is outraged at her father's amorality, but agrees to continue helping him so that she can send Nubar to jail. In a last-ditch attempt to avoid asking Nubar for help, Korda offers to marry his cousin Hilda, an heiress to the Korda armaments fortune. She accepts his proposal but refuses to increase her investment. On the flight back home, saboteurs destroy Korda's plane. The wreckage reveals evidence that Bjørn is a spy working for Excalibur's consortium. However, he agrees to switch sides, as he has fallen in love with Liesl. Korda explains to Liesl that their family has been dysfunctional for generations. Disturbed, Liesl resolves to quit the family business and return to the Church. A group of guerillas rescue the party and take them home, where Liesl's mother superior dismisses her from the order, explaining that she is too materialistic for the religious life. Korda's investors gather at the Desert Oasis Palace hotel to witness a presentation of his scheme. Korda, Liesl, and Bjørn finally meet with Nubar, who announces that he is withdrawing his entire investment. Nubar denies being Liesl's real father and reveals that he was the one trying to kill Korda all along, reasoning that life is a game of \"who could lick whom\". Nubar tries to kill Korda in a brawl, but Korda defeats him. Korda decides to change his ways: he converts to Catholicism, pays his workers, and throws his entire fortune into completing the Phoenician scheme, reasoning that finishing a worthy project will give his life meaning. Although he is bankrupted, Liesl is impressed and agrees to accept him as her father. The two retire to a simpler life running a small bistro. Hilda has her brief marriage to Korda annulled and gives back her wedding ring. Korda loans the ring to Bjørn, who proposes to Liesl; she accepts. At the end of the day, Liesl and Korda play cards together as a family.",

While taping an episode, Lydia sees Betelgeuse, who tried to marry her, in the audience. Lydia's stepmother Delia later discloses that her father Charles has died in a shark attack as the family returns to Winter River for his funeral. At the wake, Lydia's boyfriend and producer, Rory, pressures her to marry him on Halloween and hesitantly agrees. Meanwhile, Astrid meets local boy Jeremy Frazier, who invites her to spend the holiday with him. In the Netherworld, Betelgeuse manages a call centre consisting of shrunken-headed employees and remains obsessed with marrying Lydia, who he is now haunting. Former actor-turned-detective Wolf Jackson informs Betelgeuse that his ex-wife, occultist Delores LaFerve, has resurfaced and is draining the souls of the deceased while hunting him down. The couple met during the Black Death in Italy when Delores poisoned Betelgeuse during their honeymoon as part of an immortality ritual; he then butchered her before succumbing. Astrid realizes she has inherited her mother's abilities and discovers Jeremy is a ghost. He persuades her to accompany him to the Netherworld so she can see her father, in reality, a trick to exchange souls so he can live again. Lydia learns from local realtor Jane Butterfield Jr. that Jeremy murdered his parents when he was alive and died trying to evade the police when they came to arrest him; she reluctantly summons Betelgeuse, who reveals his deception, and agrees to marry him in exchange for entering the Netherworld to save Astrid. Betelgeuse disguises his lead employee, Bob, as himself to use as a decoy. Wolf discovers Betelgeuse has brought a living person into their world and launches a manhunt for him, capturing the disguised Bob; he then encounters Delores at the police station and is drained of his soul. As Betelgeuse and Lydia search for Astrid, Jeremy escorts her through the afterlife's bureaucracy, then reveals his true intent to Astrid, who is taken to the \"Soul Train\" to be sent to the \"Great Beyond\". Lydia saves Astrid right before the train departs. They escape through a portal to Saturn's moon Titan, where Richard, working as a civil servant, saves them from one of its Sandworms. During a mourning ceremony for Charles, Delia is fatally bitten by a pair of asps that she was assured were defanged and arrives in the Netherworld as she summons Betelgeuse to help find Charles, agreeing in exchange for help finding Lydia. Meanwhile, Richard helps his wife and daughter return to the living world while Betelgeuse voids Jeremy's visa and sends him to the \"Fires of Damnation\". Returning home, Astrid apologizes to Lydia for her initial disbelief. The duo arrive at the church for Lydia and Rory's wedding, but Betelgeuse crashes the ceremony with Delia as he then injects Rory with \"truth serum\", forcing him to admit that he never believed in Lydia's abilities and is only a profiteering gold digger. As Betelgeuse takes over, Wolf and his fellow officers appear, only to be kept at bay. Delores then arrives to take her retribution just as Astrid summons a Sandworm that Betelgeuse goads into devouring her and Rory. Astrid then reveals that Betelgeuse's marriage contract is voided due to him illegally bringing her mother into the Netherworld as Lydia banishes him back there. Delia is then escorted back to the Netherworld by Wolf, reuniting with Charles at the Soul Train's station as the couple then depart for the Great Beyond together.

    "plot": "In London, MI6 agent Hattie Shaw and her team attempt to retrieve a programmable supervirus nicknamed 'Snowflake' from Eteon, a techno-terrorist organization. The team secures Snowflake, but is attacked by Brixton Lore, an ex-MI6 agent and Eteon operative, who has cybernetic implants allowing him to perform superhuman feats. Brixton kills every agent except Hattie, who injects herself with the only dose of Snowflake before escaping. Brixton frames Hattie for killing her team and stealing Snowflake, forcing her to go on the run. Luke Hobbs is an ex-DSS agent and Deckard Shaw, Hattie's older brother, is an ex-MI6 agent. They are informed of the missing virus and, after arguing due to their past as fierce rivals, reluctantly work together to track it down. After a brief meeting at a CIA black site at 122 Leadenhall Street, Deckard goes to Hattie's apartment for information, but he is attacked by Eteon operatives. Luke finds Hattie, who instigates a fight with him, but Luke manages to bring her to a CIA office. As Deckard arrives and informs Luke that Hattie is his sister, the office is attacked by Eteon forces. Hattie is kidnapped by Brixton, whom Deckard recognizes as an old colleague-turned-enemy he thought that he killed. Luke and Deckard rescue Hattie and evade Brixton during an ensuing car chase. However, Brixton frames all three as criminals via Eteon's control of global news media. The three locate Snowflake's creator Prof. Andreiko and learn that he purposed it to efficiently deliver vaccines; to prevent Eteon from using it to eradicate humanity, Hattie must either be cremated, while the virus is still dormant or have it removed with a specialized extraction device located at Eteon's facility in Chernobyl. Despite Luke briefly being detained at the airport due to Deckard giving him the fake name Mike Oxmaul, the three manage to travel to Moscow. After rendezvousing with Deckard's ex-girlfriend Margarita to rearm in Moscow, the three infiltrate the facility. They retrieve the device before escaping in a truck during the facility's destruction, but Andreiko is killed by Brixton and the device is damaged. Luke takes Deckard and Hattie to his childhood home in Samoa to visit his estranged brother Jonah, a talented mechanic, to repair the device and lay low before confronting Brixton's forces again. Luke has a tense reunion with his family, to whom he has not spoken since he gave up his criminal father to the authorities. Despite Jonah's objections, their mother and Deckard convince him to help repair the device and oppose Eteon's incoming forces. The makeshift battalion prepares for Eteon's arrival, disabling the weapons used by Eteon's team by temporarily shutting down their authorization code and setting up a variety of traps around the island. Jonah successfully repairs the device and starts the virus extraction just as Brixton and his army arrive. In the ensuing battle, the Samoans engage and easily overpower Brixton's reinforcements, while suffering minimal casualties. Brixton recaptures Hattie with a helicopter, but the Samoans join Luke and Deckard in bringing the aircraft down with several custom trucks. Luke and Deckard alternate their attacks to defeat Brixton, who is later killed remotely by Eteon's unseen director. The director sends a message claiming to know Luke and intending to persuade him and the Shaw siblings, while Luke and Deckard promise to track down the director. The group later celebrates their victory. In post-credits scenes, Luke brings his daughter to meet extended family in Samoa, while Deckard and Hattie are implied to break their mother out of prison. Luke receives a call from his partner Locke, who has broken into a laboratory and discovered a more threatening virus. Luke also sets the police in London on Deckard in retaliation for the Mike Oxmaul prank, telling the police that Deckard's name is Hugh Janus.",

    "plot": "American struggling stand-up comedian Kat Bryant teaches improv in London. One day, recruited by Detective Sergeant Graham Billings of the Metropolitan Police tasked to find actors for low-level sting operations, she approaches two of her newest students—Marlon Swift, an aspiring actor, and Hugh, a socially awkward IT worker—to form a trio. They are all frustrated professionally. Kat teaches the improv group after losing hope of being discovered. Marlon has only gotten an occasional random commercial, so is dropped by his manager. The introverted, insecure Hugh lacks self-confidence and is lonely. Kat, whose visa is expiring and still relationship-free, goes to her friend's wedding shower. There, everyone else is successful professionally and personally. They pity Kate, so offer to loan her money. The trio, 'Bonnie', 'Roach' and 'The Squire', is sent to investigate a shop selling counterfeit cigarettes. Improvising, they inadvertantly get led to mid-level criminal dealer Fly. When he offers them stolen cocaine, Kat cons the rival Albanian gang into buying back their own drugs, as Fly's associate Shosh had inadvertently nicked them. Impressed, Fly recruits them, so Billings insists they continue undercover. Using aliases, they intimidate Sagar, who owes Fly money, then subsequently dies while fleeing. Detective Inspector Dawes leads the official investigation into the death. He mistakes them for professional criminals, as they appear in several surveilance photos. The trio gains credibility, as Sagar was a former hitman. Fly takes them out drinking for his birthday, where Kat's school friends on a hen night run into them. Kat improvises until Shosh and Fly scare them off. Fly's boss Metcalfe asks to meet the trio. Unhappy, as the Albanians, who realised they had been tricked, are refusing to supply him with cocaine. Kat demands Billings pull them, as Metcalfe killed someone while they watched, but he insists they continue. However, when the trio later try to negotiate with dealer K-Lash, who is selling individual nitrous oxide vials rather than cocaine, unfortunately 'Roach' speaks for them. He talks in threatening gibberish, then throws a real-looking, toy grenade, so the deal collapses and they flee. They discover Billings is corrupt and using them for personal gain. After his blackmailing monologue, Shosh kills him. Metcalfe attempts to identify Billings' associates by checking his last calls, but initially is unsuccessful. The trio is tasked with chopping up Billings. Kat insists they go along to not be outed, but ultimately it is method-actor Marlon who grabs the chainsaw. Dividing the parts among three trash bags, Hugh uses his company credit card to rent them bikes. DI Dawes and DS Beverley track them down, but the trio loses them by splitting off. Reuniting, Kat and Marlon go to her friend's dinner party to borrow her car keys. Actually an intervention, Kat plays along, while guiding Malcolm to the keys. Meanwhile, Hugh fends off a neighbourhood dog from the bags of body parts. Armed with the keys, the trio hurries off with the body, feigning she is heading to rehab. Burying the body parts with Shosh, afterwards she drops off Kat and Marlon in town, taking Hugh home. As Shosh mentions Metcalfe is having Billings' phone hacked downtown, Kate and Marlon race to intercept it. However, it is a trap, and Metcalfe orders their execution. Fly takes the trio to a remote area, making them believe Shosh is digging their graves. Each apologises to the others, but he sets them free, as Metcalfe went too far. Shortly after, before they can flee England, the group is captured by Dawes and faces charges, as they lack proof of Billings' corruption. As he believes the three are undercover cops, Kat convinces Fly to wear a wire during a meeting with the Albanians for immunity for all four of them. During the deal, the trio, now 'undercover officers', intervenes to save Fly and record Metcalfe admitting to the drugs, so the real police storm in to arrest the criminals. Metcalfe is killed by Shosh, who escapes. Fly, learning the three are actually improv actors, rewards them with cash. Afterwards, Marlon's acting career takes off, Hugh pursues his real passion by opening a wine shop, and Kat's improv group becomes enormously popular, amid rumours of their undercover work.",

Meanwhile, on another planet, bounty hunter Lilith is contacted by Atlas, a powerful corporate magnate. He convinces her to rescue Tina, his daughter. Lilith returns to Pandora, her home planet, for the first time since she was a child. With the help of Claptrap, a robot that was mysteriously programmed to wait for her on Pandora, she locates Tina.

When Lilith recovers, Claptrap unknowingly plays a holographic message for her, recorded by her mother. The next day, without Lilith and Claptrap, the team find the Vault only to realize that Atlas is waiting for them, and they fight off his men. However, Tina is unable to open the Vault. Lilith appears and explains that she is the one who can do it, being an Eridian known as the Firehawk. Atlas threatens to kill Tina if Lilith does not open the Vault. She obeys but, with Tina's help, traps Atlas inside, where a creature drags him away. The group celebrates their survival.",

    "plot": "Willy Wonka, a young chocolatier, arrives at the Galéries Gourmet with dreams of establishing his own chocolate shop. Wonka is coerced to stay at Mrs. Scrubitt's boarding house by her co-worker, Bleacher, and unknowingly signs a predatory contract due to his illiteracy. He introduces \"hoverchocs\", which make the consumer fly, but rivals Arthur Slugworth, Gerald Prodnose, and Felix Fickelgruber have Wonka's earnings confiscated by the police for selling without a shop. Unable to pay the contract's exorbitant fees, Wonka is forced to work in Scrubbitt's launderette alongside her foster daughter, Noodle, and fellow captives Abacus Crunch, Piper Benz, Larry Chucklesworth, and Lottie Bell. Wonka befriends Noodle, who agrees to teach him how to read. Meanwhile, the \"Chocolate Cartel\" bribe the Chief of Police to torment Wonka. Crunch, having previously worked for Slugworth as an accountant, reveals that the Cartel has a secret vault of chocolate, used for bribes to maintain their power. Wonka and the launderette workers embark on a chocolate-selling crusade to alleviate their debts, using the city's storm drains to evade the police. Wonka discovers his chocolates are being pilfered by an Oompa Loompa named Lofty, who seeks retribution for the cocoa beans Wonka took from Loompaland under his watch. Wonka finally opens his dream chocolate shop, but the Cartel bribe Scrubitt to sabotage his chocolates with Yeti sweat. Chaos ensues among Wonka's customers, disfigured from the sabotaged chocolates, leading to the destruction of the shop. Wonka reluctantly accepts the Cartel's offer to pay off everyone's debts in exchange for him leaving town by boat. The laundry workers are released, but Slugworth pays Scrubitt to keep Noodle indefinitely. Wonka deduces that Noodle and Slugworth are related, before he, with Lofty aboard, realizes the Cartel has rigged the boat to explode. After escaping from the boat and rescuing Noodle, Wonka and his friends devise a strategy to obtain the Cartel's incriminating account book. Wonka and Noodle infiltrate the Cartel's headquarters, only to be confronted by the Cartel. Slugworth reveals that after the death of Noodle's father, his own brother Zebedee, he lied to her mother Dorothy Smith that Noodle had died as well and gave the newborn to Scrubitt. Held at gunpoint and locked in the Cartel's vault of liquid chocolate, Wonka and Noodle nearly drown, but Lofty, still seeking reimbursement from Wonka, rescues them. Wonka and Noodle expose the Cartel's misdeeds, releasing their chocolate reserves into the city fountain, now laced with Wonka's unique ingredients, ruining the Cartel's enterprise. The Cartel float away, having eaten Wonka's hoverchocs, and the Chief is arrested. Wonka reunites Noodle with her mother and purchases an abandoned castle that he transforms into his own chocolate factory, with Lofty heading the tasting department.

    "title": "Saltburn",
    "plot": "In late 2006, scholarship student Oliver Quick struggles to fit in at the University of Oxford because of his inexperience with upper-class manners. He befriends Felix Catton, an affluent and popular student who is sympathetic to Oliver's stories of his parents' substance abuse and mental health issues. When Oliver becomes distraught over his father's sudden death, Felix comforts him and invites him to spend the summer at his family's country house, Saltburn. At Saltburn, Oliver meets Felix's parents Sir James and Lady Elspeth, his sister Venetia, and Elspeth's friend Pamela, and he reunites with Felix's American cousin Farleigh, with whom Oliver has had a tense relationship as Oxford classmates. Oliver quickly wins over Felix's family except for Farleigh, and his obsession with Felix grows. One night, after watching Felix masturbate in a bathtub, he lustfully drinks the semen-laced bathwater. Later, having seen Venetia waiting outside his bedroom window, he performs oral sex on her while she is on her period. Farleigh witnesses this and informs Felix, but Oliver claims nothing happened when Felix confronts him. At night, Oliver initiates sexual advances on Farleigh, threatening him in the process. The next morning, James evicts Farleigh after receiving a report from Sotheby's about his intention to sell some of James's valuables. As the summer ends, Elspeth and James plan a party for Oliver's birthday. Felix surprises Oliver with a trip to see his estranged mother, causing Oliver to panic. Upon arriving at the family's house in Prescot, Felix realises Oliver had lied to him about his upbringing. His father is still alive, neither of his parents has substance abuse or mental health troubles, and they live in a respectable middle class suburb. Horrified and hurt by Oliver's deception, Felix decides not to tell anyone to spare his own family the humiliation but orders Oliver to leave Saltburn after the party. During the extravagant celebrations, Oliver seeks to make amends with Felix by expressing his adoration for him, but Felix rejects him and suggests he seek help. The next morning, Felix is found dead in Saltburn's hedge maze. Oliver implies Felix's death was connected to Farleigh supplying drugs during the party, and James withdraws financial support from Farleigh and bans him from ever returning. Oliver mourns Felix and visits his grave alone, where he lies naked on the grave soil and masturbates on it. After Felix's funeral, Elspeth insists Oliver extend his stay at Saltburn. Venetia, increasingly distraught and disturbed, accuses Oliver of destroying her family. He attempts to seduce her, but she eventually rebuffs him. The next day, Venetia is found dead, having slit her wrists in the bathtub. Despondent over Oliver's continuing presence at Saltburn and Elspeth's closeness to him, James bribes him to leave, which Oliver accepts. In 2022, Oliver reads about James's death in a newspaper. He subsequently has what seems to be a chance encounter with Elspeth at a café. She is delighted to see him again, insisting he return with her to Saltburn. After spending several months with Oliver, Elspeth becomes terminally ill. On her deathbed, Oliver confides to Elspeth that he is responsible for all of the tragic and horrifying events at Saltburn. He orchestrated his initial meeting with Felix at Oxford and poisoned Felix's drink in the maze, resulting in his death. He also placed razor blades beside Venetia while she was bathing, encouraging her suicide. He even planned his encounter with Elspeth at the café, after which she bequeathed all her assets, including Saltburn, to him. He then removes her life support, killing her. Having now assumed ownership of Saltburn and the Catton family fortune, Oliver happily dances naked around the mansion.",

    "title": "Zombadings 1: Patayin sa Shokot si Remington",
    "plot": "Young Remington (Andre Salazar) has a habit of spotting gay men and loudly calling them \"Bakla!\" (a Filipino term for \"gay\"). Everything changes during a trip to the cemetery, however, where he briefly encounters a grieving drag queen named Pops (Roderick Paulate) and taunts him for his sexuality. Infuriated, Pops swears that Remington would grow up to become gay on his 21st birthday, scaring the young boy. Many years later, an epidemic of murders of gay men erupts in the little town of Lucban, which Remington's mother, Fe (Janice de Belen), a policewoman, and her co-policewoman Mimi (Angelica Kanapi) are unable to solve. Twenty-year old Remington (Martin Escudero) takes a peek at one such crime scene along with curious passersby in the nearest field when he chances upon a young woman named Hannah Montano (Lauren Young), who recently returned to her hometown, and tries getting to know her, only for her to shun his advances after learning who he is through his best friend Jigs (Kerbie Zamora). During a street basketball game with their friends, Remington notices a mysterious flying aura in the shape of a pink scarf (a manifestation of the curse) taunting his surroundings, which briefly distracted him until a basketball hits him. In an attempt to court Hannah further, Remington volunteers himself and Jigs to help paint her newly furnished house, only for her to spurn him further after revealing that he was the same little boy who once mocked her late father for being gay, earning him the ire of her grieving mother, Mrs. Montano (Eugene Domingo). That very same night, Remington dreamt of himself and Jigs taking a bath outside their home, only to be attacked by a buffed man wielding a razor, with a butterfly tattoo on his chest. He wakes up with cuts on his legs, having lost all his body hair. His father, Ed (John Regala), notices his new look during a drinking session with his homophobic friends Suarez (Daniel Fernando) and Serge (Leandro Baldemor) and proudly declares his son as a \"real man\" who is off to court women. Meanwhile, as the murders in the barrio continue to persist, Remington tells his mother about his dream and tries helping her by identifying available suspects. Concerned, his mother asks if he might be closeted gay, to which Remington adamantly denies. His mother berates him for not wanting to go to Manila for college and asks what he truly wants in his life, to which he doesn't reply. Later that night, as another gay man gets murdered inside a beauty parlor, Remington dreamt of mistakenly boarding a tricycle thought to be Jigs', only to discover that the driver was the same strange man who attacked him in his first dream. He is instead brought to a secluded spot in the middle of the forest, where the same man paddles him and has his tongue pulled out. Eventually, Remington \"wakes up\" from this dream, only to discover that he can now speak \"gay\" and realizes that the curse from his childhood is starting to come true. Despite trying his best to hide his sexuality, however, his newfound behavior has changed Hannah and her mother's perception of him, and Hannah eventually falls for the new Remington. As the curse continues to intensify, Remington notices that his mannerisms are becoming increasingly feminine, and his wardrobe preferences are shifting. At the same time, he starts falling for his best friend Jigs, who eventually tries to seduce him but refuses to continue after learning that most of the gay men he had affairs with were murdered. Remington realizes how he is starting to lose himself and starts consulting his gay helper, Georgia (Nar Cabico), on what to do. After briefly consulting an albularyo (Marian Rivera), Remington, Hannah, and Jigs track down Pops, the mysterious drag queen who cursed him during his youth, and discover his mansion. The aged Pops initially denied putting a curse on Remington and attempted to have his pager boy shoo the trio away until Remington sees a portrait of the gay man in his house and starts calling Pops \"Bakla!\" to make him remember. Furious, Pops calls him out and confirms that he did put the curse on him, but unfortunately, he has no idea how to undo it. He, however, helps conduct a seance with the trio to communicate with the mysterious men who haunt Remington's dreams. The mysterious men manifest before them and reveal a clear solution: the only way for him to remove the curse is to find a purely heterosexual man who will choose to become gay in his place. Just as the trio, Pops and his pager boy set off to town and find possible replacements, they find themselves being blocked by the culprit of the murders: Remington's godfather, Suarez, whose \"gaydar\" gun led him to them and kills Pops. As the trio runs away from the scene, the distraught pager boy brings back his beloved master from the dead, along with the souls of other drag queens who have been murdered to exact justice, in the form of zombies, which flock to town and promptly start attacking citizens. With the time ticking, Remington, Hannah and Jigs make it to the former's birthday party, where they ask the rest of their friends if they are willing to take the curse in his place. None of them agree, in which Remington reluctantly agrees on staying that way, until Hannah snaps him out of it and retorts that real gay men continue to fight oppression due to the stigma, and that she knows he is not like this, so he doesn't have to give up being who he originally was. As the rest of the town is being attacked by gay zombies (aptly called “zombadings”, or “gay zombies”), Remington eventually meets his father, who protects him by stepping between him and Suarez. Just as Suarez is about to fire his gun, the gaydar fails, with Remington's father proudly declaring that his son is not gay, contrary to what Suarez thinks. During the ruckus, however, Serge gets attacked by zombies and dies from his injuries, prompting Suarez to cradle his cohort's body as he mourns his death. Having sensed Suarez's brief moment of affection, the gesture reactivates the gaydar gun and fires at Suarez, ending his life. Minutes before the curse takes over, Remington desperately explains to his skeptical father the nature of the curse and his current predicament. The latter asks what his son needs to undo it, and reluctantly but willingly agrees to become gay in his son's place, turning his son back to normal right before midnight. Life returns to normal in Lucban. Remington is set on leaving the town to continue his studies in Manila. Hannah, however, has finally set up the dorm she had dreamed of creating as her business. Serge and Suarez are buried under the same gravesite, while Pops and the rest of the \"zombadings\" set up a hat shop in an undisclosed park. Remington's father, however, lives a normal but pleasant life, now as an openly gay father, who also settles on eyeing passing men with his wife, and one of the men has the husband and wife agree in sync. Meanwhile, somewhere in Lucban, another tricycle stops in the middle of the street and unloads a gay man. A passing boy loudly tells his mother that he sees a gay man, which initially offends the latter, only for the kid to add that the gay man is beautiful as they part, and the film zooms out of Lucban. In the closing credits, a Bollywood-style production number in the street ensues with Remington's now-gay father (John Regala) as star attraction.",

    "plot": "In Edge City, insecure bank teller Stanley Ipkiss is frequently ridiculed by everyone except for his co-worker and best friend, Charlie Schumaker. Meanwhile, gangster Dorian Tyrell, whose boss Niko owns the Coco Bongo nightclub, plots to overthrow Niko. One day, Tyrell sends his dazzling singer-girlfriend, Tina Carlyle, into the bank to record its layout for an upcoming robbery. Stanley is attracted to Tina, and she seemingly reciprocates. After being turned away from Coco Bongo where Tina is performing, Stanley's unreliable loaner car breaks down on his way home, stranding him on the harbor bridge—there, while trying to rescue what he thinks is a person in the water, he instead discovers a wooden mask hidden beneath a pile of garbage. Upon returning to his apartment and donning the mask, he transforms into a green-faced trickster known as \"The Mask\", who can cartoonishly alter himself and his surroundings at will. With newfound confidence, Stanley indulges in a comical rampage through the city, humiliating several of his tormentors, including his temperamental landlady, Agnes Peenman, and the mechanics who gave him the faulty car. Meanwhile, Niko learns of Tyrell's plans and warns him to leave Edge City in one week or be killed. The following day, Stanley encounters Detective Lieutenant Mitch Kellaway and newspaper reporter Peggy Brandt, who are investigating the Mask's activity. To obtain the funds necessary to attend Tina's performance, Stanley dons the mask and raids the bank, inadvertently foiling Tyrell's robbery. At the Coco Bongo, Stanley dances exuberantly with Tina, whom he kisses. Tyrell soon confronts him for disrupting the theft, and Stanley flees, leaving behind a scrap of cloth from his suit, which reverts into a piece of his pajamas. After arresting Tyrell and his henchman, Kellaway finds the piece of fabric and suspects Stanley's involvement. Later, Stanley consults psychiatrist Arthur Neuman, who recently published a book called The Masks We Wear; he deduces that the mask may be a creation of Loki and its powers are only active at night. Neuman believes it is mythology, but he concludes that the Mask's personality is based on Stanley's repressed desires. That night, Stanley meets Tina at a local park as the Mask until they are interrupted by Kellaway, who attempts to capture him. Stanley flees with Peggy after he distracts the police with a mass performance of the titular song from Cuban Pete; Peggy then reluctantly betrays him to Tyrell for a $50,000 bounty. After Tyrell becomes a bulky and malevolent being when he dons the mask, he has his henchmen force Stanley to reveal the location of the stolen money before turning him in to the police along with a green rubber mask. When Tina visits Stanley at the station, he urges her to leave the city, but not before she thanks Stanley for showing her kindness and telling him that the mask was unnecessary. She attempts to flee, but Tyrell kidnaps and prepares her for the charity ball at the Coco Bongo, hosted by Niko and attended by the city's elite, including Mayor Mitchell Tilton. Upon arrival, the masked Tyrell murders Niko and prepares to destroy the club with a time bomb. Stanley's dog, Milo, helps his owner escape from his cell by retrieving the keys from the guard. Stanley sets out to stop Tyrell and takes Kellaway hostage to escape the police station. After locking Kellaway in his car, Stanley enters the club and enlists Charlie's help, but he is quickly discovered and captured. Tina tricks Tyrell into removing the mask, which is recovered and donned by Milo, who battles through Tyrell's henchmen as he and Stanley fight each other. Stanley retrieves the mask, uses its powers to dispose of the bomb seconds before it detonates and defeat Tyrell by sending him down the drain of the club's ornamental fountain; the police arrive and arrest Tyrell's henchmen. Kellaway attempts to arrest Stanley again, but Mayor Tilton intervenes, implicating Tyrell as the Mask and praising Stanley as a hero. The following day, Stanley, falsely exonerated and more secure, returns to the harbor bridge with Tina, Charlie and Milo. Tina discards the mask before she and Stanley kiss. Charlie tries to retrieve the mask, only for Milo to swim away with it.",

As James stands out as being the strongest student in a basic programming course they share, Lance approaches him initially proposing he do minimal work so no one else in the class has to work. When Lance and his friends decide they want to develop an app for hookups, he talks to James and discovers he's been coding since he was young. Lance enlists him to develop the ultimate hookup app, matching people across the campus with no strings attached. In exchange he will pay for him to transfer to an Ivy league school. James takes over their dorm room so he can work day and night on the app Jungle. The goal of the app is to connect people physically with no commitment of any kind. No numbers or names are exchanged, so the people have guaranteed one-night stands. Not wanting to be blamed for Jungle, James asks Lance to claim it as his own. Their computer science professor excuses him from having to do work in her class, as he's supposedly coding constantly.

    "title": "Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale",
    "plot": "In 1930 London, the Crawleys, except Mary, attend the three act operetta Bitter Sweet starring Guy Dexter and Noël Coward. Backstage they meet Dexter, Coward, and former Downton Abbey butler Thomas Barrow, now Dexter's assistant and partner-lover. The next day, the Crawley family is at Lady Petersfield's ball when news breaks about Mary and Henry Talbot's divorce. Lady Petersfield forces Mary to leave at once because royals are expected to attend. Robert and Cora return to Downton Abbey while Mary remains at Grantham House to receive Cora's brother, Harold Levinson, who is arriving from America following their mother Martha's death. Accompanying Harold is financial adviser Gus Sambrook, who reportedly saved Harold from financial ruin by withdrawing his investments in the stock market prior to the Wall Street Crash of autumn 1929. Sambrook and Mary are mutually attracted, drink heavily and end up in bed together. The party travels to Downton Abbey, where Harold, to Cora's dismay, reveals that he squandered their mother's fortune on poor investments. He wants to invest Downton's remaining assets to recoup his losses and repay his debt to Sambrook. Mary's divorce causes Downton neighbours to shun the Crawleys and decline a dinner invitation. Robert, still reeling from Mary's failed marriage and Harold's poor judgement, walks out when Mary proposes selling Grantham House in London to raise capital. Mary leads her family in rejecting Sambrook's proposal to invest Downton's income, prompting Sambrook to attempt to blackmail Mary over their liaison. Meanwhile, Tom Branson arrives with his daughter Sybbie. At Royal Ascot, an acquaintance informs Tom that Sambrook is a fraudster who became rich by swindling other people's fortunes and has recently avoided a lawsuit. Deducing that Sambrook embezzled the Levinson wealth, Tom warns the Crawleys and Harold. Edith confronts Sambrook and forces his retreat from the Crawleys. As Sambrook leaves, he has a final conversation with Mary, who tersely dismisses him. A remorseful Harold reconciles with Cora before returning to America. Tom and Bertie Pelham convince Robert that Mary is doing what is best for the estate. Robert agrees to entrust Downton Abbey to Mary, while he and Cora resolve to move to the Downton dower house, taking along servants John and Anna Bates. Anna is expecting a second child, and takes over as Cora's lady's maid while Baxter becomes Mary's lady's maid. With Dexter, Coward and Barrow about to visit Downton Abbey, Edith and Cora see an opportunity to rehabilitate Mary's reputation; they ask the servants to spread the news in the village. Mr Molesley, working full-time as a screenwriter, returns as a footman for the dinner, hoping Dexter and Coward will notice him. Molesley is disappointed when Dexter fails to remember him, though Coward is impressed that Molesley wrote the script for The Gambler. Molesley's spirits are lifted when, after chatting with Coward, he inadvertently provides the title for Coward's upcoming play, Private Lives, which is inspired by Mary's divorce. The dinner is a success, with Coward performing one of his songs, and the Crawleys are again viewed favourably. It is the first meal prepared by Daisy Parker; longtime cook Mrs Patmore retires after 50 years at Downton.

    "plot": "In 1928, in the quiet farming town of Earling, Iowa, a young woman named Emma Schmidt begins to suffer from terrifying and inexplicable supernatural phenomena. She is tormented by night terrors, violent outbursts, speaking in languages she does not know, and an unnatural hatred toward anything sacred. Her family, devout Catholic Christians, believes she is possessed and seek help from the Church. Their desperate plea reaches Father Theophilus Riesinger, a seasoned priest of the Capuchin religious order known for conducting exorcisms. Riesinger travels to Iowa with a reluctant companion, Father Joseph Steiger, a younger priest. Steiger is skeptical of demonic possession, haunted by his brother’s recent suicide. Yet when he meets Emma and witnesses her inexplicable actions, his skepticism begins to erode. The exorcisms take place at a convent attached to a parish church. Riesinger, who knew Emma in childhood, believes in the authenticity of the case and seeks to help her through the exorcisms, prayer, and talking. Emma is roomed upstairs and upon arrival to the church, demonstrates aversion to food that was prayed over. As the ritual begins, the house seems to change, the temperature drops, the air thickens, and Emma convulses. She begins to speak in multiple voices, some mocking and vile, others eerily calm. The demons reveal themselves as ancient unclean spirits, including Beelzebub, Judas Iscariot, and even Emma’s deceased father, a man who had abused her in life. The spirit of her aunt, rumored to have practiced witchcraft, also appears. Exorcisms are conducted over a period of 23-days, in three major stages. During the same, Emma vomits strange substances, levitates, and speaks in Latin, German, Spanish, and Aramaic. Amidst the exorcisms for Emma, Steiger continues his priestly duty of offering daily Mass in the church. However, the toll on Steiger's health is noticed by the Mother superior. Steiger slowly finds renewed purpose in helping Emma and is seen wearing his St. Michael devotional medal, which has the Saint Benedict Medal on its reverse side. During the final stage, which lasts for 72 continuous hours, Riesinger continues with intensity, while Steiger finally commits himself fully to the ritual. After Emma ran into the catacombs, the priests locate her and drive out the demons, demanding them to obey Christ. Many of the nuns at the convent simultaneously offer prayers for Emma. Then, she opens her eyes; the exorcism is complete and Emma is delivered from the demons. In the aftermath, Emma returns to a normal life, with both Riesinger being featured in the media and Steiger's journals being studied.",

The family attend an event where Noah learns that Nick has also made his own money through an app and isn't as spoiled as she thinks. Nick then takes Noah home but leaves her on the pavement after an argument involving his mother. Nick then sends his valet Zach to pick her up but Zach instead takes her to the party Nick is at. Noah watches him dance with multiple girls and throws a drink at him, irritating him. However, she is drugged from a spiked drink that she accepted and Nick saves her, before punching the guy who did it. As he takes her home, he notices an infinity tattoo that she has. Nick continues to hang out with a girl named Anna. One day, Noah receives a picture showing Haley and Dan kissing. Upset, she makes Nick take her to a car racing event that he is attending. She meets Jenna and displays her own car knowledge which is extensive due to her dad having taught her how to drive. She also meets Lion, Nick's best friend and Jenna's boyfriend. Nick finds out about the picture and offers to kiss her and picture it so that they send it to Dan for revenge. They kiss, and Noah finds out about how Nick fights and races. Nick is meant to race with Ronnie, a dangerous man, as a bet but Noah gets into the car instead. She wins, despite Ronnie trying to sabotage her, but because Nick didn't race, the bet is void meaning Nick will have to fight Ronnie. Ronnie insults Noah, leading for Nick to push him, and an aggressive fight to begin. Noah has a panic attack. At home, Noah apologises and talks about how she gets panic attacks due to violence, as well as the dark and small spaces. They nearly kiss again, and the next day Nick takes her to see Maddie.

    "plot": "In 1945, the don of New York City's Corleone family, Vito Corleone, listens to requests during his daughter Connie's wedding to Carlo Rizzi. Vito's youngest son Michael, a Marine and World War II hero who has so far stayed out of the family business, introduces his girlfriend Kay Adams to his family at the reception. Johnny Fontane, a popular singer and Vito's godson, seeks Vito's help in securing a movie role. Vito sends his consigliere, Tom Hagen, to persuade studio president Jack Woltz to offer Johnny the part. Woltz refuses Hagen's request at first, but soon complies after finding the severed head of his prized stud horse in his bed. As Christmas approaches, drug baron Virgil \"The Turk\" Sollozzo asks Vito to invest in his narcotics business to provide police protection. Vito declines, citing that involvement in narcotics would alienate his political connections. Suspicious of Sollozzo's partnership with the Tattaglia crime family, Vito sends his enforcer Luca Brasi to the Tattaglias on an espionage mission. Brasi is garroted to death during the initial meeting. Later, hitmen gun down Vito and coerce Hagen into a meeting. With Vito's first-born Sonny now in command, Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny to accept the narcotics deal. Vito survives the shooting and is visited in the hospital by Michael, who finds him unprotected after corrupt police captain Mark McCluskey, on Sollozzo's payroll, orders NYPD police officers to clear out Vito's guards. Michael stops the attempt on his father's life but is then beaten up by Captain McCluskey. After the attempted hit at the hospital, Sonny retaliates with a hit on Bruno Tattaglia. Sollozzo and McCluskey request to meet with Michael and settle the dispute. The Corleones agree to the meeting and devise a plan to plant a handgun in the bathroom of the Bronx restaurant where the meeting will be held. Michael speaks with Sollozzo for several minutes then excuses himself, retrieves the gun, and shoots both men dead. Despite a clampdown by the authorities for the killing of a police captain, the Five Families erupt in open warfare. Michael takes refuge under the protection of Don Tommasino in Sicily, and Vito's second son Fredo is sheltered by Jewish mobster Moe Greene in Las Vegas. In Sicily, Michael meets and marries a local woman, Apollonia. Sonny publicly attacks and threatens Carlo for physically abusing Connie. When he abuses her again, Sonny speeds to their home but is ambushed and murdered by gangsters at a highway toll booth. Apollonia is killed shortly thereafter by a car bomb intended for Michael. Devastated by Sonny's death and tired of war as the capo dei capi, Vito sets up a meeting with the Five Families. He assures them that he will withdraw his opposition to their narcotics business and forgo avenging Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay. They have two children in the early 1950s. With his father nearing the end of his life and Fredo not suited to lead, Michael assumes the position of head of the Corleone family. Vito tells Michael that he now knows that their true adversary had been Don Barzini all along. He warns him that Barzini would try to kill him at a meeting organized by a traitorous Corleone capo. With Vito's support, Michael relegates Hagen to managing operations in Las Vegas as he is not a \"wartime consigliere\". Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Moe Greene's stake in the family's casinos and reprimands Fredo for defending Greene, whom Barzini had turned against the family. In 1955, Vito dies of a heart attack while playing with Michael's son Anthony. At Vito's funeral, Tessio asks Michael to meet with Barzini, signaling his betrayal. The meeting is set for the same day as the baptism of Connie's baby. Michael, remembering his father's warning, deduces the plot and Tessio is led off to be murdered. While Michael stands at the baptismal font as the child's godfather, Corleone hitmen murder the dons of the four other families as well as Greene for not selling his hotel. Michael extracts Carlo's confession that he had conspired with Barzini on Sonny's assassination. He assures Carlo that he is being exiled, not murdered. However, Clemenza strangles Carlo in a car shortly afterwards. Connie confronts Michael about his involvement in Carlo's death while Kay is in the room. Kay asks Michael if he ordered Carlo's death, which Michael denies, leaving Kay relieved. As she leaves, capos enter the office and pay reverence to Michael as \"Don Corleone\".",

    "plot": "On her 50th birthday, now-faded Hollywood film star Elisabeth Sparkle is dismissed from her long-running aerobics TV show by its producer, Harvey, due to her age. Elisabeth crashes her car while distracted by a billboard of herself being taken down. At the hospital, a young male nurse gives her a flash drive advertising \"The Substance\", a black market drug that promises a \"younger, more beautiful, more perfect\" version of oneself. Elisabeth orders The Substance and injects the single-use serum. She convulses as a younger woman, Sue, emerges from a slit in her back. The two bodies must switch consciousness every seven days without exception, with the inactive body remaining unconscious and fed intravenously. Daily injections of stabilizer fluid, extracted from the original body, are required to prevent Sue from deteriorating. Sue becomes an overnight sensation after auditioning as Elisabeth's replacement, and is offered by Harvey to host the New Year's Eve show. While Sue lives a confident and hedonistic life, Elisabeth becomes a self-hating recluse. Near the end of one weekly cycle, Sue brings a man home for casual sex; she delays the switch by extracting additional stabilizer fluid, causing Elisabeth's right index finger to rapidly age. Elisabeth contacts the supplier, who warns that delaying the switching schedule will lead to irreversible, rapid aging of the original body. Elisabeth and Sue gradually become separate personalities and begin to hate each other; Elisabeth resents Sue's frequent disregard of the switching schedule, causing further aging, while Sue is appalled by Elisabeth's descent into unhealthy binge-eating. Following a particularly destructive episode as Elisabeth, Sue stockpiles stabilizer fluid and refuses to switch back. Three months later, on the day before the New Year's Eve show, Sue runs out of stabilizer fluid and contacts the supplier, who informs her she must switch back to replenish the fluid. When they switch, Elisabeth finds herself transformed into a deformed, hag-like hunchback. To stop Sue aging her further, Elisabeth orders a serum designed to terminate her. However, Elisabeth, still craving Sue's celebrity status, stops before fully injecting the serum and resuscitates Sue, leaving both of them conscious. Realizing Elisabeth's initial intent, Sue beats Elisabeth to death before leaving to host the New Year's show. Without Elisabeth, Sue's body rapidly deteriorates. She attempts to create a new version of herself using the leftover serum, despite the single-use warning. This results in the creation of a grotesque mutated body, \"Monstro Elisasue\", with both Elisabeth and Sue's faces. Wearing a mask cut from a poster of Elisabeth, Monstro Elisasue attempts to host the show, but the audience erupts into chaos when her disguise falls off. An audience member decapitates her, only for an even more mutated head to grow back, and one of her arms breaks and drenches the audience and studio in blood. Fleeing the studio, Monstro Elisasue collapses and explodes into viscera. Elisabeth's original face detaches from the gore, crawling onto her neglected star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She smiles as she hallucinates being admired before melting into a puddle of blood, which is cleaned up by a floor scrubber the next day.",

    "plot": "David King is a New York City music mogul, considered to have the \"best ears in the business\" and the founder of Stackin' Hits Records. Having once sold his majority interest in the company, King intends to buy back majority ownership to avert a buyout by a rival label. To regain majority ownership, King offers to buy out one of his two partners’ shares. To raise the cash for the deal, he puts up most of his personal assets, including his Dumbo penthouse home and impressive collection of art by contemporary Black artists, as collateral. The day the deal is to go through, King receives an anonymous call from a kidnapper, demanding $17.5 million in Swiss 1,000-franc notes for the safe return of his son Trey. King immediately contacts the police and agrees with his wife Pam to pay the ransom, even though it risks the cash he needs for his business deal. However, Trey is soon found safe as the kidnapper has mistakenly taken Kyle, Trey's best friend and the son of King's driver and confidant Paul Christopher. The kidnapper still demands the money in exchange for Kyle's life. Despite King's earlier willingness to ransom his own son, he is reluctant to do the same for Kyle. Paul and Trey both plead with King to save Kyle. King's partner warns that failing to do so will hurt the company's image. After a long night of soul-searching, King agrees to pay the ransom. Following the kidnapper's instructions, King packs the money in an Air Jordan backpack, which the police mark with a GPS tracker, goes to Brooklyn's Borough Hall subway stop, and gets on a train to Yankee Stadium. Near the stadium, the kidnapper calls King and orders him to go between the train cars. Then an accomplice triggers the emergency brake, the train jerks to a halt, and the bag falls between the cars and through the ironwork of the elevated line to the street. Another accomplice of the kidnapper, riding a moped, catches it, and the bag is subsequently handed off between additional accomplices on mopeds several times as they make their escape through the nearby Puerto Rican Day Parade. When the police manage to catch the bagman, the money has already been removed. Kyle is released in a nearby park. King's actions have made him a hero to the public, and several songs by Stackin' Hits are climbing the charts. Still, King's lenders for the $17.5 million say he must pay them back in two weeks, or they will begin seizing the collateral he used to secure the loan as it would be considered fraud since the money was agreed to only be used for the buy out. Their reason is that King broke the terms of their contract by using the money to pay Kyle's ransom instead of for purchasing shares of Stackin' Hits. Kyle is unable to identify his kidnapper, but recalls hearing a distinctive hip-hop track while he was captive. King, listening to a playlist of demo tracks that Trey usually puts together for him to listen to, recognizes the song and realizes that the artist, Yung Felon, must be the kidnapper. The police dismiss this lead, so King and Paul, both armed, track down Yung Felon's address themselves. King meets his wife and infant son. She tells him that Felon is an ex-convict and aspiring rapper who idolizes King. Believing he wants to sign Felon to his label, Felon's wife directs King to his recording studio, where he confronts Felon. In an impromptu rap battle, Felon explains that he saw King as a father figure and resorted to the kidnapping plot after being ignored by him for years. A gunfight breaks out and Felon flees onto a nearby elevated subway train. King chases him to the platform and onto the train, finally catching Felon between cars and knocking him unconscious. Meanwhile, the detectives locate King's money at Yung Felon's apartment. King offers Paul a chance to be part of the new label. Paul, who has injured his left eye in the gunfight with Felon, says that it's time for him and his son to do something new. Yung Felon, who has become the most-streamed musical artist in the world, takes a plea deal, accepting a 25-year prison sentence, in return for King meeting him face-to-face. When they meet, Felon tries to convince King to sign him, saying that they both will make a lot of money. King reveals that he has left Stackin' Hits Records to create a new, smaller label, and rejects Felon, who explodes in anger and disappointment. Back at their penthouse home, King, Pam, and Trey audition Sula, a young singer-songwriter discovered by Trey. Her performance of her song \"Highest 2 Lowest\", wows the Kings, who offer to sign her to their new label.",

    "title": "The Shawshank Redemption",
    "plot": "In 1947, Portland, Maine, banker Andy Dufresne arrives at Shawshank State Prison to serve two consecutive life sentences for murdering his wife and her lover. He is befriended by Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding, a contraband smuggler serving a life sentence, who procures for him a rock hammer and a large poster of Rita Hayworth. Assigned to work in the prison laundry, Andy is frequently raped by \"the Sisters\" gang, led by Bogs Diamond. In 1949, Andy overhears the captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being taxed on an inheritance and offers to help him shelter the money legally. After the Sisters beat Andy to near-death, Hadley cripples Bogs, who is subsequently transferred to a minimum security hospital; Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton assigns Andy to the prison's decrepit library, ostensibly to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen, but in reality, to utilize Andy's financial expertise in managing the warden's and other prison staff's finances. Andy also starts writing weekly letters to the state legislature, requesting funding to improve the library. Brooks is paroled in 1954 after serving 50 years, but cannot adjust to the outside world and eventually hangs himself. After years of Andy's ceaseless letters, the legislature sends a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro; Andy plays an excerpt over the public address system, experiencing a moment of personal freedom before he is punished with solitary confinement. After his release, Andy explains to a dismissive Red that hope is what gets him through his sentence. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving bribes. Andy launders the money using the alias \"Randall Stephens\". In 1965, Andy and Red befriend Tommy Williams, a young inmate convicted of burglary. Andy helps Tommy pass his General Educational Development exam, and Tommy later reveals that his cellmate at another prison confessed to committing the murders for which Andy was convicted. When Andy informs Norton, the warden refuses to act. Although Andy promises to keep the money laundering a secret, Norton has Hadley kill Tommy under the guise of an escape attempt and sends Andy to solitary confinement. Norton then threatens to destroy the library, strip Andy of guard protection, and transfer him to harsher conditions if he refuses to continue with his scheme. A dishevelled Andy is released from solitary confinement after two months. He tells a skeptical Red that he dreams of living in Zihuatanejo, a town on the Mexican Pacific coast, where he can start anew. He asks Red to promise, once he is released, to travel to a specific hayfield near Buxton and recover a package that Andy buried there. Red worries that Andy is suicidal, especially after learning that he asked a fellow inmate for a rope. At the next day's roll call, the guards find Andy's cell empty. An irate Norton throws a rock at a poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the cell wall, revealing a tunnel that Andy had dug with his rock hammer over 19 years. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and prison sewage pipe, taking with him Norton's suit, shoes, and the ledger containing evidence of the money laundering and corruption at Shawshank. While guards search for him, Andy poses as Randall Stephens and withdraws over $370,000 of the laundered money from various banks, before mailing the ledger to a local newspaper. State police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest. The following year, Red is paroled after serving 40 years, but struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears that he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter inviting him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole by traveling to Mexico, admitting that he finally feels hope. He finds Andy on a beach, and the reunited friends happily embrace.",

    "plot": "In 1996, aboard the research vessel Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, treasure hunter Brock Lovett and his team explore the wreck of RMS Titanic, hoping to find a necklace known as the Heart of the Ocean. Instead, they recover a safe containing a drawing of a young woman wearing the necklace. The sketch is dated April 14, 1912, the day the Titanic struck an iceberg and sank, resulting in about 1,500 deaths. After seeing a television report about the discovery, centenarian Rose Dawson Calvert contacts Lovett, revealing herself as the woman in the drawing. Hoping she can help locate the necklace, Lovett brings Rose and her granddaughter aboard the Keldysh, where Rose recounts her experience as a Titanic passenger. In 1912, 17-year-old Rose DeWitt Bukater boards the Titanic in Southampton with her wealthy fiancé, Cal Hockley, and her mother, Ruth, who stresses that Rose's marriage to Cal will resolve their financial problems. However, Rose is unhappy in the loveless engagement. Feeling trapped, Rose contemplates suicide by jumping from the ship's stern, but is stopped by Jack Dawson, a poor nomadic artist. Jack and Rose form a friendship, and Jack confesses his growing feelings for her. Though initially resistant, Rose realizes she has fallen in love with Jack, despite Cal's and Ruth's disapproval. Rose brings Jack to her stateroom and asks him to draw her nude wearing only the necklace. Afterward, they evade Cal's valet, Spicer Lovejoy, and have sex in a car in the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness the ship's collision with an iceberg and overhear officers discussing the severity of the situation. When Cal discovers Jack's sketch of Rose and a mocking note she left, he arranges to frame Jack for theft by having Lovejoy plant the necklace on him. Jack is arrested and locked in the master-at-arms' office, while Cal places the necklace in his own coat pocket. As the ship begins sinking, women and children are prioritized for the lifeboats. Rose finds and frees Jack, and they return to the deck, where Cal urges Rose to board a lifeboat, claiming he and Jack will board another. He unwittingly wraps his coat, containing the necklace, around her. However, as her lifeboat is lowered, Rose jumps back onto the sinking ship, unwilling to leave Jack behind. Enraged, Cal grabs a pistol and chases them through the flooding ship, but gives up when they escape. Cal manages to secure a place on a lifeboat by pretending to be a child's father. As the ship's flooded bow sinks, the stern rises into the air, and Jack and Rose cling to the railing. The ship splits in two, and the stern sinks into the freezing water with the remaining passengers. Jack helps Rose onto floating debris and makes her promise to survive and live a full life. Jack dies from hypothermia, but Rose is saved by a returning lifeboat, and later rescued by the RMS Carpathia. Rose remains hidden from Cal and her mother, and gives her name as Rose Dawson on her arrival in New York City. In the present, Rose reveals that Cal committed suicide after losing his fortune in the 1929 stock market crash. She tells the Keldysh crew that Jack saved her in every possible way, and laments that her memories are all that she has left of him. Touched by her account of the Titanic, Lovett abandons his search for the necklace. Alone at night on the stern of the Keldysh, Rose, who has kept the necklace in her possession all along, drops it into the sea above the wreck. Later, as she lies in her bed, photographs on her dresser depict a life of freedom and adventure inspired by Jack. Aboard the pristine and undamaged Titanic, a young Rose reunites with Jack at the Grand Staircase, applauded by the passengers and crew who died in the sinking.",

    "plot": "When his car is clamped, David visits the peculiar \"Car Rental Company\" and finds himself in a bizarre audition. He is given the only model of car offered, a 1994 Saturn SL with a special GPS. Driving to a friend's wedding, David is introduced to Sarah, who is uninterested in marriage or relationships, while David, who emigrated from Ireland as a teenager, reveals his childhood dream was becoming a husband and father. He declines to dance with her, a decision he soon regrets, and she spends the night with someone else. Driving home, the GPS convinces David to embark on a \"big, bold, beautiful journey\", and directs him to a rest stop Burger King where he runs into Sarah. Despite their flirtation, she remains pessimistic about relationships. Ready to go their separate ways, they discover they both rented cars from the unusual company. When Sarah's car refuses to start, David's GPS instructs him to pick her up, and they set off on their journey together. The GPS guides them to their first stop, a mysterious door in the woods. Stepping through, they find themselves in a lighthouse in Canada, which David once visited. They return to the car and reach their next strange door, which Sarah recognizes as the back entrance to her favorite art museum. Inside, they explore the paintings she often visited with her mother, who died when she was in college. Back in the car, Sarah remembers an enjoyable road trip with her estranged father, and believes she is unable to stop herself from hurting people. Their next destination is a greenhouse where they find the doors to David's high school. Inside, David relives a day as his fifteen-year-old self, starring in the school production of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, with Sarah and his parents in the audience. He confesses his feelings for a costar and relives her rejection, but derails the show by confronting her onstage with hard truths about the future. Sarah joins the musical number instead, as the entire auditorium sings her and David on their way. Driving into the night, Sarah urges David not to pursue her. The car suddenly stops, and they find themselves in a black box theater with the doors to a hospital. Inside, Sarah confronts her guilt at sleeping with her college professor instead of being with her mother, who died at the hospital alone. While Sarah grieves at her mother's bedside, David comforts his own father, who is anxious about the premature birth of his son. Driving off with presents from the gift shop, Sarah changes clothes in the backseat as David reveals his mother briefly left the family when he was a child, and they agree that life can feel too short. Taken to a mountain overlook where they gaze out over the entire planet, David and Sarah imagine having gone to the wedding together, and share a kiss. They arrive at a door on a roadside billboard, which leads to a café; David is confronted by his former fiancée to explain himself for ending their engagement, while Sarah is faced with an ex-boyfriend she suddenly abandoned. Each is forced to admit their romantic failings, and return to the road only to hit a deer, but they escape unharmed while the car is destroyed. Sarah suggests they end the journey before they can hurt each other. David tells her he loves her, but she insists they are only experiencing a fantasy. They spend a lonely night at the nearby Timely Inn, and the car is fixed. David drops Sarah off at her car and they part ways, but are each taken to their childhood homes. As his own father, David comforts his fifteen-year-old self, while Sarah relives a happy night with her mother as a twelve-year-old. David returns the car, amusing the Cashier and Mechanic by suggesting they are matching customers with their soulmates. Changing her mind, Sarah arrives at David's address and declares that she loves him. They kiss, and walk together through the front door.",

When her roommate, Kate Kavanagh, catches a cold and is unable to interview Christian Grey, a twenty-seven year old billionaire entrepreneur, for the college newspaper, Ana agrees to take Kate's place. At Christian's Seattle headquarters, she stumbles her way through the meeting. Christian, who is that year's WSU commencement speaker, takes an interest in her, and she in him. Soon after, he visits the hardware store where Ana works and offers to do a photo shoot to accompany the article for which she had interviewed him. Christian asks Ana out for coffee, but leaves abruptly after she confesses to being a romantic, saying he is not the man for her. He later sends her first edition copies of two Thomas Hardy novels, including Tess of the d'Urbervilles, as a gift, with a quote from the latter book about the dangers of relationships on an accompanying card. Ana and her friends celebrate graduation at a local bar. After drinking too much, she calls Christian, saying she is returning the books, and berating him for his behavior towards her. He goes to the bar to find her, arriving just as her photographer friend, José Rodriquez, attempts to kiss her against her will. Ana, suddenly sick, throws up and passes out. The next morning, she wakes up in Christian's hotel room, relieved that nothing sexual happened between them. After the two make out in an elevator, and he takes her for a ride in his helicopter, a romance starts to develop. He insists, however, that she sign a non-disclosure agreement preventing her from revealing details about their relationship. He explains that he is a dominant who engages in sexual bondage relationships, but only as defined in a contract between the participants. Ana reveals that she is a virgin. While considering the agreement and negotiating her own terms, and after briefly visiting his \"Red Room,\" a place stocked with a bed and a variety of whips and shackles, she and Christian spend the night together. The next morning, after making pancakes and meeting Christian's adoptive mother, the two go for a drive, during which Christian explains that he was introduced to his dominant practices at age fifteen by a woman Ana dubs \"Mrs. Robinson\". His parents know nothing about this, even though \"Mrs. Robinson\" was and still is a friend of the family. Christian bestows a series of gifts and favors upon Ana, including a new car and a laptop. After she and Kate move to Seattle, he insists that she go over his contract before moving forward. After looking into it in some detail, Ana initially says no, but is persuaded otherwise and finds herself willingly giving her consent. During dinner at his parents' home, Ana suddenly mentions she is leaving the next day to visit her mother in Georgia. This makes Christian angry, especially when she says she wants more than the one-sided relationship he's proposing. She then goes to Georgia, visits a lounge for cocktails, and is shocked when Christian shows up. He meets her mother, takes her air gliding, then returns to Seattle to tend to a business emergency. After returning home, Ana and Christian have a night in his \"Red Room\". She consents to what he wants, but he remains emotionally distant, upsetting her. While still considering the contract, and in an effort to understand Christian's psychology, Ana asks him to demonstrate the worst punishment he would inflict on her for rule-breaking. He whips her with his belt, making her count each stroke out loud. Crushed, she declares her love for him, but says his behavior is unacceptable. He replies that he is too screwed up to have the relationship that she wants. Devastated and depressed, Ana leaves Christian, and he promises to send her a check for the car he sold without her consent. As he goes after her, Ana orders him to stop. Christian tries to plead with her, saying her name, and Ana cuts him off by saying his own name, turning his plea into a farewell as the elevator doors close.",

An \"eternal bachelorette\", she maintains she will either die alone or marry someone wealthy. Despite her professional success, Lucy grows frustrated with her clients' increasingly unrealistic standards. Her long-term client Sophie is struggling to lower her standards and settle while Lucy consoles her over her recent rejection. Lucy attends a former client's wedding, the ninth she has been responsible for. The bride is crying, feeling she is marrying for shallow reasons and out of obligation, but Lucy ultimately persuades her to proceed with the ceremony. At the wedding reception, Lucy is approached by financier Harry Castillo, the groom's brother, who overhears Lucy's business pitch to other singles at the party. He shows interest in her, but she rebuffs him, suggesting instead that he become an Adore client. Also at the wedding is Lucy's ex-boyfriend John Pitts, who is working as a cater-waiter and continues to pursue acting. They reminisce about their past relationship, which ended due to differing financial aspirations. Harry persists in courting Lucy, taking her to upscale restaurants. She initially questions his interest, believing he could find a better partner, but he reassures her that his interest is genuine. Their relationship becomes official, and Lucy's renewed optimism translates to her work life; Sophie's latest match Mark tells Lucy that he enjoyed the date with Sophie and wants to see her again. Lucy's confidence is shaken when her boss, Violet, informs her that Sophie is suing Adore because Mark assaulted her after the date. Violet tells Lucy that the situation was out of her hands, orders her to take four weeks off to clear her mind and instructs her not to contact Sophie due to the lawsuit. Despite Violet's warning, Lucy tracks Sophie down and personally apologizes. Sophie angrily rejects the apology, calling her a \"pimp\" who was looking to pawn off a problem client on any man she could, regardless of the consequences. She storms off, further increasing Lucy's guilt. Preparing to travel to Iceland with Harry, Lucy finds an engagement ring in his luggage. Later that night, she discovers he had undergone a $200,000 tibial lengthening surgery to increase his height. Adamant that the procedure changed his life for the better, he asks her if it changes her feelings for him.

At a wedding they gatecrash together, she kisses him. When John asks if they are getting back together, Lucy expresses uncertainty, citing her conflicted values. John confesses he has always loved her and envisions a future together despite his insecurity for not being able to provide the relationship she wanted, while Lucy admits that her dissatisfaction with John's financial situation overshadowed their love when they were together and assumes that John hates her, which he denies. Lucy receives a panicked call from Sophie; Mark is outside her apartment and the police are refusing to intervene since he has not broken in. Lucy and John rush back to the city, finding that Mark has already left. Lucy helps Sophie file a restraining order and they reconcile.

    "plot": "In the Land of Oz, Glinda the Good joins the citizens of Munchkinland as they celebrate the death of the Wicked Witch of the West at the hands of a \"female child\". When a child asks her why wickedness happens, Glinda relays the Witch's backstory - born from an affair between the wife of then-Governor Thropp, Melena, and a mysterious traveling salesman, the Witch was ostracized from birth due to her unnaturally green skin (a result of the green elixir the salesman intoxicated Melena with), and her telekinetic powers, which she inadvertently uses when she experiences any strong emotion (\"No One Mourns the Wicked\"). When asked if she and the Witch were friends, Glinda reveals that they knew each other from school. Years earlier, Elphaba Thropp arrives at Shiz University to see off her wheelchair-using younger sister, Nessarose (\"Dear Old Shiz\"). After witnessing an accidental release of Elphaba's powers Shiz's Dean of Sorcery Studies Madame Morrible offers to enroll and privately tutor Elphaba in sorcery. Elphaba accepts, hoping that it will allow her to accomplish her dream of working with Oz's ruler, the Wonderful Wizard of Oz, and having him change her skin color (\"The Wizard and I\"). To the discontent of both, Elphaba is forced to room with the bubbly, popular Galinda Upland, with whom she clashes constantly (\"What Is This Feeling?\"). One night, Elphaba follows history professor Dr. Dillamond, an anthropomorphic goat who faces discrimination as one of Shiz's last Animal professors, to a meeting of animals off-campus. Dillamond reveals that other animals are losing their ability to speak, but Elphaba assures him the Wizard will fix it (\"Something Bad\"). Rebellious transfer student Fiyero Tigelaar takes a group of students to a party at the Ozdust Ballroom nightclub (\"Dancing Through Life\"). Galinda convinces her admirer Boq Woodsman, a happy-go-lucky Munchkin, to invite Nessarose so she can accompany Fiyero. Moved by this, Elphaba convinces a begrudging Morrible to tutor Galinda. Elphaba arrives at the Ozdust and is ridiculed for wearing a pointed hat that Galinda gave her as a joke. Galinda remorsefully dances with her (\"Ozdust Duet\"), later repaying her kindness with a makeover (\"Popular\"). Dillamond announces that animals are no longer allowed to teach at Shiz and is forcibly removed from his classroom. His replacement, the unscrupulous Professor Nikidik, demonstrates a new contraption - a cage containing a frightened lion cub, designed to prevent animals from learning to speak. Enraged, Elphaba releases her powers and spins poppy dust over the room, rendering everyone except herself and Fiyero asleep. They escape campus and release the cub into the forest. After sharing a moment, Elphaba laments her unrequited feelings for Fiyero (\"I'm Not That Girl\"). The Wizard invites Elphaba to meet him, having learned of her powers from Morrible. Galinda, now calling herself \"Glinda\" in honor of Dillamond's mispronunciation of her name, accompanies her. They arrive in the Emerald City (\"One Short Day\") and are introduced to the Wizard, who is an ordinary man (\"A Sentimental Man\"). Morrible arrives to witness Elphaba and the Wizard's meeting. At their urging, Elphaba casts a levitation spell from the sacred Grimmerie spellbook that makes the Wizard's monkey guards painfully sprout wings. As the Wizard and Morrible rejoice over their newfound ability to use the monkeys as spies, Elphaba realizes that they are the ones behind the animals' oppression and that the fraudulent Wizard, lacking any real magic of his own, used her to further subjugate them. Horrified, Elphaba steals the Grimmerie and flees. Glinda follows Elphaba and implores her to reconcile with Morrible and the Wizard, but Elphaba refuses. Glinda supports her, but declines to accompany her. The two share an emotional farewell before Glinda is apprehended by guards. Elphaba repeats the levitation spell on a broom and escapes the city. Morrible sends out warnings to the citizens of Oz, deeming Elphaba a \"wicked witch\" and demanding she be found and apprehended. Fiyero leaves Shiz on horseback amidst a mass evacuation while Governor Thropp suffers a heart attack after he and Nessarose receive the news. Elphaba flies west, leaving Glinda behind (\"Defying Gravity\").",

On the way to work one day, she is almost attacked by a loose dog until a young man calms it down and returns it to its owner. He turns out to be Samuel, an intern at Romy's company who picks her as his \"mentor\" through the company's mentorship program. Samuel propositions Romy during a private meeting; she initially objects, but gives in and kisses him. Conflicted about the incident, the two later meet at a hotel. Romy expresses concern that she may be taking advantage of Samuel due to their power imbalance, but Samuel retorts that he is the one with the power, as he could get her fired \"with one phone call.\" The two have a sexual encounter with Samuel playing the role of a dominant partner, resulting in Romy having an intense orgasm after which she sobs with deep conflict about her enjoyment of this experience. The two continue to meet at multiple rendezvous, their sexual affair gaining considerable intensity. Samuel continues to push boundaries. In one instance, he appears at Romy and Jacob's country home, ingratiating himself with the entire family under the pretense of returning a laptop Romy left at the office. Feeling disrespected, Romy lashes out at Samuel and orders him to never show up at her home again. In the ensuing argument, Samuel threatens to request a transfer to a different department, which Romy objects to, fearing she will be questioned about her role in his transfer request. As her stress continues to build, Romy eventually admits to Jacob that she has never experienced an orgasm with him. Desperate, she meets with Samuel to convince him to continue their affair. He agrees after Romy confirms her submission to him. Soon afterward, Samuel appears at her house uninvited again for her daughter Nora's birthday party, having been brought by Esmée, Romy's executive assistant who he is dating. Esmée informs Romy that she knows about her affair with Samuel and implores her to end it, as she is one of the few high-ranking women in the company and needs to remain a respectable role model. Romy later confesses the affair to Jacob, but is dishonest about the nature of her and Samuel's relationship, instead describing it as a one-night stand with a stranger. She attempts to express her sexual needs to Jacob, but he is too distraught over her infidelity to listen. Romy retreats to their country house, where Jacob later arrives to find her talking with Samuel. A fight breaks out between the two men. After the fight winds down, Jacob says that female masochism is a mere neurosis or male construct, but Samuel calls this a dated idea, causing Jacob to suffer a panic attack. Samuel calms Jacob down with an embrace, then leaves. Encouraged by her teenage daughter Isabel, Romy decides to reconcile with Jacob. A board member informs Romy that Samuel has taken a new job in Japan. He asks if she had anything to do with Samuel leaving, implying that he knows about the affair, and invites her to his house. Disgusted, Romy firmly states that she is unafraid of him and orders him out. A while later, Romy and Jacob have rekindled their romance and sex life. At home, they reenact the type of rough sex that Samuel introduced to Romy, and she climaxes while imagining Samuel playing with the dog that attacked her in the hotel room that Romy and Samuel shared earlier in the film.",

    "plot": "Seventeen-year-old Bella Swan leaves Phoenix, Arizona and moves to Forks, a small town located on Washington state's Olympic Peninsula, to live with her father, Charlie, the town's police chief. Her mother, Renée, is remarried to Phil, a minor league baseball player. Bella becomes re-acquainted with Jacob Black, a Native American teen who lives with his father, Billy on the Quileute Indian Reservation near Forks. At school, she finds the mysterious and aloof Cullen siblings particularly intriguing. She is seated next to Edward Cullen in biology class, but he seems repulsed by her. When Bella is nearly struck by a van in the school parking lot, Edward instantaneously covers a distance of over thirty feet to put himself between her and the van, stopping it with only his hand. He refuses to explain his actions to her, warning her against befriending him. Jacob tells Bella about a long-standing animosity between the Cullens and the Quileutes; the Cullens are not allowed on the reservation. When Edward saves Bella again, this time from a gang, after research she concludes that he is a vampire. He eventually confirms this, explaining that he found her scent irresistible back in biology class and that the Cullens only consume animal blood. The pair fall in love and he introduces her to his vampire family. Carlisle Cullen, the patriarch, is a doctor at the Forks Hospital. Esme is his wife, and Alice, Jasper, Emmett and Rosalie are their informally-adopted children. The family's reaction to Bella is mixed, as some of the Cullens are concerned that the family's secret could be exposed. Edward and Bella's relationship is jeopardized when three nomadic vampires—James, Victoria, and Laurent—arrive, responsible for a series of deaths being investigated as animal attacks. James, a tracker vampire, is excited by Bella's scent and becomes obsessed with hunting her for sport. The Cullens protect Bella from the trio. Laurent chose to warn the Cullens about James, who in turn attempt to draw James away from Bella, but James manages to track her to Phoenix. She is there hiding with Jasper and Alice, and James tricks her into thinking he kidnapped her mother by luring her into her old ballet studio. James revealed the kidnapping was a ruse as he attacks Bella, infecting her with vampire venom. The Cullens arrive and kill James, decapitating and burning him, as Edward removes the venom from Bella's wrist, preventing her from becoming a vampire. In the aftermath, Edward accompanies an injured Bella to prom, where he refuses her request to transform her into a vampire. They are unaware that James' mate, Victoria, is watching them, plotting revenge for her lover's death.",

    "plot": "The story opens in Los Angeles, California, where an armored-truck robbery leaves two guards and a bystander dead, which sets off a series of events told in four acts. A Dark Spirit Five months after the opening scene's robbery, Patrick Hill joins Fortico Security as an armored truck guard. His manager, Terry, commends his references, and company trainer \"Bullet\" nicknames him \"H\". Hill barely passes firearm training and gets off to a rocky start with his colleagues, including “Boy Sweat” Dave and Dana Curtis. During a pickup, Bullet is taken hostage and Hill convinces a panicked Dave to comply with the robbers before he disposes of the entire crew with expert marksmanship and merciless efficiency. Hill is questioned by FBI agents investigating the first robbery. The FBI investigators bring their suspicions about Hill to their superior, Agent King, who tells them to leave Hill alone. Hill receives a dossier of Fortico employee files and an autopsy report from the opening scene's murder. Three months later, Hill and Bullet become the targets of a new heist. They are waylaid in their truck in Chinatown, but the robbers flee at the sight of Hill. Hill continues to investigate his coworkers and they become increasingly suspicious of him. Scorched Earth The act opens as a flashback. Five months before joining Fortico, on the day of the opening scene's robbery, Hill is present with his son Dougie. Revealed to be a thief himself, who was working with a robbery crew, Hill grudgingly agrees to monitor an armored truck's route, leaving Dougie in the car. A different group of robbers hijacks the truck and spots Dougie. Hill races back to his son and watches as Dougie is murdered before he is also shot and left for dead. Three weeks later, Hill wakes up in the hospital and meets with Agent King, who gives him a list of suspects and agrees to temporarily turn a blind eye. Hill is revealed to be Mason Hargreaves, a notorious crime lord; he is promised that he will be allowed to avenge Dougie's death and summarily kill the robbers if he can bring down all of them at once. Accordingly, and determined to find Dougie’s killer, Hargreaves and his men – led by Mike, Brendan, and Moggy – kill nearly every thief on King's list of known armored-truck burglars, without results. Mike voices his concerns about retaliation, and Hargreaves agrees to lay low in London, but actually lied. He instead assumes the identity of Patrick Hill and joins Fortico to continue the hunt alone. It was Hargreaves' own crew who attempted the Chinatown robbery until Mike recognized Hargreaves. Bad Animals, Bad Some time before the opening scene's robbery, a group of disgruntled Afghanistan veterans – Carlos, Sam, Brad, Tom, Jan, and their former sergeant Jackson Aisley – decide to become thieves. Their first robbery results in $110,000. With help from an unidentified guard who served under Jackson, they decide to pull off a more ambitious heist of an armored truck. This robbery is the robbery seen at the start of the film. During this Fortico heist, Jan needlessly shoots the guards, as well as Dougie and Hargreaves. Hargreaves, as he is shot, sees Jan's face. Liver, Lungs, Spleen & Heart Five months later, the veterans reunite to steal close to $180 million from the Fortico facility on Black Friday weekend. Bullet, still believing Hargreaves' cover story, reveals to Hargreaves that he is Jackson's inside man—this connects him to the murder and confirms Hargreaves' suspicions that he helped kill Dougie—threatening him into cooperating. The crew takes the depot hostage, but an alarm is triggered; during the chaos, the hostages from the Fortico staff revolt and mortally wound Jackson. The gang, including Bullet, then slaughters the majority of the Fortico staff, though Hargreaves manages to kill all of the robbery crew except Jan, Bullet, and Jackson. The three escape, but in greed, ultimately all attempt to turn on each other at once, with Jan murdering the other two. At home, Jan finds a phone in one of the money bags, planted by Hargreaves to track its location, when Hargreaves calls it. Hargreaves confronts him with Dougie’s autopsy report and slowly reads it aloud. Dougie was shot in the liver, both lungs, the spleen, and finally, in his heart. In his final act of vengeance, Hargreaves reciprocates each wound, shooting him in the same parts of the body that Jan shot Dougie. Abandoning the money, Hargreaves tells King his task is done and drives away.",

    "plot": "19-year-old Linnéa, working under the stage name \"Bella Cherry\", is a girl from a small town in Sweden who travels to Los Angeles in the hopes of becoming a famous porn star. Under the guidance of her manager, she begins to navigate the challenging world of the porn industry, determined to achieve more significant roles and video views by pushing herself beyond personal boundaries and limits. Bella shares a house with a group of other young aspiring actresses, and though she is standoffish and private at first, she eventually bonds with one of her housemates, Joy, who supports Bella and helps her build her brand. At a party, the girls spot Mark Spiegler, one of the most successful and demanding agents in the porn industry; he is joined by Ava, one of the biggest names in the local porn scene. Bella starts a conversation with Ava, but does not get past pleasantries. Joy tries to flirt with a famous male actor, Caesar, but when he rejects her, she retaliates by pushing him into the pool. Bella works on several shoots, including a BDSM scene with a female director who encourages Bella in positive, healthy ways, enforcing safety and consent on the set. However, Bella, determined to push herself further, requests hardcore scenes from her manager. While filming a rape scene with two male actors, she becomes overwhelmed and breaks down, repeatedly interrupting filming. Her co-stars and the director are initially supportive, but they quickly grow hostile and impatient when she struggles to finish the scene. Bella reluctantly agrees to complete the shoot and later confronts her manager, who reminds her that she requested harder material. Upset, Bella fires him as her manager. Now working independently, Bella attempts to acquire Spiegler as her new manager, but he turns her down, citing her weak social media following and insisting that he only accepts actresses willing to do extreme scenes. In order to prove herself, Bella participates in an unpaid interracial threesome, in which she engages in double-anal penetration (which Bella later points out has never been done before in the industry) despite having never previously shot an anal sex scene, thus boosting her following considerably. Spiegler is impressed and agrees to hire Bella. As a way to repay her friend, Bella requests that Joy be part of her next scene. Joy is initially thrilled, but hesitates when the lead actor withdraws at the last minute and is replaced by Caesar. Bella implores Joy to go through with the shoot, but soon observes Caesar harassing Joy off-camera. During the scene, which involves degradation and humiliation, Caesar begins to legitimately abuse Joy, who stops the scene in anger. Joy insists to the director that Caesar is harming her, but when she asks Bella to confirm Caesar's earlier harassment, Bella, worried about her reputation, balks. Furious, Joy upbraids Bella for her betrayal and storms off the set. Bella is given a chance to film a scene with Ava, but Ava humiliates her when she refuses to perform oral sex on Bella, claiming she has a yeast infection. The scene is changed so that Bella will penetrate Ava with a strap-on, but Bella quickly lets her anger and frustration take over, acting violently and aggressively towards Ava without warning or consent, just as many of her male co-stars and directors did to her since her arrival. When Bella tries to apologize to Ava later en route to a party, Ava nonchalantly dismisses her as if nothing had bothered her, which disturbs Bella. Bella is further disillusioned when she spots her former housemates at the party, all of whom are enjoying themselves—unlike Bella, who is now essentially restricted to the VIP area. On the ride back from the party, Bella abruptly asks the car to stop so she can exit.",

    "title": "Oppenheimer",
    "plot": "In 1926, 22-year-old doctoral student J. Robert Oppenheimer grapples with anxiety and homesickness while studying experimental quantum physics under Patrick Blackett at the University of Cambridge in England. Oppenheimer clashes with Blackett, leaving him a poisoned apple, but he later retrieves it. Visiting scientist Niels Bohr advises Oppenheimer to study theoretical physics at the University of Göttingen in Germany. Oppenheimer completes his PhD and meets scientist Isidor Isaac Rabi. They later meet theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg in Switzerland. Wanting to expand quantum physics research in the United States, Oppenheimer teaches at the University of California, Berkeley and the California Institute of Technology. He marries Katherine \"Kitty\" Puening, a biologist and ex-communist, and has an intermittent affair with Jean Tatlock, a troubled communist psychiatrist whose death appears to be a suicide. When nuclear fission is discovered in 1938, after the Germans succeed in splitting the atom, Oppenheimer realizes it can be weaponized. In 1942, during World War II, U.S. Army Colonel Leslie Groves, the director of the Manhattan Project, recruits Oppenheimer as the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory to develop an atomic bomb. Oppenheimer fears the German nuclear research program, led by Heisenberg, might yield a fission bomb for the Nazis sooner. Oppenheimer assembles a team consisting of Rabi, Hans Bethe, and Edward Teller, and collaborates with the scientists Enrico Fermi, Leo Szilard, and David L. Hill at the University of Chicago. Teller's calculations reveal an atomic detonation could destroy the world; after consulting with Albert Einstein and having Bethe do his own calculations on the matter, Oppenheimer concludes the chances are \"near zero\". Teller attempts to leave the project after his proposal to construct a hydrogen bomb is rejected, but Oppenheimer convinces him to stay. After Germany's surrender in 1945, some scientists question the bomb's relevance. Oppenheimer believes it would end the ongoing Pacific War and save lives. The Trinity test is successful, and President Harry S. Truman orders the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, resulting in Japan's surrender. Though publicly praised, Oppenheimer is guilt-ridden and haunted by the destruction and mass fatalities. After Oppenheimer expresses his remorse to Truman, the president accepts responsibility for ordering the bombings, but also berates him and dismisses his plea to cease further atomic development. As an advisor to the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), Oppenheimer's stance generates controversy, while Teller's hydrogen bomb receives renewed interest amidst the burgeoning Cold War. AEC Chairman Lewis Strauss resents Oppenheimer for publicly dismissing Strauss's concerns about exporting radioactive isotopes and for recommending negotiations with the Soviet Union after the Soviets successfully detonate their own bomb. Strauss also believes that Oppenheimer denigrated him during a conversation Oppenheimer had with Einstein in 1947, though he had in fact expressed his belief that he had caused a chain reaction that would one day destroy the world. In 1954, wanting to eliminate Oppenheimer's political influence, Strauss secretly orchestrates a private security hearing before a Personnel Security Board concerning the renewal of Oppenheimer's Q clearance, during which his loyalty to the United States is questioned. However, the hearing is a kangaroo court. Oppenheimer's past communist ties are raised and his associates' testimony is twisted against him, with Teller's being the most damaging. After Kitty vigorously defends herself and her husband, the board no longer suspects Oppenheimer of disloyalty but still revokes his clearance, thereby damaging his public image and limiting his influence on American nuclear policy. In 1959, during Strauss's Senate confirmation hearing for Secretary of Commerce, Hill unexpectedly testifies about Strauss's personal motives for engineering Oppenheimer's downfall. Strauss's nomination is narrowly voted down, with the deciding vote against Strauss given by the Senator of Massachusetts, John F. Kennedy, enraging him. In 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson presents Oppenheimer with the Enrico Fermi Award.",

    "plot": "On their fifth wedding anniversary, writing teacher Nick Dunne returns home to find his wife Amy missing. Amy's fame as the inspiration for her parents' successful Amazing Amy children's books ensures widespread press coverage. The media finds Nick's apathy towards the disappearance suspicious. Flashbacks in the form of diary entries show a complex reality and a deteriorating marriage. Amazing Amy was an idealized completion of the real Amy's failures. Both Nick and Amy lost their jobs in the recession and moved from New York to Nick's hometown of North Carthage, Missouri, to support his dying mother. Nick grew distant from Amy and began an affair with Andie, one of his students, while Amy became resentful towards Nick for uprooting her. Detective Rhonda Boney and the forensic team find poorly concealed evidence of a struggle and profuse blood loss in the house. Boney learns of financial issues, spousal disputes, and Amy's recent attempt to buy a gun. Medical reports indicate Amy was pregnant, which Nick denies knowledge of. On every wedding anniversary, Amy had set up elaborate treasure hunts for Nick. This year's clues appear in places where Nick had sex with Andie, thus revealing Amy's knowledge of his affair. Nick discovers thousands of dollars of items purchased with his credit card hidden in his twin sister Margo's woodshed. Amy's clues lead authorities to a half-burned diary documenting her growing dread of Nick and ending with a genuine fear that he will kill her. It is revealed that Amy is alive and hiding in a campground in the Ozarks. After discovering Nick's affair, Amy conceived an elaborate plan to frame him for her murder. She had him ramp up her life insurance and secretly used his credit card to buy the woodshed items. She befriended a pregnant neighbor, told her stories about Nick's temper, and stole her urine to fake a pregnancy, thus eliciting media sympathy after her disappearance. She wrote a diary with increasingly fabricated entries and placed incriminating evidence in the treasure-hunt spots for the police to find. On the morning of her disappearance, Amy drained and splattered her own blood across the kitchen and then cleaned it haphazardly. Her original plan was to drown herself after Nick's arrest and have her body found to ensure his death sentence. Nick deduces Amy's scheme, convinces Margo of his innocence, and hires lawyer Tanner Bolt, known for representing husbands suspected of murdering their wives. Nick meets two of Amy's ex-boyfriends: Tommy O'Hara claims he was framed for rape by her after he ended their relationship; wealthy Desi Collings, against whom Amy had filed a restraining order for stalking, turns Nick away. When Amy's campground neighbors rob her, she calls Desi for help, convincing him that she fled Nick's abuse. Desi agrees to hide her in his lakehouse. Bolt convinces Nick to reveal his affair on a popular talk show, thus seizing the narrative initiative from the media. Andie reveals the affair at a press conference shortly before the show, but Nick insists on conducting the interview. He affirms his innocence and feigns regret for his shortcomings as a spouse, knowing that Amy will be watching. The interview is a success, garnering widespread sympathy for Nick. However, Boney has already gathered enough murder evidence and arrests Nick and Margo. Bolt bails them out, and they brace for the impending trial. After watching Nick's interview, Amy rekindles her attraction to him and spends weeks crafting her escape story. Using lakehouse surveillance cameras and self-inflicted wrist and vaginal injuries, she makes it appear that Desi kidnapped and raped her. She then seduces Desi, slits his throat during sex, and returns home covered in his blood, thus clearing Nick of suspicion. Medical examiners lend credence to Amy's story. During questioning, Boney probes her inconsistencies, but Amy spins the focus onto Boney by calling her incompetent. The FBI believes Amy and closes the case, but Boney gleans Amy's guilt. Upon returning home, Amy tells Nick the truth, admitting to Desi's murder. She states that Nick pleading for her return on TV is the one she wants and the one who inspired her forgiveness. Nick shares this with Boney, Bolt, and Margo. Despite unanimously agreeing that Amy is guilty, everyone acknowledges a lack of evidence. Bolt wishes Nick well and returns to New York. A televised interview takes place in their home seven weeks later. Anticipating Nick's intention to leave her and publicly expose her story, Amy reveals her pregnancy minutes before the interview, having inseminated herself with Nick's sperm from a fertility clinic. Nick reacts violently at first but feels responsible for the child and ultimately decides to stay with Amy, despite Margo's despair. The \"happy\" couple announces on television that they are expecting a child.",

One morning, Aria expresses frustration over her inability to bathe herself and tells Janiyah that her teacher said she couldn't afford lunch. Though visibly upset, Janiyah focuses on getting to work. As she leaves, Janiyah gives spare change to Benny, a neighbor in a wheelchair, prompting her landlord to threaten eviction unless rent is paid by 10:00 a.m. After dropping Aria off at school, Janiyah goes to her grocery store job, where a family throws a glass bottle at her after she refuses to process a WIC transaction for ineligible items. Her unsympathetic boss, Richard, orders her to clean up the mess. While in the back room, a friend who pities her attempts to help by offering her some money, but Janiyah refuses. During her shift, Janiyah receives a call from the school reporting that Aria has sustained injuries, requesting her presence. Janiyah tries to explain they occurred during a seizure in the bathtub, but the school insists she comes over. Richard refuses to let her leave, furious that she always makes up excuses, and threatening to fire her if she doesn't return within 30 minutes, and refuses to pay her check when she politely asks. She rushes to the bank to withdraw lunch money for Aria but is delayed by a long line. When she finally arrives at the school, she is confronted by the principal and Child Protective Services, who question her ability to care for the child and take Aria into custody despite her pleas. Driving back to work in the rain, Janiyah accidentally cuts off an off-duty police officer, who retaliates by throwing a drink at her and forcing her off the road. Responding officers impound her car due to expired documents. When she returns to her job, Janiyah is fired, and Richard again refuses to issue her paycheck. Upon arriving home, she finds she has been evicted and her belongings discarded. Janiyah returns to the store to confront her boss. While there, two armed robbers enter, where one addresses her by her name written on her name tag; one demands Aria's backpack, and when Janiyah refuses, she is assaulted. In the struggle, she grabs a gun and fatally shoots one of the robbers while the other one escapes. Despite explaining that the robber knew her name from her tag, Richard accuses her of staging the robbery and calls 911. He ruthlessly adds that he'll like to see what sort of parent she'll make from prison, upon which she shoots and kills Richard, then flees with her paycheck. At the bank, a teller refuses to cash her check without proper identification, pushing Janiyah to pull out the gun in desperation. The teller complies, but a silent alarm is triggered. The bank manager, Nicole, recognizes Janiyah and attempts to calm her. Meanwhile, Detectives Raymond and Grimes, already investigating the earlier incident at the store, are alerted to the robbery. Raymond, a former Army negotiator, speaks to Janiyah over the phone and gradually establishes a rapport. Meanwhile, inside the bank, a teller secretly livestreams the standoff, drawing public sympathy. When Janiyah discovers that the security cameras are on, she immediately demands that they switch them off. Nicole and Janiyah work together to disable the bank's cameras. Meanwhile public support for Janiyah grows as the citizens rally outside demanding the police authorities \"free Janiyah\". Janiyah is triggered and frustrated by the science project her daughter made, which looks like her bomb, and attempts to turn it off much to the panic and fear of the hostages in the bank. Janiyah realizes the confusion regarding the science project and demands that Nicole calls Detective Raymond and tell her the item in the backpack wasn't a bomb, but Nicole suggests otherwise, insisting that the \"bomb\" was the only thing stopping the police from storming into the bank. Meanwhile, another teller, Tessa, writes a message on a bathroom window revealing that the supposed “bomb” in Aria's backpack is actually a science project. Detective Raymond identifies and confronts the off-duty officer who harassed Janiyah, and has him detained. When the FBI refuses to let Janiyah confirm his identity directly, Raymond sends Nicole in with a photograph. Janiyah confirms the officer's identity and releases the hostages, though Nicole chooses to stay with her. Janiyah then receives a phone call from her mother, who reminds her that Aria died the night before from a seizure. A flashback reveals that Aria's presence throughout the day was a hallucination, and the earlier phone call from the school and the visit from Child Protective Services never occurred. Nicole, aware of Aria's death, remained to support and protect Janiyah. As the FBI prepares to storm the bank, tear gas is fired and Janiyah hallucinates being shot. In reality, she peacefully surrenders to Detective Raymond, with Nicole at her side.",

The police release Alex to his aunt, Holly. Convinced of Alex's guilt, Keller Dover, the father of Anna, assaults him outside the police station, where Alex whispers to him, \"They didn't cry 'til I left them.\" After Loki finds no proof of this, Keller kidnaps Alex and takes him to an empty building Keller owns. With the reluctant help of Joy's father, Franklin Birch, Keller begins to torture Alex for information about their daughters. Franklin's wife Nancy convinces Franklin to stop, but the pair decide not to stop Keller or alert the police. At a vigil for the girls, Loki approaches a suspicious man who flees. Loki releases a sketch of him to the community. The suspect sneaks into the Birch and Dover houses. Grace, Keller's wife, hears him and calls Loki. He tails Keller to the empty building, where Keller claims he goes to drink, but Loki does not find Alex. Loki arrests the suspect, Bob Taylor, at his house. The walls are covered in maze drawings and Loki opens crates filled with snakes and bloody children's clothes. Loki shows Keller and the Birch parents photos of the bloody clothes, and they identify several as Joy's and Anna's. As Taylor draws detailed mazes, Loki assaults him, demanding the location of the girls. Taylor grabs an officer's gun and kills himself. Keller continues torturing Alex, who cryptically talks about a maze. Keller visits Alex's aunt Holly, learning that Alex's stuttering stems from a childhood accident involving snakes her husband kept. Holly and her husband lost their faith after their son died of cancer, and adopted Alex as a way to cope. Loki matches the maze pattern in Taylor's drawings to a necklace depicting a maze worn by the corpse in Dunn's house. At Taylor's house, Loki is informed that most of the bloody clothes are store-bought and soaked with pig blood. Below a window outside the Dover house, Loki finds Taylor's footprints and a sock matching Anna's. The drugged Anna and Joy attempt to escape, but only Joy succeeds and is hospitalized. Joy remembers little, but when questioned by Keller, tells him, \"You were there.\" He immediately rushes out. Loki gives chase and arrives at Keller's building, finding Alex. Keller goes to Holly's to find Anna and Holly pulls a gun. She explains that before the disappearance of her husband (implied to be the corpse in Dunn's basement), they abducted children as part of their war on God to avenge their son's death, and to create demons out of the traumatized parents. Alex was their first abduction, and Taylor was their second. Holly imprisons Keller in a hidden pit in her yard, where he finds his daughter's whistle. Loki enters Holly's house and finds a photo of her late husband wearing the maze necklace. Realizing that Holly is the kidnapper, he finds her giving Anna an injection. In a shootout, Loki is grazed by a bullet and responds by shooting Holly in the face, killing her. He rushes Anna to the hospital while fighting unconsciousness. The next morning, a recuperating Anna and Joy visit Loki in his hospital room to thank him. Later, Loki wanders the crime scene at Holly's house, when he faintly hears a whistle blowing.",

A man and his son give flyers displaying the picture of a missing woman (their daughter and sister Mar) to the attendants to the dance party. A subgroup of ravers tell the man and the boy (Luis and Esteban) that another rave is taking place afterwards deeper into the desert and that the missing woman perhaps could be there. A group of soldiers dissolves the rave and order Europeans to be evacuated. The ravers (Stef, Jade, Tonin, Bigui, and Josh) escape from the convoy line in two vans, and Luis and Esteban follow them in their smaller van together with their dog Pipa. Radio reports that armed conflict between two countries has started. The ravers try to dissuade Luis and Esteban from following them but they insist. Heading south to a location \"close to Mauritania\", the enlarged group shares mishaps and bonds closer, including Luis paying for the ravers' fuel, Pipa falling ill (reportedly because of having eaten feces contaminated by LSD), the group crossing a river with their vehicles, the group sharing food and fuel, and Tonin improvising a musical number while his leg stump performs a sort of puppetry show. A radio broadcast reports that World War III is taking place. While crossing a mountain pass, one of the vans gets stuck. The group fixes the vehicle but Esteban and Pipa fall off a cliff while waiting behind in Luis's compact van and die. The remaining group members drive further into the desert looking for help, coming across a nomadic herder who does not pay them attention. Meanwhile, a shocked Luis walks into the desert alone. He is rescued by Jade and Stef. The group uses a psychoactive drug and improvises a rave in the desert with two loudspeakers because Jade thinks it could make some good at the moment. They dance. While in a trance, Jade steps on a land mine and dies. Tonin dies by stepping on another mine while approaching Jade. Realizing they have stepped into a minefield, the remaining group members are determined to reach a presumably mine-free rocky area nearby. They use a van with no driver to try to secure a mine free path to the rocky area. The van explodes by hitting a mine. They repeat the same operation with the second van, which also hits a mine, and changes direction before exploding, as it activates a second mine, failing to create a safe path to the rocky area. Unfazed, Luis successfully walks a straight line into the rocky area. Bigui follows him and dies. Stef and Josh follow suit with their eyes shut, reaching Luis' destination. Stef, Josh, and Luis are seen crossing the desert on the roof of a train along with other people.",

    "plot": "In April 1945, during the Western Allied invasion of Germany, Don \"Wardaddy\" Collier, a battle-hardened US Army Staff Sergeant in the U.S. Second Armored Division, commands an M4A3E8 Sherman nicknamed Fury, whose crew—consisting of gunner Boyd \"Bible\" Swan, loader Grady \"Coon-Ass\" Travis, driver Trini \"Gordo\" Garcia, and assistant driver–bow gunner \"Red\"—have been together since the North African campaign. After Red is killed in action he's replaced by Private First Class Norman Ellison, formerly a typist clerk. The crew disdains Norman for his lack of combat experience and aversion to violence. As their tank column advances, Norman spots but does not fire on concealed Hitler Youth, who ambush the lead tank with a Panzerfaust, killing the platoon leader and his crew. Don furiously blames Norman for their loss, and assumes command of the column. Norman hesitates again during an assault on a tree line against infantry and anti-tank guns. After the battle, Don orders Norman to execute a captured German soldier. When he refuses, Don wrestles his revolver into Norman's hand and forces him to pull the trigger, killing the soldier and traumatizing Norman. After capturing Kirchohsen, Don and Norman find two German women, Irma and Emma, hiding in an apartment. Don has the women prepare them a meal and supply hot water for a shave. Seeing Norman speaking with the teenaged Emma, Don orders Norman to take Emma into the bedroom or he, Don, will. Norman does so and has sex with her. Later, during dinner, Fury's crew drunkenly enters, harassing the women and bullying Norman, leading to a standoff with Don before the unit is ordered to move out. While Captain Waggoner briefs Don on their next mission, German artillery strikes the town, killing Emma, Waggoner and other US soldiers. Norman suffers a breakdown. Don's tank platoon is ordered to seize and hold a vital crossroads to protect the division's vulnerable rear. A lone German Tiger I ambushes and destroys the other three tanks before being defeated by Fury which loses its radio in the battle. Unable to call for reinforcements Don decides to continue the mission alone. Fury is immobilized by a landmine at the crossroads. Norman is sent to scout and spots a Waffen-SS battalion approaching. The crew opts to leave until Don insists on staying with the immobilized tank. Norman elects to stay and convinces the others to stay also. The men disguise Fury to appear knocked out and assume their positions to make a last stand. Exchanging Bible verses, Norman earns the nickname \"Machine\" as a show of the crew's newfound support. Fury ambushes the Waffen-SS battalion which takes heavy casualties. During the ensuing skirmish, Grady is killed by a Panzerfaust shot that penetrates the turret. Gordo is shot in the turret, dropping a live grenade inside the tank and sacrificing himself by shielding it with his body. While trying to give Don grenades, Bible is shot in the head by a camouflaged sniper, who then wounds Don. Out of ammunition and surrounded, Norman contemplates surrendering, but Don directs him to escape through the floor hatch as the Germans drop grenades into the tank. Norman hides underneath the tank as the grenades kill Don, and is then spared by a young Waffen-SS soldier who spots him under the tank but chooses not to alert his comrades. Norman crawls back into the tank the next morning and covers Don's corpse with his jacket, before being discovered by an infantry unit. He is then helped to an ambulance by medics and praised as a hero for his actions, and watches an American column advance past Fury's wreck, surrounded by dozens of dead Waffen-SS soldiers.",

Ana is annoyed when she openly flirts with Grey. She later threatens to fire Gia if she keeps it up, forcing her to stop. When Christian is away on a business trip, Ana disregards his wishes that she stay at home, and meets her friend, Kate Kavanagh, for a drink. Kate is dating Christian's older brother Elliot and fears he may be having an affair with Gia, his business associate. Jack Hyde attempts to kidnap Ana when she gets home. Ana's new security team subdues him, and he is arrested. After arguing with Christian about her night out with Kate, Ana berates him for being controlling and possessive, demanding more freedom. He later surprises her with a trip to Aspen, bringing along Kate, Elliot, Mia, and José. Elliot proposes to Kate, who accepts. It is revealed that Gia was only helping him choose the ring. The newlyweds continue with their sexual experimentation, but it becomes complicated when Ana announces she is pregnant. Christian is disturbed, as he had other plans for their early years together. He leaves, going on a night-long drunken bender. After he returns, Ana discovers that Christian had texted and met his ex-lover, and former BDSM dominant, Elena Lincoln, who had groomed him as a minor. Angry, she locks herself in the playroom for the night. He searches for Ana in the morning and they continue arguing, with Ana telling Christian how important the baby is to her. Shortly after, Hyde is released on a $500,000 bond and phones Ana, demanding a ransom of $5 million in cash in two hours. He threatens to kill Mia, Christian's abducted sister, if his demands are not met. Ana must not tell anyone and bring the money alone.

The following morning, he finds a picture of a young woman on the ground just before a mortar attack destroys where he had been sitting, killing many around him. Unsuccessful at finding the photo's owner, he keeps it. Logan's squad-mate declares the woman in the picture his \"guardian angel,\" just before an explosion destroys their Humvee. Logan returns to Colorado to live with his sister's family, who have been looking after his dog Zeus. Suffering from PTSD and survivor guilt, he decides it is best to leave and departs to search for the woman in the photo. Logan and Zeus walk to Louisiana, where a lighthouse in the photo has provided a clue. He shows the photo around town and a local resident tells him that the woman used to be married to his friend, a local deputy sheriff. Logan finds the woman, Beth Green, but has difficulty explaining why he is there. She assumes he wants a job, and her grandmother, Ellie, who hires him. At first, Beth is irritated by Logan's presence, but she begins to warm to him due to his calm demeanor, willingness to work, and competence in repairing machinery. Logan develops a supportive relationship with Beth's son Ben, who is without a positive male influence since the death of Beth's brother Drake. Beth's former husband, Sheriff's Deputy Keith Clayton—the son of the town's judge—is immediately suspicious of Logan. He is brusque and overbearing with the former Marine. As he discourages his son Ben from playing the violin around him, it leads the boy to practice in his tree house. When Ben returns bloodied from a charity baseball game, Beth and Keith have an argument, and he threatens to use his connections to take full custody of the boy. She is anxious about Keith's short temper and is fearful of losing her son to him. On the anniversary of Drake's death, Beth becomes distraught and Logan calms her down. Keith tries to stop the budding relationship between Beth and Logan, but she stands up to him, showing that she is no longer intimidated by him. Discovering that Logan was asking about Beth when he first arrived in town, Keith steals the photo, making her believe that Logan has been stalking her. Her trust destroyed, she is distraught and sends Logan away. Ellie tries to soften Beth, explaining it isn't Logan's fault he survived and Drake did not. An intoxicated Keith sees Logan walking with his dog and angrily confronts him, drawing his gun while people on the street begin to panic and run. Logan disarms him, turning the weapon over to another officer. He then heads home to pack, finding a photo of Beth's brother Drake inside a book Ben had given him. The tattoo on Drake's forearm says \"Aces\" and he realizes that Drake was the sergeant from the night raid. Logan returns to Beth's to tell her what he knows of how Drake died. At Judge Clayton's, Keith is shocked and embarrassed over what he did, although his father assures him it will all blow over before the election. Keith walks out into a gathering storm, leaving his badge behind, pleading to Beth to reconcile. When she gently but firmly refuses, he again threatens to take Ben away. Ben overhears and runs out into the storm, followed by Keith and Beth, just as Logan arrives. Ellie urges Logan to follow.

    "plot": "In 1941, Austrian SS-Standartenführer Hans Landa interrogates French dairy farmer Perrier LaPadite about a fugitive Jewish family, the Dreyfuses. He boasts his nickname, \"The Jew Hunter,\" then offers LaPadite amnesty if he will give up the Dreyfuses. LaPadite tearfully admits that they are hiding under his floor. Landa's men massacre the Dreyfuses, but one of them, young Shosanna, escapes unharmed. Three years later, U.S. Army lieutenant Aldo Raine recruits Jewish-American soldiers to the \"Basterds,\" a black ops commando unit tasked with instilling fear among Nazis in occupied France by killing and scalping them. The group includes Sergeant Donny \"The Bear Jew\" Donowitz, privates first class Smithson Utivich and Omar Ulmer, rogue German sergeant Hugo Stiglitz, and Austrian-born translator Corporal Wilhelm Wicki. Raine leaves a swastika mark on surviving German soldiers so they can't hide their Nazi affiliations after the war. Shosanna now operates a cinema in Paris under the name Emmanuelle Mimieux and meets Fredrick Zoller, a famed German sniper set to star in the German propaganda film Stolz der Nation (Nation's Pride). Infatuated with \"Emmanuelle,\" Zoller convinces Joseph Goebbels to hold the film's premiere at her cinema. Landa, the premiere's head of security, interrogates Shosanna but doesn't reveal if he recognizes her. She plots with her Afro-French lover and projectionist, Marcel, to kill the German leaders by burning down the cinema with her collection of highly flammable nitrate films. British Commando Lieutenant Archie Hicox, a former film critic and fluent German speaker, is recruited for Operation Kino, an attack on the premiere with the Basterds. Disguised as German officers, Hicox, Stiglitz, and Wicki meet with German film star Bridget von Hammersmark, an undercover Allied agent, in an occupied town at a tavern unexpectedly full of German soldiers. Hicox's unusual accent arouses suspicion from Wehrmacht sergeant Wilhelm and SS Sturmbannfühurer Dieter Hellström, who joins Hicox's group when his suspicions are aroused. Hicox and Hammersmark convince him they are genuine, but Hicox blows their cover with a non-German hand gesture. Everyone is killed in the ensuing gunfight except Wilhelm and a wounded von Hammersmark. Raine negotiates with Wilhelm for von Hammersmark's release until she shoots Wilhelm dead. Believing she set his men up, Raine tortures von Hammersmark, but she convinces him of her loyalty and reveals Hitler is attending the premiere. Raine decides the mission needs to go ahead with himself, Donowitz, and Ulmer to attend posing as Italian filmmakers. Von Hanmersmark is doubtful but thinks the Germans won't find their Italian accents suspicious. Landa investigates the tavern and finds von Hammersmark's shoe and a napkin with her signature. The Basterds infiltrate the premiere with timed explosives. Landa, fluent in Italian, sees through their cover and confronts von Hammersmark privately, strangling her to death. He has Raine arrested along with Utivich, whom he has also detected, but leaves Ulmer and Donowitz in the theater. Taking advantage of the situation, Landa offers to let the attack proceed if Raine's OSS commanders will guarantee his safety after the war. Raine contacts his commanders, and Landa negotiates a generous deal for himself and his radio operator. During the screening, Zoller confronts Shosanna in the projection booth, and they shoot each other dead. As Nation's Pride reaches its climax, Shosanna's face appears on the screen telling the Nazi audience that they are about to be killed by a Jew. Having locked the auditorium, Marcel ignites a pile of nitrate film behind the screen, setting the theater ablaze. Ulmer and Donowitz break into the opera box, gun down Hitler and Goebbels, and fire into the panicked crowd until the explosives demolish the cinema. Landa and his radio operator drive Raine and Utivich into Allied territory, where they surrender to Raine. Raine shoots the radio operator and triumphantly carves a swastika into Landa's forehead, declaring it to be his masterpiece.",

However, during the proceedings, she learns over a phone call that Mahesh has abandoned her for the daughter of a wealthy businessman, prioritizing his career over their relationship. Devastated, Vaani faints and subsequently withdraws into depression, isolating herself for months and abandoning her passion for writing. Krish Kapoor, an aspiring musician struggling to establish himself, copes with childhood trauma and anger through music. Prone to emotional outbursts, he faces setbacks in his career, including clashes with journalists and disputes with his band members. His friend KV supports the band financially, despite the strain it places on his own education. Krish encounters Vaani when he returns her poetry notebook she accidentally left while applying for a job as a writer at a publishing house where he assaults a journalist, and is immediately drawn to the honesty and depth of her work. Though initially hesitant about Krish's erratic nature, Vaani agrees to collaborate with him on a song for hip-hop singer Prince. When she experiences creative difficulties, Krish discovers torn pages from her notebook, recognizing her inner struggles. To help her, he takes her to a cricket playground, a place of solace for him. Inspired by his focus, Vaani gradually resumes writing. Their collaboration grows into a friendship as they spend more time together, with Vaani regaining her confidence and Krish finding stability in her presence. Their bond deepens after Krish confronts his alcoholic father, with whom he became estranged after his mother's death. Vaani comforts him by opening up about her own heartache, and later encourages him to admit his father into rehabilitation. After completing their project, on which Krish is forced to cede all credit to pay for his father's rehab, he distances himself, believing Vaani deserves better. However, they soon reunite at Prince's concert, acknowledging their feelings for each other, and begin an intimate relationship. Krish reconciles with his band, and he and Vaani continue working together. Vaani's parents grow concerned upon witnessing Krish's closeness to their daughter, fearing he may hurt her as Mahesh once did. The stress causes Vaani to collapse again, after which her mother questions Krish at the hospital about his intentions. When he promises commitment, her parents reluctantly approve of the relationship. The couple's lives change dramatically when Vaani is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Signs of memory loss become apparent, including a public breakdown during an encounter with Mahesh after he acquires Vaani's workplace.

Back at their guesthouse, Krish's father reconciles with him, urging him not to repeat his mistakes. In a quiet moment, Krish plays a tune on the piano. Vaani loves it and offers to write the words.

    "title": "Good Will Hunting",
    "plot": "Twenty-year-old Will Hunting of South Boston is a self-taught math genius who was recently paroled after completing a prison term. He works as a janitor at MIT, and spends his free time drinking with his friends Chuckie, Billy and Morgan. When Professor Gerald Lambeau posts a difficult graph theory mathematics problem on a blackboard as a challenge for his graduate students, Will solves the problem anonymously, stunning both the students and Lambeau. As a challenge to the unknown genius, Lambeau posts an even more difficult problem. He later catches Will writing the solution on the blackboard late at night, but initially thinks Will is vandalizing it and chases him off. At a bar, Will meets Skylar, an English woman about to graduate from Harvard, who plans on attending medical school at Stanford. Meanwhile, Lambeau, realizing Will was not vandalizing the problem but solving it, asks the campus maintenance staff his whereabouts, but is informed he did not turn up for work. Lambeau learns Will was placed at MIT by a parole program, and obtains his parole officer's details. Will and his friends start a fight with a gang that includes a member who used to bully Will as a child. Will is arrested after he attacks a responding police officer. Lambeau sits in on his court appearance and watches Will defend himself. He arranges for Will to avoid jail time if he agrees to study mathematics under Lambeau's supervision and participate in psychotherapy sessions. Will agrees but treats his therapists with mockery. In desperation, Lambeau calls on Dr. Sean Maguire, his college roommate, who now teaches psychology at Bunker Hill Community College. Unlike the other therapists, Sean actually challenges Will's defense mechanisms. During the first session, Will insults his deceased wife, and Sean threatens him, but after a few unproductive sessions, Will finally begins to open up. Will is particularly struck by Sean's story of how he met his wife, who later died of cancer, by giving up his ticket to the historic game six of the 1975 World Series after falling in love at first sight. Sean's explanation for surrendering his ticket was to \"see about a girl\", and he does not regret his decision. This encourages Will to build a relationship with Skylar, though he lies to her about his past and is reluctant to introduce her to his friends or show her his home. Will also challenges Sean to take an objective look at his own life, since Sean cannot move on from his wife's death. Lambeau sets up a number of job interviews for Will, but he scorns them by sending Chuckie as his \"chief negotiator\", and by turning down a position at the NSA with a scathing critique of the agency's moral position. Skylar asks Will to move to California with her, but he refuses and tells her he is an orphan, and that his foster father physically abused him. Will breaks up with Skylar and later storms out on Lambeau, dismissing the mathematical research he has been doing. Sean points out to Will that he is so adept at anticipating future failure in his interpersonal relationships that he deliberately sabotages them to avoid emotional pain. Chuckie likewise challenges Will over his resistance to taking any of the positions he interviews for, telling him he owes it to his friends to make the most of opportunities they will never have, even if it means leaving one day. He then tells Will that the best part of his day is the brief moment when he waits at his doorstep, thinking Will has moved on to something “greater”. Will walks in on a heated argument between Sean and Lambeau over Will's potential. Lambeau leaves, and Sean and Will talk and it comes to light that they were both victims of child abuse. Sean helps him see that he is a victim of his own inner demons and to accept that the abuse he received was not his fault by repeatedly stating, \"It's not your fault\", causing him to break down in tears in Sean's arms. Will accepts one of the job offers arranged by Lambeau. Having helped Will manage his problems, Sean reconciles with Lambeau, deciding to take a sabbatical. Will's friends give him a used car for his 21st birthday so he can commute to work. Later, Chuckie goes to Will's to pick him up, only to find that he is not there, much to his happiness, as Will had finally done what Chuckie had been wishing for all these years. Will leaves a note for Sean asking him to tell Lambeau that he had to go \"see about a girl\", revealing he instead chose to reunite with Skylar, much to Sean's approval.",

Miami drug lord Frank Lopez arranges green cards for them in exchange for killing a former henchman for Fidel Castro. Dissatisfied with their jobs as restaurant dishwashers, Tony and Manny meet with Frank's right-hand man Omar Suarez, who sends the four to purchase cocaine from Colombian dealers. Tony and Angel are taken at gunpoint; Tony is forced to watch as Angel is dismembered with a chainsaw, before Manny and Chi-Chi rescue them. They kill three of the dealers and deliver the drugs and money to Frank in person, suspecting that Omar set them up. Frank hires Tony and Manny and they start working for him. Tony notices Frank's trophy wife Elvira and starts becoming attracted to her. One night, Tony visits his mother and sister Gina. Tony gives his mother $1,000, claiming he earns money as a political organizer. However, Tony's mother sees through his lie, berates him for his criminal lifestyle, refuses his money and kicks him out. Gina however keeps the money. Manny is attracted to Gina but Tony warns him to stay away from her. Frank sends Tony and Omar to Bolivia to meet cocaine kingpin Alejandro Sosa. Omar is angered at and argues with Tony when he tries negotiating a large deal without Frank's approval. Sosa sends Omar off, but keeps Tony behind and has Tony witness his men hang Omar from a helicopter. Sosa tells Tony that Omar was a police informant and Frank has poor judgment for trusting Omar. Tony says that he never liked and trusted Omar. Sosa takes a liking to Tony and agrees to the deal, whilst warning Tony not to betray him. Back in Miami, Frank is furious at Tony for his unauthorized deal with Sosa and for Omar's demise. Tony and Frank sever their business ties, as Tony now sets up his own cocaine operation and continues his advances on Elvira, further infuriating Frank. Mel Bernstein, a corrupt detective on Frank's payroll, attempts to extort Tony for police protection. While at a club, Tony finds Gina using cocaine with a man in a bathroom stall and assaults them both, then escapes an attempt on his life by two hitmen. He confronts Frank and Bernstein over the attack, forcing Frank to confess that he set it up, then has Manny shoot Frank dead and kills Bernstein himself. Tony marries Elvira and becomes the distributor of Sosa's product, constructing a large, heavily guarded estate to oversee his rapidly growing empire. In 1983, Tony is caught in an FBI sting operation and charged with money laundering and tax evasion. Sosa offers to keep Tony out of prison via his government connections if Tony assists in the murder of a journalist about to expose Sosa. During a restaurant dinner, a drunken Tony blames Manny for his arrest and calls Elvira an infertile junkie, prompting Elvira to call out his criminality to the other patrons and leave him. Sosa's henchman Alberto the Shadow puts a radio-controlled bomb under the journalist's car, but Tony tries to call off the hit when he sees the journalist accompanied by his wife and children. When Alberto refuses to back down, Tony kills him before he can detonate the bomb. Sosa vows revenge on Tony for allowing the journalist to deliver the exposé. At his mother's behest, Tony, high on cocaine, tracks down Gina and finds her with Manny. Tony fatally shoots Manny before learning that Gina has just married him. Tony takes Gina to his estate and begins a cocaine binge in his office. As Sosa's men invade the estate and begin killing the guards, Gina mockingly urges Tony to have sex with her in a moment of emotional breakdown, highlighting his obsessive control over her relationships. She shoots and wounds him, and is killed by one of Sosa's men, whom Tony kills in turn. Seeking vengeance, he opens fire on the group using an M16 rifle equipped with an M203 grenade launcher, killing many of them but sustaining multiple gunshot wounds and eventually getting disarmed. As he taunts his attackers, Sosa's enforcer, known as \"The Skull\", appears and shoots him in the back with a double-barreled shotgun, killing him.

    "title": "Shutter Island",
    "plot": "In 1954, U.S. Marshal Edward \"Teddy\" Daniels and his new partner Chuck Aule travel to Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane on the inhospitable Shutter Island, Boston Harbor, to investigate the disappearance of Rachel Solando, a patient of the hospital who had previously drowned her three children. The staff, led by psychiatrist Dr. John Cawley and his colleague Dr. Jerimiah Naehring, appear uncooperative. The marshals learn that Dr. Lester Sheehan, who was treating Solando, had left the island on vacation immediately after Solando disappeared. Teddy experiences migraine headaches, flashbacks of his experiences as a U.S. Army soldier during the liberation of Dachau, and also vivid dreams of his wife Dolores, who was killed in a fire set by arsonist Andrew Laeddis. Teddy explains to Chuck that he took the case to find Laeddis, believing he is on the island. Solando suddenly resurfaces and believes Teddy is her husband. Teddy later breaks into the restricted Ward C to find Laeddis, where he meets patient George Noyce who appears to know Teddy. He tells Teddy that the doctors experiment on patients and some are taken to a lighthouse to be lobotomized. He warns Teddy that everyone is deceiving him and tells him not to trust Chuck. Teddy regroups with Chuck and they climb the cliffs toward the lighthouse but become separated. Believing he saw Chuck's body on the rocks below, Teddy climbs down but finds only a cave where a woman claiming to be the real Solando is hiding. She states that she is a former psychiatrist who discovered clandestine experiments to develop mind control but was forcibly committed. She says that Cawley and Dr. Naehring will use Teddy's war trauma to feign a psychotic break, allowing them to have him also committed. Teddy returns to the hospital and is greeted by Cawley. When Teddy asks about Chuck's whereabouts, Cawley insists that Teddy does not have a partner and that he arrived on the island alone. Convinced Chuck was taken to the lighthouse, Teddy heads there but runs into Naehring, who attempts to sedate him. Teddy overpowers him and breaks into the lighthouse, only to discover Cawley waiting for him. Teddy confronts Cawley and reveals his encounter with Solando, saying he believes Cawley is experimenting on him. Cawley denies that Solando ever existed, and insists that Teddy has not been drugged, explaining the tremors as withdrawals from chlorpromazine, a neuroleptic medication that Teddy has been taking for two years. Chuck arrives and reveals he is, in fact, Dr. Sheehan. Cawley explains that \"Teddy\" is Andrew Laeddis, a U.S. Marshal incarcerated at Ashecliffe for murdering his manic depressive wife after she drowned their three children. Andrew did not seek treatment for Dolores when she burned down their apartment and instead moved his family to a lake house, where Dolores carried out the killings. Cawley explains that Andrew's delusion is a result of his guilt, that his migraines and hallucinations are withdrawal symptoms, and that he had created the alternate persona of Edward Daniels, also a Marshal, who acted violently and espoused conspiracy theories about the facility. The \"investigation\" is an elaborate role-play to regain his true persona. Overwhelmed by his sudden recall, Andrew faints. Awakening later, Andrew calmly recounts the truth, satisfying the doctors that he is lucid. Cawley notes that they had achieved this state nine months before, but that Andrew had quickly regressed. He warns that this will be Andrew's last chance and if he lapses again he will be lobotomized due to his very violent conduct towards other patients such as Noyce, and towards the guards. Sometime later, Andrew relaxes on the hospital grounds with Sheehan. Appearing delusional, Andrew again refers to Sheehan as \"Chuck\" and says they must leave the island. Sheehan signals to Cawley, who orders that Andrew be lobotomized. Andrew then asks Sheehan if it would be worse \"to live as a monster, or to die as a good man\". A stunned Sheehan calls Andrew \"Teddy\" but the latter does not respond and leaves peacefully with the orderlies for his operation.",

    "title": "The Green Mile",
    "plot": "In 1935, corrections officer Paul Edgecomb oversees \"The Green Mile,\" the death row section of Cold Mountain Penitentiary, alongside officers Brutus Howell, Dean Stanton, Harry Terwilliger, and the sadistic and despised Percy Wetmore, whose connections to the state governor shield him from punishment. The guards supervise three prisoners: Eduard Delacroix, who is frequently tormented by Percy; the violent and erratic William Wharton; and John Coffey, a hulking yet gentle and simple-minded African-American man convicted of raping and murdering two white girls after being found distraught while cradling their bodies. John asserts that he tried to \"take it back\", but could not. Paul grows doubtful that John committed the crimes and soon discovers he possesses miraculous healing abilities. John cures Paul's crippling bladder infection by absorbing it into himself before expelling it as flies, explaining that he \"took it back\". After Percy crushes Eduard's pet mouse, Mr. Jingles, John urgently requests the body and resurrects it, further convincing the guards of his powers. Fed up with Percy's behavior, the officers let him officiate an execution on the condition that he take a job at Briar Ridge insane asylum afterward. At Eduard's execution, Percy deliberately neglects to wet the sponge meant to conduct electricity, causing Eduard an agonizing death. John senses and is overwhelmed by Eduard's pain, causing him to inadvertently transfer some of his power into Mr. Jingles, who scurries away. Paul convinces the guards (excluding Percy) to take John to heal warden Hal's terminally ill wife, Melinda. They straitjacket Percy and confine him to a padded cell as punishment for torturing Eduard before sneaking John out of the prison to the warden's home. John absorbs Melinda's illness, restoring her health, but is left in severe pain from containing it within him. The guards return John to his cell, and release Percy, but John grabs hold of and transfers the illness into Percy, who, in a possessed state, shoots Wharton dead. Paul demands answers, leading John to transfer into him Wharton's memories, revealing him to be responsible for the crimes of which John was convicted. Percy is left catatonic and later committed to Briar Ridge. Though convinced of John's innocence, Paul cannot prove it or stop the execution. He offers John a chance to escape, believing it unacceptable to destroy what he considers to be a true miracle. John, however, exhausted by the pain he endures from constantly sensing the suffering and ugliness that people inflict on each other, chooses to die. His last request is to watch a movie, never having seen one before, so he, Paul, and the other officers watch Top Hat (1935). When John is taken to be executed, he tells the guards of his last dream, in which he and the two girls are safe and happy. John is saddened by the hatred he feels from those in attendance, who still believe him to be guilty, but Brutus encourages him to focus on the guards, who do not hate him. John requests not to wear a hood, because he is afraid of the dark. Paul briefly takes John's hand before the tearful officers reluctantly carry out the execution. In 1999, Paul, now 108 years old, watches Top Hat and, reminded of the events, recounts John's story to his friend Elaine, revealing it was the last execution he and Brutus performed before transferring to juvenile corrections. Elaine is stunned when Paul reveals that Mr. Jingles is still alive. While she calls Paul's longevity a miracle, he sees having outlived all his loved ones as a divine punishment for allowing John to die. After Elaine's funeral, Paul wonders how much longer he will live if a mouse's life could be so significantly extended, lamenting, \"Sometimes, the Green Mile seems so long.\"",

    "plot": "In Gotham City, after falling down a well and getting swarmed by bats, a young Bruce Wayne develops a fear of them. At the opera with his parents, Bruce becomes unsettled by performers masquerading as bats and asks to leave. Outside, mugger Joe Chill murders Bruce's parents in front of him. Bruce is raised by the family butler, Alfred Pennyworth. Fourteen years later, Chill testifies against mafia crime boss Carmine Falcone, and is paroled. Bruce intends to murder Chill to avenge his parents, but an assassin in Falcone's employ does so first. Bruce's childhood friend, Rachel Dawes, berates him for acting outside the justice system. After confronting Falcone, who says real power comes from being feared, Bruce spends the next seven years traveling the world, training in combat, and immersing himself in the criminal underworld. In a Bhutan prison, he is approached by Henri Ducard, who recruits him to the League of Shadows, led by Ra's al Ghul. After completing his training, Bruce rejects the League and its mandate that all criminals should be killed. He escapes after learning the League believes Gotham is beyond saving and intends to destroy it, burning down their temple in the process. Ra's is killed by falling debris, while Bruce saves the unconscious Ducard. Intent on fighting crime, Bruce returns to Gotham and takes an interest in his family's company, Wayne Enterprises, which is being taken public by businessman William Earle. Company archivist Lucius Fox, a friend of Bruce's father, allows him access to prototype defense technologies, including a protective bodysuit and the Tumbler, an armored vehicle. Bruce poses publicly as a shallow playboy while setting up a base in the caves beneath Wayne Manor and taking up the vigilante identity of \"Batman,\" inspired by his childhood fear, which he has now conquered. Intercepting a drug shipment, Batman provides Rachel, now an Assistant District Attorney, with evidence against Falcone and enlists Sergeant James Gordon, one of Gotham's few honest police officers, to arrest him. In prison, Falcone meets Dr. Jonathan Crane, a corrupt psychologist who smuggled drugs into Gotham with his help. Donning a scarecrow mask, Crane sprays Falcone with a fear-inducing hallucinogen, driving him insane and transferring him to Arkham Asylum. While investigating Crane, Batman is ambushed by him and sprayed with the hallucinogen. Batman barely escapes and is saved by Alfred and Fox, who develop an antidote for the hallucinogen. When Rachel accuses Crane of corruption, he reveals he has introduced his drug into Gotham's water supply and drugs her with the hallucinogen. Batman later subdues Crane and sprays him with his own chemical. While being interrogated, Crane claims to work for Ra's al Ghul. Batman evades the police to get Rachel to safety and administers the antidote. He gives her two vials: one for Gordon and the other for mass production. At Bruce's birthday party, Ducard reappears and reveals himself to be the true Ra's al Ghul. Having stolen a powerful microwave emitter from Wayne Enterprises, he plans to vaporize Gotham's water supply, rendering Crane's drug airborne and causing mass hysteria that will destroy the city. He sets Wayne Manor aflame and leaves Bruce to die, but Alfred rescues him. Ra's loads the emitter onto Gotham's monorail train to release the drug at the city's central water source under Wayne Tower. Batman rescues Rachel from a drugged mob and reveals his identity to her. He confronts Ra's on the train as Gordon uses the Tumbler's cannons to destroy a section of the track. Batman escapes the train and leaves Ra's to die as it crashes. Bruce gains Rachel's respect. However, she refuses to be with him, promising they can be together when Gotham no longer needs Batman. Batman becomes a public hero. After purchasing a controlling stake in Wayne Enterprises, Bruce fires Earle and replaces him with Fox. Gordon is promoted to Lieutenant, shows Batman the Bat-Signal, and tells him about a criminal who leaves behind Joker playing cards. Batman promises to look into it and disappears into the night.",

    "title": "Dead Poets Society",
    "plot": "In 1959, Todd Anderson begins his junior year of high school at Welton Academy, an Episcopalian all-male preparatory boarding school in Vermont. Todd is assigned one of Welton's top students, junior Neil Perry, as his roommate, and through Neil, he meets his friends: Knox Overstreet, Richard Cameron, Steven Meeks, Gerard Pitts, and Charlie Dalton. On the first day of classes, the boys are taken aback by the unusual teaching methods of their new English teacher, John Keating. A Welton alumnus who studied English Literature at Cambridge, Keating encourages his students to \"seize the day\", referencing the Latin expression carpe diem. Keating has the students take turns standing on his desk to demonstrate ways to look at life differently, tells them to rip out the introduction of their poetry books that explains a mathematical formula for rating poetry, and invites them to make up their own style of walking in a courtyard to encourage their individualism. Keating's methods attract the attention of strict headmaster Gale Nolan. Upon learning that Keating had been a member of the unofficial Dead Poets Society during his time as a student at Welton, Neil restarts the club, and he and his friends sneak off campus to a cave, where they read poetry. Keating's lessons and their involvement with the club encourage them to live their lives on their own terms. Knox pursues Chris Noel, a cheerleader who is dating Chet Danburry, a football player from a local public school, and whose family is friends with his. Neil discovers his love of acting, and gets the role of Puck in a local production of A Midsummer Night's Dream, despite the disapproval of his controlling father, who wants him to attend Harvard for medical school. Keating helps Todd come out of his shell and realize his potential when he takes him through an exercise in self-expression, resulting in his spontaneously composing a poem in front of the class. Charlie publishes an article in the school newspaper, on behalf of the club, recommending that girls be admitted to Welton. In response, Nolan paddles Charlie, attempting to force him to reveal who else is in the Dead Poets Society; but Charlie remains defiant. Nolan also confronts Keating, advising him that he should discourage his students from questioning authority. Keating gently admonishes Charlie, advising the boys that one must assess all potential consequences of one's actions. On the eve of the play's opening performance, Neil's father discovers his involvement in the play and demands that he quit immediately. Keating advises Neil to explain to his father that he is passionate about acting and takes it seriously. After Neil performs in the play, his father retaliates by telling him he will withdraw him from Welton the following morning and enroll him in Braden Military School. Lacking any support from his mother and unable to explain to his father how he feels, Neil commits suicide using his father's gun. At Neil's parents' request, Nolan investigates his death. During the investigation, Cameron shifts blame onto Keating to avoid punishment for his role in the Dead Poets Society, and he names the other members of the group. When Charlie confronts him over this, Cameron urges the other students to let Keating take the fall. Charlie punches Cameron and is expelled. Each of the boys is called to Nolan's office to sign a letter confirming Cameron's false allegations. When Todd's turn comes, he reluctantly signs the letter under his parents' pressure, and Keating is fired as a result. Nolan, who had taught English at Welton prior to becoming headmaster, temporarily takes over Keating's English class. As Keating interrupts the class to gather his belongings, Todd confesses that the boys were pressured into signing the letter that led to his dismissal. Keating assures Todd that he believes him. Nolan threatens to expel Todd and anyone else who speaks out of line. Despite the threat, Todd stands up on his desk and says \"O Captain! My Captain!\". The other members of the Dead Poets Society, except for Cameron, along with several other students in the class, follow suit. Touched by their support, Keating proudly thanks the boys and departs.",

    "plot": "One snowy evening, an elderly woman tells her granddaughter the story of a young man named Edward, who has scissor blades for hands. Many years earlier, Peg Boggs, a door-to-door Avon saleswoman, drives to the decrepit Gothic mansion where Edward lives. The creation of an old inventor, Edward is an ageless humanoid. The inventor homeschooled Edward but died from a heart attack before giving Edward hands, leaving him unfinished. Peg finds Edward alone and offers to take him to her home. She introduces Edward to her husband, Bill, their young son, Kevin, and their teenage daughter, Kim. Edward falls in love with Kim. As their neighbors are curious about the new houseguest, the Boggses throw a neighborhood barbecue welcoming him. Most of the neighbors are fascinated by Edward and befriend him, except for the eccentric religious fanatic Esmeralda and Kim's supercilious boyfriend, Jim. Edward repays the neighborhood for their kindness by trimming their hedges into topiaries, progressing to grooming dogs and later styling the hair of the neighborhood women. One of the neighbors, Joyce, offers to help Edward open a hair salon. While scouting a location, Joyce attempts to seduce him but scares him away. Joyce lies to the neighborhood women that Edward forced himself on her, reducing their trust in him. Edward's dream of opening the salon is ruined when the bank refuses him a loan. Jealous of Kim's attraction to Edward, Jim takes advantage of his naivety by asking him to pick the lock on his parents' home so he can steal his father's electronic goods and sell them to buy a van. Edward agrees, but when he picks the lock and enters the house, a burglar alarm is triggered and walls come down, trapping him inside. Jim flees, and Edward is arrested. The police determine that a lifetime of isolation has left Edward without any common sense or morality; thus, he cannot be criminally charged. Edward nevertheless takes responsibility for the robbery, telling Kim that he did it because she asked him to. Consequently, he is shunned by the entire neighborhood except for the Boggs family. At Christmas, Edward carves an ice sculpture modeled after Kim; the ice shavings are thrown into the air and fall like snow, something that has never happened before in the town. Kim dances in the snowfall. Jim arrives suddenly, calling out to Edward, surprising him and causing him to accidentally cut Kim's hand. Jim accuses Edward of intentionally harming her, but Kim, fed up with Jim's jealous behavior towards Edward, breaks up with him. Meanwhile, Edward flees. Kim's parents go to find Edward while she stays behind in case he returns. Edward returns, finding Kim there. She asks him to hold her and arranges his scissor hands so they can embrace. Jim's drunken friend drives to Kim's house and nearly runs over Kim's younger brother, Kevin, but Edward pushes Kevin to safety while inadvertently cutting him. Witnesses accuse Edward of attacking Kevin. When Jim assaults him, Edward defends himself and injures Jim's arm before fleeing back to the inventor's mansion. Kim goes to find Edward. Jim obtains a gun, follows her, and shoots at Edward before grabbing a fire poker and beating him. Edward refuses to fight back until he sees Jim strike Kim as she attempts to intervene. Enraged, Edward stabs Jim in the stomach and pushes him from a window of the mansion to his death. Kim confesses her love to Edward and kisses him as they accept that their love can never be fulfilled. As the neighbors gather, Kim convinces them that Jim and Edward killed each other. The elderly woman, revealing herself to be Kim, finishes telling her granddaughter the story and says that she never saw Edward again, hoping that by staying away he would remember her as she was in her youth. She believes he is still alive because it would not be snowing without him. Edward is then seen carving ice sculptures of his experiences with Kim, with the bits of ice floating as snow in the wind. The elderly Kim, commenting on the snow, concludes, \"Sometimes you can still catch me dancing in it.\"",

    "plot": "In German-occupied Kraków during World War II, the Nazis force local Polish Jews into the overcrowded Kraków Ghetto. Oskar Schindler, a German Nazi Party member from Czechoslovakia, arrives in the city, hoping to make his fortune. He bribes Wehrmacht (German armed forces) and SS officials, acquiring a factory to produce enamelware. Schindler hires Itzhak Stern, a Jewish official with contacts among black marketeers and the Jewish business community; he handles administration and helps Schindler arrange financing. Stern ensures that as many Jewish workers as possible were deemed essential to the German war effort to prevent them from being taken by the SS to concentration camps or killed. Meanwhile, Schindler maintains friendly relations with the Nazis and enjoys his new wealth and status as an industrialist. SS-Untersturmführer (second lieutenant) Amon Göth arrives in Kraków to oversee construction of the Płaszów concentration camp. When the camp is ready, he orders the ghetto liquidated: two thousand Jews are transported to Płaszów, and two thousand others are killed in the streets by the SS. Schindler witnesses the massacre and is profoundly affected. He particularly notices a young girl in a red coat who hides from the Nazis and later sees her body on a wagonload of corpses. Schindler is careful to maintain his friendship with Göth and continues to enjoy SS support, mostly through bribery. Göth brutalizes his Jewish maid, Helen Hirsch, and randomly shoots people from the balcony of his villa; the prisoners are in constant fear for their lives. As time passes, Schindler's focus shifts from making money to trying to save as many lives as possible. To better protect his workers, Schindler bribes Göth into allowing him to build a sub-camp at his factory. As the Germans begin losing the war, Göth is ordered to ship the remaining Jews at Płaszów to Auschwitz concentration camp. Schindler asks Göth for permission to move his workers to a munitions factory he plans to build in Brünnlitz near his hometown of Zwittau. Göth reluctantly agrees but charges a huge bribe. Schindler and Stern prepare a list of people to be transferred to Brünnlitz instead of Auschwitz. The list eventually includes 1,100 names. As the Jewish workers are transported by train to Brünnlitz, the women and girls are mistakenly redirected to Auschwitz-Birkenau; Schindler bribes Rudolf Höss, the commandant of Auschwitz, for their release. At the new factory, Schindler forbids the SS guards from entering the production area without permission and encourages the Jews to observe the Sabbath. Over the next seven months, he spends his fortune bribing Nazi officials and buying shell casings from other companies. Due to Schindler's machinations, the factory produces no usable armaments. He runs out of money in 1945, just as Germany surrenders. As a Nazi Party member and war profiteer, Schindler must flee the advancing Red Army to avoid capture. The SS guards at the factory have been ordered to kill the Jewish workforce, but Schindler persuades them not to do so. Bidding farewell to his workers, he prepares to head west, hoping to surrender to the Americans. The workers give him a signed statement attesting to his role in saving Jewish lives and present him with a ring engraved with a Talmudic paraphrase: \"Whoever saves one life saves the world entire\". Schindler breaks down in tears, feeling he should have done more, and is comforted by the workers before he and his wife leave in their car. When the Schindlerjuden awaken the next morning, a mounted Soviet officer announces they have been liberated but warns them not to go east because \"they hate you there\". The Jews then walk into the countryside. An epilogue reveals that Göth was executed via hanging for crimes against humanity; Schindler and his wife were declared Righteous Among the Nations and a tree was planted in his honor in the Garden of the Righteous Among the Nations. Many of the surviving Schindlerjuden and the actors portraying them visit Schindler's grave and place stones on its marker (a traditional Jewish sign of respect for the dead), after which Liam Neeson lays two roses.",

    "title": "Whiplash",
    "plot": "Jazz drummer Andrew Neiman (Teller) attends the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory in New York City, hoping to leave a legacy like that of his idol Buddy Rich. Terence Fletcher (Simmons), the conductor of the Shaffer Conservatory Studio Band, recruits him to play in the Studio ensemble as an alternate for core drummer Carl Tanner (Lang). Andrew discovers that Fletcher, although encouraging at first, is relentlessly strict and verbally and physically abusive towards his students. When he apparently fails to keep tempo on Hank Levy's \"Whiplash\" during his first ensemble rehearsal, Fletcher throws a chair at him, repeatedly slaps his face, and berates him. Determined to impress Fletcher, Andrew excessively practices, often until his hands blister and bleed. In the meantime, Andrew goes on a date and becomes romantically involved with a woman named Nicole (Benoist). After their first set at a jazz competition, Andrew misplaces Tanner's sheet music. Tanner cannot play without the sheets, so Fletcher assigns Andrew to perform \"Whiplash\" from memory, resulting in Shaffer winning the competition. Fletcher promotes Andrew to core drummer. However, Andrew is taken aback when Fletcher abruptly reassigns the position to Ryan Connolly (Stowell), a drummer from a lower-level ensemble within Shaffer. Because of his single-mindedness toward music, Andrew clashes with his family and breaks up with Nicole to focus on his ambitions. Fletcher begins rehearsal by announcing that Sean Casey, a former member of the Studio Band, died in a car crash. He then pushes the three drummers to play at a faster tempo on \"Caravan\", keeping them for a grueling five-hour practice. Andrew is the only one able to perform on-tempo, and earns the core position back. On the way to the next competition, Andrew's bus gets a flat tire. He rents a car but arrives late and forgets his drumsticks at the rental office, irritating Fletcher. Andrew races back and retrieves them, but his car is hit by a truck on the way back. Heavily injured, Andrew crawls from the wreckage and runs to the theater, arriving bloodied and weak just as the ensemble enters the stage. He struggles to keep tempo and Fletcher halts the performance to dismiss him from the band. Enraged, Andrew attacks Fletcher onstage and is subsequently expelled from Shaffer. At the request of his father, Jim (Reiser), Andrew meets Rachel Bornholdt (Grace), a lawyer representing the parents of the late Sean Casey, who had actually hanged himself after suffering from depression and anxiety resulting from Fletcher's abuse. Casey's parents want Fletcher held accountable, so Andrew reluctantly agrees to testify anonymously, leading Shaffer to terminate Fletcher. Andrew abandons drumming but encounters Fletcher months later playing piano at a jazz club. Over a drink, Fletcher admits his teaching methods were harsh but insists they were necessary to motivate his students. Citing a story where Jo Jones allegedly threw a cymbal at Charlie Parker as an example, Fletcher says that the next jazz musician to live up to Parker's legacy would never let discouragement stop them. Fletcher invites Andrew to perform with his professional band at a New York JVC Jazz Festival, playing the same pieces from the Shaffer Studio Band; Andrew accepts. Andrew calls Nicole to invite her to the performance but learns she has a new boyfriend. At the festival, Fletcher tells Andrew he knows Andrew testified against him. As revenge, Fletcher leads the band into a new song Andrew does not know. After a disastrous performance, Andrew walks offstage humiliated. Jim embraces Andrew backstage, but Andrew decides to return to the stage, reclaiming the drum kit and cutting off Fletcher's introduction to the next tune by cueing the band into \"Caravan\". Initially angered, Fletcher resumes conducting. As the piece finishes, Andrew continues into an unexpected improvised solo. He plays continuously at an extraordinary speed to the point his hands start bleeding and he seemingly goes into a trance, while Jim watches in horror. Impressed, Fletcher nods in approval before cueing the final chord.",

    "plot": "In 1969, FBI agent Carl Hanratty arrives in Marseille, France, to pick up a prisoner named Frank Abagnale Jr., who has fallen ill due to the prison's poor conditions. Six years prior, Frank lived in New Rochelle, New York, with his father, Frank Sr., and his French mother, Paula. During his youth, he witnesses his father's many techniques for conning people, but Frank Sr.'s tax problems with the IRS eventually force the family to move from their house and into a small apartment. One day, Frank discovers his mother is having an affair with Jack Barnes, his father's friend from the New Rochelle Rotary Club. When his parents divorce, Frank runs away. Needing money, he turns to confidence scams to survive, his cons progressively growing bolder. He poses as a Pan Am pilot named Frank Taylor and forges payroll checks from Pan Am. Soon, his forgeries are worth millions of dollars. News of the crimes reaches the FBI and Carl begins tracking Frank. He finds him at a motel, but Frank tricks Carl into believing he is a Secret Service agent named Barry Allen. He escapes before Carl realizes he was fooled. Frank then begins to impersonate a doctor. As Dr. Frank Conners, he falls in love with Brenda, a naive young hospital nurse, and asks her attorney father for both her hand in marriage and help with arrangements to take the Louisiana State Bar exam, which Frank passes. Carl tracks Frank to his and Brenda's engagement party, but Frank escapes through a bedroom window, telling Brenda to meet him at Miami International Airport two days later. At the airport, Frank spots Brenda, but also plainclothes agents. He realizes she has given him up, then drives away. Reassuming his pilot identity, he stages a recruiting drive for stewardesses at a local college. Surrounded by eight women as stewardesses, he conceals himself from Carl and the other agents at the airport and escapes on a flight to Madrid. In 1967, Carl tracks down Frank in his mother's hometown of Montrichard, France, and convinces him to surrender to the French police. Frank is immediately arrested and taken into French custody, but Carl assures him that he will get him extradited back to the U.S. Picking back up once more in 1969, Carl takes Frank on a flight back to the U.S. As they approach, Carl informs Frank that Frank Sr. has died. Grief-stricken, Frank escapes from the plane and reaches the house of his mother, who now has a daughter with Barnes. Frank surrenders to Carl and is sentenced to 12 years in a maximum-security prison. Carl occasionally visits Frank. During one visit, he shows him a fraudulent check from a case on which he is working. Frank immediately deduces that the bank teller was involved in the fraud. Impressed, Carl convinces the FBI to allow him to serve the remainder of his sentence working for the FBI Financial Crimes Unit. Frank agrees, but soon grows restless doing the tedious office work. One weekend, Frank prepares to impersonate a pilot again and is intercepted by Carl, who is willing to let him continue with his con, assuring him that no one is chasing him and that it is his choice. Frank returns to work and discusses another fraud case with Carl, who asks him how he cheated on the Louisiana State Bar exam. Frank tells him he studied and passed it. Carl smiles and asks Frank if he is telling the truth, but Frank does not answer, instead giving Carl input on a new fraud case. A postscript says that Frank lived for 26 years in the Midwestern United States with his wife, with whom he had three sons, remained friends with Carl, and made a living as a leading expert on bank fraud and forgery in the FBI.",

From his commander father-in-law to beautiful wife, Jin-pyong is the subject of much envy and jealousy. But his affection for his wife has subsided long ago, and due to post-traumatic disorder from the Vietnam War, he suffers mental breakdowns and nightmares of the fallen soldiers under his command. One day, Captain Kyung Woo-jin is transferred to Jin-pyong's troop and he moves in next door with his wife Ga-heun. Jin-pyong encounters Ga-heun and instantly falls in love with her.

She begins to develop cordial feelings for Jin-pyong for risking his own life to save her from the vicious attack. Jin-pyong and Ga-heun meet in complete secrecy and share their own memories. Over time, their love for one another blossoms to maturity. As the two enjoy their secret love affair, Ga-heun receives a call that her mother is ill and immediately goes to the hospital and there they are met by Ga-heun's mother-in-law. Her mother-in-law raised Ga-heun when she lost her family as if she was one of her own children, and Ga-heun's guilt leads her to end her affair with Jin-pyong. He has no choice but to go along with her decision. Jin-pyong has a hard time getting over her, and he schemes to falsely accuse Woo-jin for something he did not do, but the scheme does not work. It is a living hell to see Ga-heun giving him the cold shoulder, adding to the fact that she is so close by, being in the same base, and living next door to her. Jin-pyong is finally promoted to general, and a celebration party is held. Ga-heun and Woo-jin also attend the party. Jin-pyong is surrounded by people congratulating him, but he can only scan the room for a glimpse of Ga-heun. It is also revealed that Jin-pyong's wife is pregnant. He gets drunk by the end of the night, and not being able to contain his feelings any longer, he shouts why she had to leave him, completely exposing their secret affair to the entire army. In a fit of rage for insulting his daughter, his father-in-law decides to send Jin-pyong back to Vietnam. Jin-pyong pleads Ga-heun that he's willing to give up his army career for her. But she says she's not so in love with him that she's willing to give up her life. He is devastated by her response and attempts to commit suicide. He even fails that and leaves the base for Vietnam. Two years later, while attending an official party, a group of Special Unit men from Vietnam approach Ga-heun. They tell her that Jin-pyong died on the battlefield while guiding them, and give her something. In his dying moment, he reached out for a polaroid photograph of Ga-heun and himself. Even though the affair was short, the polaroid captured a happy moment of the two ballroom dancing. On the back, a short phrase is written on it – \"My Love\". Ga heun cries in grief while Jin-pyoung is seen taken dead in a helicopter.",

    "plot": "Arthur Fleck is a party clown and aspiring stand-up comedian who lives with his mother, Penny, in a crime- and recession-ridden Gotham City. He suffers from a neurological disorder that causes him to have random, uncontrollable laughing fits, requiring medication he depends on social services to obtain. After Arthur is attacked by street youths while on the job, his co-worker Randall gives him a revolver to defend himself. Arthur pursues a relationship with his neighbor, single mother Sophie Dumond, and invites her to see his routine at a comedy club. Arthur accidentally drops his gun while performing at a children's hospital. Randall does not admit he gave the gun to Arthur, leading to Arthur's firing. While riding home on the subway and still wearing his clown make-up, he is mocked and assaulted by three drunk businessmen from Wayne Investments. He fatally shoots two of them in self-defense and murders the third as he attempts to flee. Their employer, billionaire mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne, condemns the killings, but supporters begin sporting clown masks in Arthur's image. Budget cuts shut down the social services program, leaving Arthur without his medication. Sophie attends Arthur's stand-up routine, which fails due to his disorder and his jokes falling flat. Arthur intercepts a letter from Penny to Thomas indicating that he is Thomas's illegitimate son, and berates his mother for hiding the truth of his parentage. He goes to Wayne Manor, where he meets Thomas's young son Bruce, but flees after a scuffle with family butler Alfred Pennyworth. Penny suffers a stroke after being questioned by two detectives investigating Arthur's involvement in the subway murders, and is hospitalized. Arthur's idol, popular late-night talk show host Murray Franklin, presents clips of Arthur's failed performance on his show and mockingly calls him a \"joker\", much to Arthur's distress. Arthur confronts Thomas at a movie theatre. Thomas denies being his father, claiming that Penny also is not his biological mother. Arthur visits Arkham State Hospital and reads Penny's file, which states she was a delusional narcissist who adopted Arthur while working as a housekeeper for the Waynes. She developed an imaginary intimate relationship with Thomas, which included Arthur being their biological son. At the same time, Penny raised Arthur with a boyfriend who physically and sexually abused them, leading to his neurological disorder. A distraught Arthur enters Sophie's apartment unannounced. Frightened, she kindly asks him to leave, revealing their relationship to be a figment of Arthur's imagination. The following day, Arthur smothers Penny with a pillow at the hospital. Due to the fame caused by the clips of his performance, Arthur is invited onto Murray's show. Arthur decides to bring the gun, intending to kill himself on live TV. While getting ready, Arthur is visited by Randall and another ex-colleague, Gary. Arthur fatally stabs and beats and kills Randall, but spares Gary for being kind to him in the past. The detectives investigating Arthur pursue him onto a train filled with clown protesters. Arthur incites a brawl, during which one detective accidentally shoots and kills a protester. The other protesters, in turn, beat the detectives while Arthur escapes. At the studio, Arthur asks Murray to introduce him as \"Joker\", a reference to his earlier mockery. As the show broadcasts live, Arthur tells morbid jokes, confesses to the subway murders, rants about societal neglect of the downtrodden, and berates Murray for ridiculing him. After a final joke, Arthur fatally shoots Murray in the eye. Arthur is arrested, and riots erupt across the city. Looters in an ambulance crash into the police car carrying Arthur and free him. Meanwhile, one rioter corners the Wayne family in an alley and murders Thomas and his wife Martha in front of Bruce. Arthur stands on the police car, dances to the cheers of the crowd, and smears the blood on his face into a smile. Sometime later at Arkham, Arthur laughs to himself about a joke during a session with his new therapist. He declines telling it to her, claiming she would not understand it. He leaves behind a trail of bloodied shoeprints as an orderly chases him down.",

    "plot": "In 1929 Lynchburg, Virginia, young Desmond Doss nearly kills his brother while roughhousing. That event and his Seventh-day Adventist upbringing reinforce Desmond's belief in the commandment \"Thou shalt not kill\". Years later, he takes an injured man to the hospital and a romance develops with nurse, Dorothy Schutte. Desmond tells her of his interest in medical work. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brings the United States into World War II, Desmond enlists in the United States Army to serve as a combat medic. His father, Tom, a PTSD-ridden World War I veteran, is deeply upset by the decision. Shortly before leaving, Desmond and Dorothy get engaged. Desmond is placed in basic training with the 77th Infantry Division under the command of Sergeant Howell. He excels physically but becomes a pariah among some of his fellow soldiers for refusing to handle a rifle and train on Saturdays. Howell and Captain Glover attempts to discharge Desmond for psychiatric reasons under Section 8 are overruled, as Desmond's religious beliefs do not constitute mental illness. They subsequently torment Desmond with grueling labor tasks intended to drive him out. Despite being beaten one night by his fellow soldiers, Doss refuses to identify his attackers, earning their respect. Desmond's unit completes basic training and is released on leave during which Desmond intends to marry Dorothy, but his refusal to carry a firearm leads to an arrest for insubordination. Captain Glover and Dorothy visit Desmond in jail and try to convince him to plead guilty so that he can be released without charge, but he refuses to compromise his beliefs. He pleads not guilty at his court-martial but is found guilty. His father bursts into the tribunal before sentence can be pronounced with a letter from his former commanding officer, now a brigadier general, stating his son's pacifism is protected by the US Constitution. The charges are dropped, and Desmond and Dorothy are married. Desmond’s unit is deployed to the Pacific Theater. During the Battle of Okinawa, they are tasked with ascending and securing the Maeda Escarpment (\"Hacksaw Ridge\"). The battle begins with heavy losses on both sides. Desmond saves the life of his squad-mate Smitty, who apologizes for doubting his courage. Desmond reveals that his aversion to holding a firearm stems from nearly shooting his drunken father, who threatened his mother with a gun. When a Japanese counterattack drives the Americans off the escarpment, Smitty is killed, and Howell and several of Desmond’s comrades are left injured on the battlefield. Desmond hears the cries of dying soldiers and returns to save them, carrying the wounded to the cliff's edge and belaying them down by rope, each time praying to save one more. The rescue of dozens of wounded who had been presumed dead comes as a shock to the rest of the unit below. When day breaks, Desmond rescues Howell under heavy fire. Captain Glover apologizes for dismissing Desmond’s beliefs and states that they are scheduled to retake the ridge on Saturday but will not launch the next attack without him. Desmond agrees, but the operation is delayed until after he concludes his Sabbath prayers. With reinforcements, they turn the tide of battle. In an ambush set by Japanese soldiers who pretend to surrender, Desmond saves Glover and others by deflecting enemy grenades. He is wounded by a grenade blast, but the battle is won. Desmond is lowered from the cliff, clutching the Bible that Dorothy had given to him. The film closes with images of the real Desmond Doss being awarded the Medal of Honor by President Harry S. Truman for rescuing 75 soldiers at Hacksaw Ridge, and an interview with Desmond just before his death, recounting his experiences during the war.",

When the device is opened on the deck of the ship, it is revealed to contain Quỳnh, an immortal who has been imprisoned inside for 500 years. Six months after Booker was sentenced to loneliness, Andy leads Joe, Nicky, Nile, and Copley to retrieve a weapons cache from a secure compound in Split. While in hiding, Nile has a dream of a woman incapacitating a person inside a library before stealing their books. In Paris, Booker is found and abducted by Quỳnh. Andy and Copley track down a sage-immortal, Tuah, in Seoul, who has deep knowledge of immortals and is an old friend of Andy's, who revealed that he had rescued her when Quỳnh was being sealed in an iron maiden 500 years ago. He confirms that his books containing information about the immortals were stolen by an immortal named Discord, who over the centuries after parting ways with Tuah, had become a highly elusive arms dealer. Andy and Copley escort Tuah to a hideout in Rimini, where Andy receives a note from Quỳnh—via Booker after he was released from captivity—demanding to see Andy in Rome, where Quỳnh had been cast into the sea. The two have a tense reunion during which Quỳnh blames Andy for what she perceives as Andy abandoning her promise to rescue her, before Quỳnh briefly fights against Andy and retrieves her necklace. Nile confronts Discord, who explains that she (Discord) was the first – and that Nile is the last – immortal in their world, noting their identical and connecting skin birthmarks. Tuah theorizes that the \"last immortal\" has the power to take away someone's immortality whenever they injure someone. Additionally, anyone who has lost their immortality can regain their power by another wounded immortal who can transfer their power to the host they choose. The first part of the theory is confirmed when Nile grazes Booker's forearm in a spar and his wounds no longer heal; Booker insists that Tuah not reveal this to Andy. Andy and Copley learn that Discord and Quỳnh's mercenaries have taken control of a Chinese-built and owned nuclear facility in South Tangerang and planted shaped charges inside the core, which would irradiate the area and affect millions of people should the charges explode. Despite knowing it is a trap, set up by Discord, Andy and her team go to disarm the charges and take out the invaders inside the nuclear facility. Everyone on Andy's team, except for Nile, Booker and Andy, are captured by Discord. During the ensuing melee, the wounded Booker successfully transfers his immortal powers to Andy, and sacrifices his life to protect her. Andy is devastated, but her immortal powers have been restored. Meanwhile, Nile confronts Quỳnh inside the reactor core and injures her, removing her regenerative healing power, before she too is captured by Discord. After convincing the now mortal Quỳnh to release the detonator, Andy catches up to Discord and the two engage in a brutal brawl against one another. Discord reveals that she, too, has lost her immortality, and she is desperate to use Nile to regain her powers—by any means necessary. She stabs Andy in the heart, momentarily incapacitating her, allowing Discord to flee the facility with Andy's captured comrades, and proclaims that if they meet again, she will be immortal. Andy takes Quỳnh back to Tuah's library and helps her recover from her wounds. There, Andy and Quỳnh vow to find Discord together and save their teammates.",

    "title": "Nosferatu",
    "plot": "In the early 1800s, a young girl named Ellen prays for a companion to ease her loneliness. She inadvertently contacts a powerful being known as the Nosferatu, forging a psychic link between them. In 1838, Ellen has married Thomas Hutter, and the couple live in the German town of Wisburg. Thomas accepts a lucrative commission from his employer, Herr Knock, to sell the decrepit Grünewald Manor to the reclusive Count Orlok. Ellen relates her nightmares to him, seeing them as a bad omen, and pleads for Thomas to stay, but he gently dismisses her concerns. He leaves her in the care of his wealthy friend Friedrich Harding and his pregnant wife Anna, along with their two young daughters, Clara and Louise. Arriving at a hamlet in the Carpathians of Transylvania, Thomas is shunned by the locals. He manages to rent a room at the inn and is warned by an old woman not to visit Orlok. That night, he witnesses a group of Roma exhuming and staking an alleged vampire's corpse, which gushes blood. He wakes up to the hamlet deserted and his horse gone. Thomas continues on foot until an unmanned carriage carries him to Orlok's castle. Upon their meeting, the strange and menacing Orlok forces Thomas to complete the property sale. Orlok demonstrates preternatural abilities that unsettle Thomas. The following night, Orlok deceives Thomas into signing a document dissolving his marriage to Ellen and takes his locket, containing a lock of her hair. Thomas discovers a bite on his chest and becomes increasingly ill and fearful. He demands to leave, but Orlok rebuffs him and insists that he remain and recover before departing. Thomas drifts in and out of sleep, finding more bite marks on his chest. He attempts to escape the castle but instead ends up in a crypt where he finds the Count asleep in a coffin, his body naked and decayed. He attacks Orlok with a pickaxe, but Orlok awakens and, alongside his hounds, pursues Thomas. Thomas falls into a river beneath the castle, from which he is recovered and cared for by Eastern Orthodox nuns at a nearby church. They explain that Orlok was a solomonar, who became a vampire after making a pact with the Devil. Orlok sets sail for Wisburg inside his coffin on a ship with plague-carrying rats, killing the crew during the voyage. During Thomas's absence, Ellen, under Orlok's influence, begins suffering from seizures and sleepwalking, which her doctor, Wilhelm Sievers, struggles to treat. Sievers consults with his former mentor, Albin Eberhart von Franz, a Swiss scientist ostracised for his occult beliefs. After visiting Ellen, Von Franz confirms that she is indeed under the Nosferatu's demonic influence, though the Hardings are sceptical. Knock is institutionalized after killing and eating sheep raw. Sievers and von Franz search Knock's office, believing he serves the Nosferatu, who they discover is Orlok. Von Franz later divulges the one constant method of killing the creatures - the Nosferatu must return to the earth in which they were buried. Thomas returns to Wisborg as Orlok's plague ravages the populace. Knock escapes, killing a porter, and escorts Orlok to Grünewald Manor. Orlok appears to Ellen in her nightmares and informs her how Thomas annulled their marriage. He then demands that she submit to him in three days or he will kill everyone she loves, including Thomas. She awakes in horror to find Anna being attacked by plague-infested rats. Harding refuses to heed Ellen's warning and, after an argument, he kicks both her and Thomas out. Thomas insists that they leave the city for Ellen's safety, prompting her to disclose her past with Orlok. She then berates him for allowing Orlok to take advantage of him and annul their marriage. After goading him in a fit of demonic possession, they engage in troubled sex. Orlok retaliates by killing Anna and her children. Harding initially blames Thomas and Ellen, but upon seeing Orlok's bite marks on his friend, he acknowledges that they were telling the truth. Driven mad with grief, Harding dies from the plague while violating his wife's corpse. Von Franz's research suggests that a fair maiden's willing sacrifice can destroy Nosferatu. Knowing that only she can stop the plague, Ellen conspires with von Franz to keep Thomas away. Thomas, von Franz, and Sievers go to Grünewald Manor, where they accidentally kill Knock after finding him sleeping in Orlok's coffin. Realizing von Franz's deception, Thomas rushes back to save Ellen as von Franz destroys the vault. Ellen summons Orlok to her bedroom and re-pledges herself to him, allowing him to feed on her until sunrise. Distracted by Ellen and unable to flee, Orlok is killed by the rising sunlight. Thomas returns moments later and holds Ellen's hand as she dies, while von Franz confirms that her sacrifice has freed them from the plague of Nosferatu.",

    "plot": "Dr. Reed Richards, along with his friend, Ben Grimm, convinces Dr. Victor Von Doom, CEO of Von Doom Industries, to allow him access to his space station to test the effects of exposure of clouds of cosmic energy on biological samples. Victor agrees and recruits his chief genetics researcher (and Reed's ex-girlfriend) Susan Storm and her reckless brother Johnny Storm. They arrive in space to study the cosmic clouds, but the clouds arrive ahead of schedule. Reed, Susan, and Johnny leave the shielded station to rescue Ben, out on a space walk to place the samples, while Victor closes the shields behind them to keep himself protected. The storm breaks through the station and strikes the four. They return home but soon begin to develop strange powers. Reed is able to stretch like rubber, Susan can become invisible and create force fields, Johnny can engulf himself in fire, and Ben is transformed into a large, rock-based creature with superhuman strength and durability. Victor meanwhile faces a backlash from his stockholders due to the publicity from the failed mission. On the Brooklyn Bridge, Ben accidentally causes a traffic pile-up while stopping a man from committing suicide. The four use their various powers to contain the damage and save lives. While the public cheers them for their efforts, Ben's fiancée arrives to silently split their engagement, unable to accept him for his condition. Reed vows to a heartbroken Ben to reverse the effects. The media dubs them \"The Fantastic Four,\" and Victor exploits the news story to his stockholders, but they decide to pull out of Von Doom Industries. The four move into Reed's lab in the Baxter Building to study their abilities and work on finding a cure. Victor offers his support in their efforts but blames Reed for the mission's failure. Reed plans to construct a machine to re-create the storm and reverse their conditions. However, Johnny refuses to cooperate, insisting they should just embrace their powers. Meanwhile, Victor, having also been affected by the storm due to the shields' malfunctioning, begins mutating into organic metal that is able to produce electricity, and begins plotting to use his new powers to take his revenge. Victor drives a wedge between Ben and Reed, resulting in Ben walking out in a rage. This motivates Reed to attempt the machine on himself, but he cannot generate enough power to push the storm to critical mass. Victor hears this and brings Ben to the lab. Ben is placed in the machine and Victor uses his abilities to produce the electricity needed to power it, turning Ben back to normal and accelerating Victor's condition, causing much of his body to turn to metal. Victor knocks the human Ben unconscious and kidnaps Reed. Victor, now calling himself \"Doom,\" tortures Reed using a super-cooling unit and fires a heat-seeking missile at the Baxter Building to kill Johnny. He flies through the city to evade it, lighting a garbage barge on fire to trick it. Sue rushes to free Reed and battles Doom but is outmatched. Ben arrives to help, transformed into The Thing again by reusing the machine. The battle spills into the streets, and the four assemble to battle Doom. Johnny and Sue combine their powers to wrap Doom in an inferno of intense flames, and Ben and Reed douse him with cold water, inducing thermal shock and freezing Doom in place. In an epilogue, Ben tells Reed to forget about his experiment with the machine, as he has accepted his condition through his relationship with Alicia Masters, a blind artist. The team decides to embrace their roles as superheroes, and Reed proposes to Sue. Meanwhile, a frozen Doom is transported back to his homeland of Latveria.",

Shelly, a musician with similar issues, receives a video on her cell phone from her friend Zadie that incriminates Vincent Roeg, a crime lord posing as a musical aristocrat. Choosing to save the video, despite knowing that possessing it would lead to her death, Shelly attempts to go into hiding but is immediately pursued by Roeg's henchmen. They break their pursuit when Shelly is arrested for drug possession. Zadie is captured and interrogated by Roeg. He reveals that, centuries earlier, he had made a pact with the Devil to send innocent souls to Hell in exchange for eternal life. He forces Zadie to kill herself by whispering incantations in her ear. Shelly is sent to the same rehab center where Eric is situated. The two become smitten with each other and bond over time. When Marion, Roeg's right-hand woman, suddenly appears at the institution, Shelly panics and convinces Eric to help her escape. They take refuge in the vacant home of one of Shelly's friends, and the two quickly fall in love and attempt to live a carefree life together, but are soon found by Roeg's men and murdered. Eric awakens in a purgatory-like rail yard where Kronos, a spirit guide, explains that Eric will have to kill Roeg to be reunited with Shelly. Revived and possessing the ability to heal from injuries, Eric visits Sophia, Shelly's mother, who was present with Marion at the rehab center. Sophia reveals that she made a deal with Roeg: wealth in exchange for Shelly's soul. After Eric leaves, Roeg visits Sophia to inquire about Eric but forces her to jump off the roof when she revealed she regretted their deal. Eric proceeds to hunt down and kill several of Roeg's men and finds Shelly's phone with the incriminating video revealing that Roeg had previously forced Shelly to kill a woman. Suddenly doubting his love for Shelly, Eric loses his ability to heal and is again killed. Returned to the afterlife, Eric makes a deal with Kronos to take Shelly's place in Hell in exchange for another chance to kill Roeg. Roeg learns of Eric's supernatural abilities and orders Marion to lure him to them in order to seize Eric's powers. Eric tracks Marion to an opera house, savagely killing all of Roeg's men to reach her. Marion reluctantly discloses Roeg's location before Eric decapitates her. Roeg subdues Eric and attempts to steal his powers before Eric transports them both to the afterlife, where he quickly finishes Roeg and saves Shelly's soul. After a brief reunion between the lovers, Shelly is revived on the night of their deaths and mourns for Eric after Kronos, disguised as a medic, tells her that he gave his life for her. Eric accepts his fate, content in his belief that their souls will one day find each other again.",

    "title": "Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore",
    "plot": "Albus Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald briefly meet in a Muggle teashop, where they acknowledge their mutual feelings. Grindelwald vows to destroy the Muggle world, but Dumbledore denounces the plan as madness, saying he only supported it because he was in love with Grindelwald. In 1932, Kweilin prefecture of China, Newt Scamander helps a qilin — a magical creature that can see into one's soul as well as the future — give birth. Apparating in, Credence leads Rosier and Carrow to attack and kill the mother, then kidnap the newborn. Unbeknownst to them, the qilin has twins, the younger of which Newt saves before collapsing exhausted. A wyvern from his travelling menagerie flies them all away. Grindelwald's acolytes arrive to Nurmengard and give Grindelwald the qilin; he cuts its throat, intending to harness its ability of precognition. Queenie Goldstein surreptitiously observes his actions with shock and later talks with Credence and confesses that she does not tell Grindelwald everything. Unable to battle Grindelwald due to a blood pact they formed when young, Albus Dumbledore recruits Newt and his brother Theseus, who runs the aurors in Britain, to thwart Grindelwald's plan for world domination. After Queenie's defection to Grindelwald, Jacob Kowalski is continuing with his life as baker, but his heart is not in it. On behalf of Dumbledore, Ilvermorny Charms teacher Lally Hicks recruits Jacob. Using a book portkey, they travel to a Berlin-bound train to join Newt. Tina Goldstein is very busy with heading up the Ministry of Magic and so cannot join them. Newt relays Dumbledore's plan to defeat Grindelwald to them, along with Theseus, Senegalese-French wizard Yusuf Kama, and Newt's assistant Bunty Broadacre. He gives Jacob a fake wand; Theseus, a red and gold tie; Lally, a book; and Bunty, a note. In Berlin, despite Newt's attempt to persuade him into doing otherwise on Dumbledore's behalf, the outgoing Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards (ICW) Anton Vogel acquits Grindelwald of all previous criminal charges, allowing him to run in the elections for the head of the ICW in a three-way competition against Vicência Santos and Liu Tao. Grindelwald and his acolytes have already infiltrated and undermined the German Ministry of Magic and they arrest Theseus. Dumbledore apparates into Berlin and dispatches Newt to the Erkstag, the secret German wizarding prison where Theseus is held. Using his talents with creatures, Newt and Theseus flee from a giant manticore in the heart of Erkstag and use a tie portkey to escape. Bunty goes off to have Newt's suitcase copied with six identical ones. Yusuf is planted as a spy in Grindelwald's inner circle. Grindelwald has Queenie use her legilimency to test Yusuf's trustworthiness, believing her validation. Credence tracks down in the streets of Berlin and, in a mirror world, battles Dumbledore, but is quickly disarmed by the much more able older man. Credence reveals that his birth name was Aurelius and he learns he is the illegitimate son of Albus's younger brother, Aberforth Dumbledore and he starts to question his loyalty to Grindelwald. Aberforth and Credence have been writing to each other through mirrors and Albus has been watching Credence in mirrors. Grindelwald plots to assassinate the competing Brazilian candidate, Santos, but Lally uses Jacob with his fake wand as a diversion to successfully prevent this and escape using Dumbledore's book portkey afterwards. Jacob is then framed for attempting to murder Grindelwald, who uses this to justify the suppression of all Muggles. Wizarding world leaders gather in Bhutan for the election of a new Supreme Mugwump of the ICW. At it, there is a \"Walk of the Qilin\" ritual, where a qilin will judge who (if any) of the candidates is pure of heart, takes place, after which the witches and wizards around the world will cast their votes. Using necromancy, Grindelwald reanimates the dead qilin and, knowing Dumbledore and Newt will bring the surviving qilin twin to the ritual, gives Credence a last chance to redeem himself by destroying it. To thwart Grindelwald's cohorts, each ally of Dumbledore carries an identical suitcase, with only one containing the qilin. After reconvening at Hogwarts, the team travel one by one, each with a duplicate suitcase, via a portkey to the ICW vote in Bhutan. On arrival, they are confronted by Grindelwald's followers who target the cases, but Dumbledore has booby-trapped them. Jacob convinces Queenie to come back from Grindelwald, but they are caught. Vogel uses the manipulated dead qilin to bow to Grindelwald during the selection ceremony, and so the latter is subsequently elected as the new Supreme Mugwump. Whereupon, he declares war on all Muggles and tortures Jacob with the Cruciatus curse. Credence reveals that Grindelwald's qilin is dead. Bunty, who has the real suitcase, produces the surviving qilin. The election is voided so a new, fair election can occur. The living qilin passes by Grindelwald and bows to Dumbledore. Shocked, Dumbledore thanks the qilin for the honor but convinces it that there is another equally worthy. The qilin goes on to bow to Santos, who is then elected as the new Supreme Mugwump instead. Enraged, Grindelwald tries to kill Credence, who is simultaneously protected by Aberforth and Albus. Dumbledore's and Grindelwald's clashing spells break the blood pact and their ensuing battle results in a stalemate, upon which Grindelwald disapparates. In the aftermath, Aberforth accepts the dying Credence as his son and takes him home to Hogsmeade. At his New York bakery, Jacob and Queenie have a small wedding ceremony with a few guests. While preparing his speech, Newt steps outside as Tina Goldstein arrives and spots Dumbledore watching from across the street. Dumbledore thanks Newt before disappearing into the night.",

    "title": "The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1",
    "plot": "Several months after the events of the previous film, human Bella Swan and vampire Edward Cullen are getting married. During the reception, werewolf Jacob Black, who had left town upon receiving his invitation to the wedding, returns, much to Bella's delight. They share a dance in the woods, where Bella says that she and Edward plan to consummate their marriage on their honeymoon while she is still human. Jacob becomes furious, fearing that such an act could kill her. After the wedding, Bella and Edward travel to an island off the coast of Rio de Janeiro for their honeymoon, and they make love for the first time. Two weeks later, Bella vomits after waking and realises her period is late. She informs Carlisle Cullen, a medical doctor and Edward's adoptive father, that she believes she is pregnant. Edward is distraught, as it is highly unlikely a human could survive giving birth to a vampire's baby. He encourages Bella to receive an abortion from Carlisle. She refuses and convinces Edward's sister Rosalie to be her bodyguard. The couple flies back home to Forks, Washington, where Jacob rushes to the Cullens' house to find a pale, underweight, and visibly pregnant Bella. He implores her to terminate the pregnancy immediately, but she refuses. Jacob storms out of the Cullens' residence and meets in the woods with his packmates, including their leader Sam, who soon feels they should kill Bella to ensure her half-vampire child does not harm anyone. Jacob refuses, and he and several other werewolves separate from the pack. As Bella's pregnancy progresses, her health declines rapidly. She soon realizes the fetus is craving blood, so she begins drinking human blood obtained by Carlisle from the hospital, improving her health. As a half-vampire, the fetus's development is far more accelerated than that of a human fetus, and thus Bella's pregnancy progresses at an alarming rate. Edward's resentment for the baby dissolves when he discovers he can read its thoughts. When Bella suddenly goes into labor, Edward, Jacob, and Rosalie begin performing an emergency C-section while Carlisle is out obtaining blood. The procedure is excruciatingly painful, and Bella falls unconscious, though she wakes to find she has delivered a healthy daughter, whom she names Renesmee (a combination of her mother's name and Edward's mother's name). Bella's heart suddenly stops, and Jacob desperately attempts CPR. Edward injects Bella's heart with his venom in an attempt to transform her into a vampire, but his action seems futile as Bella remains lifeless. A distraught Jacob decides to kill Renesmee for apparently causing Bella's death; however, when he looks into the baby's eyes, he \"imprints\" on her: a werewolf phenomenon in which one realizes one's soul-mate. This prevents his pack from killing her as their most absolute law is not to harm anyone who has been imprinted on. Over the course of two days, though still unconscious, Bella's injuries heal and her figure returns to normal. Finally, her eyes open and are blood-red, signifying that she has become a vampire. In a post-credits scene, the Volturi, the keepers of vampire law, receive a letter from Carlisle which summarizes Bella and Edward's wedding and her transformation into a vampire. The Volturi bicker about how Carlisle is growing his coven and that the Volturis' dispute with the Cullens is over. However, their leader mentions that the Cullens still have something he wants.",

    "title": "Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief",
    "plot": "At the top of the Empire State Building, Zeus meets his brother Poseidon. Zeus accuses Poseidon's demigod son, Percy Jackson, of stealing his master lightning bolt. Poseidon reminds him that Percy is unaware of his true identity. However, Zeus declares that unless the bolt is returned to Mount Olympus before midnight of the Summer Solstice, war will be waged between all the gods. 16-year-old Percy struggles with dyslexia and ADHD. On a school trip to the MOMA, he is attacked by Alecto, a Fury masquerading as his substitute English teacher Mrs. Dodds, who demands the bolt. Percy's best friend Grover Underwood and his Latin teacher Mr. Brunner help scare off Alecto. His teacher gives Percy a very powerful cosmic weapon which looks like a pen, and instructs Grover to take him and his mother, Sally to Camp Half-Blood — a secret sanctuary for demigod children on Long Island, leaving behind Sally's abusive husband, Percy's stepfather, Gabe Ugliano. On the way there in Sally's car, they are attacked by the Minotaur, who seemingly kills Percy's mother. Percy discovers the pen is a magical sword, and uses it to fight off the Minotaur, killing it with its own horn and goes into shock. Waking up three days later, Percy learns he is Poseidon's son, Grover is a satyr and Percy's protector, and Mr. Brunner is Chiron, a centaur. He starts coming into his latent demigod powers, which include hydrokinesis and healing, and meets other demigods, including Annabeth Chase, Athena's daughter; and the camp's leader Luke Castellan, Hermes's son. Percy is visited by his uncle Hades's apparition, who reveals that the Minotaur abducted Sally to the Underworld to trade for the bolt. Defying Chiron's orders, Percy sets out for the Underworld with Grover and Annabeth. Luke gives Percy a map with the location of three green pearls belonging to Hades' wife (and Percy's aunt) Persephone, which will allow them to escape the Underworld. He also gives him a pair of flying winged Converse All-Stars stolen from Hermes, and Luke's favorite shield. Meanwhile, Percy is declared missing. At a garden center in New Jersey, with help from Grover and Annabeth, Percy manages to decapitate Medusa and takes the first pearl from her corpse. At the Parthenon in Nashville, Percy uses the shoes to retrieve the second pearl from the crown of a statue of Athena there, and Grover kills a Hydra with Medusa's head. The trio arrives at the Lotus Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas to obtain the third pearl; however, they forget their mission after eating lotus flowers, the effects of which cause them to lose their sense of time. Percy snaps out of the spell after hearing the voice of Poseidon through telepathy telling him not to eat any more flowers. Percy frees Grover and Annabeth from the flowers' effects; they locate the final pearl in the casino and escape. Unfortunately, they only have one day left to prevent the war, as they were in the casino for almost a week. They discover that the Underworld is in Hollywood so race there. With all three pearls, Percy, Grover, and Annabeth enter the portal to the Underworld upon arriving in Hollywood. There, Hades finds the bolt hidden inside Luke's shield, revealing that Luke was the thief all along. Hades tries to kill the trio, but Persephone turns on him in retaliation for imprisoning her and gives the bolt to Percy. As they only have three pearls, Grover remains behind, while Percy, Annabeth, and Sally teleport to the Empire State Building, the secret entrance to Olympus. However, before they can enter, they are ambushed by Luke, who reveals that he stole the bolt to demolish Olympus and establish the demigods (and himself) as Olympus' new rulers. After a battle across Manhattan, Percy defeats Luke, returns the bolt to Zeus, and reconciles with his father. Having been reunited with Grover, Percy and Annabeth continue to train back at Camp Half-Blood. In a mid-credits scene, Sally has kicked Gabe out of their apartment. When going to the locked refrigerator to get a drink, he ignores Percy's written warning to not open it, breaks it open, and is turned into stone by Medusa's head, which he kept inside.",

    "title": "Thor",
    "plot": "In 965 AD, Odin, king of Asgard, wages war against the Frost Giants of Jotunheim and their leader Laufey, to prevent them from conquering the Nine Realms, starting with Earth. The Asgardians defeat the Frost Giants and seize the source of their power, the Casket of Ancient Winters. In the present, Odin's son Thor prepares to ascend to the throne of Asgard but is interrupted when Frost Giants, secretly allowed in by his brother Loki, attempt to retrieve the Casket. Against Odin's order, Thor travels to Jotunheim to confront Laufey, accompanied by Loki, childhood friend Sif and the Warriors Three: Volstagg, Fandral, and Hogun. A battle ensues until Odin intervenes to save the Asgardians, destroying the fragile truce between the two races. As punishment for Thor's arrogance, Odin deems his son unworthy and strips his powers before exiling him to Earth as a mortal, accompanied by his hammer Mjölnir, now protected by an enchantment that allows only the worthy to wield it. Thor lands in New Mexico, where astrophysicist Dr. Jane Foster, her assistant Darcy Lewis, and mentor Dr. Erik Selvig find him. The local populace discovers Mjölnir, which S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson soon commandeers before forcibly acquiring Foster's data about the wormhole that delivered Thor to Earth. Having learned about Mjölnir's nearby location, Thor seeks to retrieve it from the facility that S.H.I.E.L.D. has constructed and tries to lift it, but is unable to do so and is captured. With Selvig's help, he is freed and resigns himself to exile on Earth as he develops a romance with Foster. Loki discovers that he is Laufey's biological son, adopted by Odin after the war ended. Loki confronts Odin, who wearily falls into the deep \"Odinsleep\" to recover his strength. Loki takes the throne in Odin's stead and offers Laufey the chance to kill Odin and retrieve the Casket. Sif and the Warriors Three, unhappy with Loki's rule, attempt to return Thor from exile, convincing Heimdall, gatekeeper of the Bifröst—the means of traveling between worlds—to allow them passage to Earth. Aware and suspicious of their plan, Loki sends the Destroyer, a seemingly indestructible automaton, to pursue them and kill Thor. The warriors find Thor, but the Destroyer attacks and overpowers them, prompting Thor to offer himself instead. Struck by the Destroyer and near death, Thor proves himself worthy to wield Mjölnir. The hammer returns to him, restoring his powers and enabling him to defeat the Destroyer. Thor and Jane kiss each other goodbye before he leaves with his fellow Asgardians to confront Loki. In Asgard, Loki betrays and kills Laufey. Thor arrives, and Loki reveals his plan to destroy Jotunheim with the Bifröst Bridge. Thor fights Loki before destroying the Bifröst Bridge to stop Loki's plan.

    "plot": "In Thebes, Egypt, 1290 BC, the high priest Imhotep has an affair with Pharaoh Seti I's mistress Anck-su-namun. The pair kill the Pharaoh after he discovers the pair's transgressions. When the Pharaoh's bodyguards, the Medjai, arrive, Anck-su-namun takes her own life while Imhotep flees. Imhotep and his priests steal her corpse and travel to Hamunaptra, the City of the Dead, to conduct a ritual to resurrect her, but the Medjai intervene. As punishment, Imhotep's priests are mummified alive, while Imhotep himself is cursed and buried alive with flesh-eating scarabs. The Medjai are sworn to prevent Imhotep's return, as his resurrection would grant him immense power. In 1926 AD Cairo, Kingdom of Egypt, Jonathan Carnahan presents his sister, Evelyn—a librarian and aspiring Egyptologist working for museum curator Dr. Terence Bey—with an intricate box and map that lead to Hamunaptra, the existence of which is now considered a myth along with the treasures believed to reside there. Jonathan reveals he stole the box from American adventurer and treasure hunter, Rick O'Connell, who discovered the city while in the French Foreign Legion. Evelyn bargains with corrupt prison warden Gad Hassan to free an incarcerated Rick, in exchange for the American leading them to Hamunaptra where she hopes to find the golden Book of Amun-Ra. The group soon finds themselves competing with another expedition, guided by Rick's cowardly fellow former Legionnaire Beni Gabor. They are repeatedly intercepted by Medjai, whose leader Ardeth Bay cautions them to leave. They ignore Bay's warnings; the two expeditions continue to dig through the ruins, resulting in numerous fatalities that include Hassan being killed by a scarab he inadvertently releases, as well as some workers who are melted by an acid trap that was intentionally left behind to deter future excavation. Both expeditions come into conflict over a statue which is believed to hold the golden book. Within the statue, however, the competing groups come across the Book of the Dead as well as five canopic jars, while Evelyn, Rick, and Jonathan accidentally discover Imhotep's mummified remains. That night, Evelyn steals the Book of the Dead from the rival camp, accidentally awakening the mummified Imhotep when she reads the text contained within. Following a confrontation with the now resurrected Imhotep as well as the Medjai, the expeditions flee back to Cairo. Imhotep spares Beni's life to serve as a translator in exchange for treasure when the mummy realises that he can speak Hebrew. Imhotep follows the expeditions back to Cairo and unleashes the biblical Plagues of Egypt. Those who discovered the canopic jars are hunted and killed by Imhotep, restoring his human form and strengthening his power. Attempting to find answers at the museum, the survivors instead find Ardeth being hosted by Dr. Bey, a fellow Medji. The group surmises that Imhotep desires to resurrect Anck-su-namun using Evelyn as a human sacrifice, and that the only way to stop him is to return to Hamunaptra and find the Book of Amun-Ra. The group are soon cornered by Imhotep and a now enthralled city populace, which results in Evelyn's capture while Dr. Bey sacrifices himself to allow the others to escape. The remaining three convince Rick's old friend, Royal Air Force Captain Winston Havelock, to fly them to Hamunaptra. Imhotep conjures a magical sandstorm, crashing their plane and killing Havelock. After reaching the city on foot, Rick and Jonathan find the Book of Amun-Ra, while Ardeth is overwhelmed fighting Imhotep's resurrected servants. Jonathan and Rick reach the ritual chamber, where Rick frees Evelyn, and Jonathan uses the book to control the resurrected servants, leading to the death of a partially resurrected Anck-su-namun. Evelyn then uses the book to make Imhotep mortal, allowing Rick to fatally impale him; Imhotep decomposes back to his mummified form as he sinks into a pool of liquid, swearing vengeance in the process. Meanwhile, Beni, who had been pilfering treasure from Hamunaptra, inadvertently triggers a booby-trap, causing the city to start collapsing. Rick, Evie and Jonathan escape while Beni is buried inside and devoured by scarabs. Outside, the group discover Ardeth survived, and he bids them farewell as they depart, unknowingly with some of Beni's plundered loot.",

    "plot": "Krank (Daniel Emilfork), a highly intelligent but malicious being created by a vanished scientist, is unable to dream, which causes him to age prematurely. At his lair on an abandoned oil rig (which he shares with the scientist's other creations: six childish clones, a dwarf named Martha, and a brain in a vat named Irvin) he uses a dream-extracting machine to steal dreams from children. The children are kidnapped for him from a nearby port city by a cyborg cult called the Cyclops, whom in exchange he supplies with mechanical eyes and ears. Among the kidnapped is Denrée (Joseph Lucien), the adopted little brother of carnival strongman One (Ron Perlman). After the carnival manager is stabbed by a mugger, One is hired by a criminal gang of orphans (run by a pair of conjoined twins called \"the Octopus\") to help them steal a safe. The theft is successful, but the safe is lost in the harbor when One is distracted by seeing Denrée's kidnappers. He, together with one of the orphans, a little girl called Miette (Judith Vittet), follows the Cyclops and infiltrates their headquarters, but they are captured and sentenced to execution. Meanwhile, the Octopus orders circus performer Marcello (Jean-Claude Dreyfus) to return One to them. He uses his trained fleas, which inject a poison capsule that causes mindless aggression, to turn the Cyclops guards against each other. While Marcello is rescuing One, Miette falls into the harbor and sinks, seemingly drowned, but an amnesiac diver living beneath the harbor rescues her. Miette leaves the diver's lair to find One and Marcello both drowning their sorrows in a bar. Upon seeing Miette alive, the remorseful Marcello lets One leave with her. However, the Octopus confronts them on the pier, and uses Marcello's stolen fleas to turn One against Miette. A spectacular chain of events triggered by one of Miette's tears leads to a ship crashing into the pier before One can throttle her. Marcello arrives and sets the fleas on the Octopus, allowing One and Miette to escape to continue searching for Denrée. Back at Krank's oil rig, Irvin tricks one of the clones into releasing a plea for help in the form of a bottled dream telling the story of what is going on on the oil rig. It reaches One, Miette, and the diver, and the latter remembers that he was the scientist who made them, and that the oil rig was his laboratory before Krank and Martha attacked him and pushed him off it to take it for themselves, leaving him for dead in the water. They all converge on the rig; the diver to destroy it and the duo to rescue Denrée. Miette is almost killed by Martha, who is harpooned to death by the diver, pretending her \"allergy to iron\". Miette then finds Denrée asleep in Krank's dream-extracting machine, and Irvin tells her that to release him she must use the machine to enter the dream herself. In the dream world, she meets Krank and makes a deal with him to replace the boy as the source of the dream; Krank fears a trap but plays along, believing himself to be in control. Miette then uses her imagination to control the dream and turn it into an infinite loop, destroying Krank's mind. One and Miette rescue all the children, while the now-deranged diver loads the rig with dynamite and straps himself to one of its legs. The diver regains his senses as everyone is rowing away and pleads with his remaining creations to come back to rescue him, but a seabird lands on the handle of the blasting machine, blowing up him and the rig.",

    "plot": "The first king of Aurea leads a futile attack on a dragon residing in his realm. All the king's men are killed, leaving the king at the Dragon's mercy. Centuries later, Elodie, the daughter of Lord Bayford, receives a proposal from Queen Isabelle of Aurea to marry her son, Prince Henry. On her father's urging, Elodie agrees to the marriage so her bride price can help their impoverished people. Upon arriving in Aurea, Elodie and Henry are initially uninterested in each other, but begin to bond as they share a desire to travel. Elodie's stepmother, Lady Bayford, becomes suspicious of the motives of Queen Isabelle, leading her to futilely implore Elodie to end the engagement. After the wedding, Elodie and Henry take part in an ancient ritual in the mountains, supposedly to celebrate their union. Isabelle describes the pact between the first king and the Dragon, where he had to sacrifice his three daughters to ensure peace between his people and the dragon. Following a ceremony where their palms are cut and held together, Henry carries Elodie across the narrow path over the Dragon's lair, then at Isabelle's behest throws her down the chasm. Recovering from the fall and having been rendered barefoot, Elodie realizes that she is an actual sacrifice. She escapes the Dragon after it burns her leg, and discovers an illuminated cave filled with glowing silk worms, which she collects as a light source. Elodie reaches a chamber with the note \"Safe Here She Cannot Reach\", the names of past victims, and a map carved into the wall. While Elodie sleeps, the worms heal the burn on her leg. Elodie follows the map to a dead end at a high vertical drop on the mountainside. She discovers the remains of dead dragon hatchlings, explaining the reason for the royal sacrifices. A rescue party led by Lord Bayford arrives. The Dragon kills them, including Lord Bayford, but the distraction allows Elodie to escape the mountain. She takes one of the rescue party's horses and hides under a rock as the Dragon burns the surrounding area in an unsuccessful pursuit. Alerted by the conflagration that Elodie's sacrifice has failed, Isabelle resorts to kidnapping Elodie's younger sister Floria as a replacement. After learning this from a desperate Lady Bayford, Elodie returns to the mountain to rescue Floria, whom the Dragon has left alive as bait. Elodie creates a diversion to reach Floria. Telling her sister to hide, she confronts the Dragon and tries to convince her that they were deceived by the Aureans: by joining their cut hands at the wedding, the blood of the brides and the Aurean royals mingled, making the Dragon think that the princesses were of Aurean descent. Refusing to believe Elodie, the Dragon states that the first king's assault was unprovoked, and then attacks her. The two battle until Elodie tricks the Dragon into burning herself. With the Dragon at her mercy, she convinces the Dragon of the truth and heals both of them with the glowing worms. Elodie then interrupts the wedding of another sacrifice at the palace, exposing the Aurean royal family's treachery. Elodie advises the new bride and her family to flee, and the Dragon burns the palace with all the Aurean royals and nobles inside. Henry, remorseful for his actions, is shown to accept his fate. Days later, Elodie, Floria, and Lady Bayford sail home, loaded with supplies and accompanied by the Dragon.",

    "plot": "As a child, Diana participates in an athletic competition on Themyscira against adult Amazons. After being knocked off her horse, she takes a shortcut and remounts, but misses a checkpoint. Antiope removes her from the race for cheating, explaining that anything worthwhile must be obtained honestly, while her mother Hippolyta advises her to be patient in her pursuit of glory and honor. In 1984, Diana is working at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., while secretly performing heroic deeds as Wonder Woman. New museum employee Barbara Minerva, a shy geologist and cryptozoologist, has trouble getting noticed by her co-workers, but quickly finds a friend in Diana. The FBI asks the museum to identify stolen antiquities from a robbery that Wonder Woman recently foiled; Barbara and Diana notice a Latin inscription on one artifact (the Dreamstone) claiming to grant the holder one wish. Neither one openly takes the inscription seriously, but after Diana saves Barbara from an assailant by secretly using her powers, Barbara wishes she was strong, sexy, and cool \"like\" Diana and thus unintentionally acquires the same superpowers. Because Diana yearns for Steve Trevor, her lover who died heroically, he is resurrected in another man's body and they are reunited. Failing businessman Maxwell \"Max Lord\" Lorenzano recognizes the Dreamstone, and hopes to use its power to save his nearly bankrupt oil company. His wish is to \"become\" the stone and gain its powers: whenever he grants someone else's desire, he can take what he wants from the wisher. This soon results in worldwide chaos, destruction, and instability. Diana discovers that the Dreamstone was created by Dolos/Mendacius, The God of Lies, also known as the Duke of Deception. It grants a user's wish, but exacts an equally strong toll unless they renounce the wish or destroy the stone. Although Diana's powers and Barbara's humanity begin to diminish, neither is willing to renounce her wish. Max visits the U.S. President, who wishes for more nuclear missiles as protection against the Soviets, but these are detected, bringing the world to the brink of nuclear war. Max also learns of a new and secret satellite system that can broadcast to everyone in the world simultaneously. Since his powers are causing his body to deteriorate, he plans to grant wishes globally to steal strength and life force from the viewers and regain his health. Diana and Steve confront him, but Barbara sides with Max, overpowering Diana and escaping with him on Marine One. Steve convinces Diana to renounce her wish and let him go, restoring her to full strength. Donning the armor of Asteria, the greatest of all Amazon warriors, Diana flies to the satellite headquarters and again battles Barbara, who has transformed into a humanoid cheetah after wishing to become an apex predator. After a brutal fight that ends in a lake, Diana overcomes Barbara with an electric shock, then pulls her out of the water. Diana confronts Max and uses her Lasso of Truth to communicate with the world through him, persuading everyone to renounce their wish. She then shows him visions of his unhappy childhood and of his son, Alistair, who is frantically searching for his father amid the chaos. Realizing the error of his ways, Max renounces his wish and reunites with Alistair, simultaneously renouncing everyone else's wishes, and turning Barbara back to normal. In the present day, it is winter, and Diana meets the man whose body Steve possessed. In a mid-credits scene, Asteria is revealed to be alive, living among humans and also secretly heroic.",

    "title": "The Legend of Ochi",
    "plot": "In a remote village on the Black Sea island of Carpathia, local inhabitants have hunted reclusive primate-like creatures known as the Ochi for generations. A fanatical farmer/hunter named Maxim leads a hunting party of mostly young boys, including his disaffected daughter Yuri and reserved son Petro. During one of these hunts, a baby Ochi gets lost and injured and later ends up spotted by Yuri who frees its leg from a trap and treats it back at her home in secret. Discovering it to be a sapient creature instead of the violent monster she was taught Ochi to be after it doesn't eat her pet caterpillar after she asks it not to, she sets off on a journey to return it to its family, with Petro ultimately not intervening despite sees her leave with the baby Ochi due to realizing she has no reason to trust him or the others due to their subservience to their father. When Maxim discovers she's left and finds signs of the Ochi's presence in her room, he rallies the children to find her under the assumption the Ochi have abducted her, despite her having left a note behind along with her grandfather’s knife, a gift from Maxim she rejected. Meanwhile, Petro quietly separates from his father's group to seek out his and Yuri's distant mother Dasha who lives in a cabin in the mountains and had previously left Maxim after they'd come a disagreement regarding the Ochi. Coming upon a supermarket she was never allowed to enter by Maxim, Yuri ventures inside with the baby Ochi only for it to quickly be discovered, causing a commotion that ends with Yuri stealing a car after being bitten by the baby Ochi in a panic, poisoning her arm. As they take refuge near a pond, a weakening Yuri discovers she can understand and replicate the baby Ochi's vocalizations before she falls into a caged hole in the ground. Yuri is found by Dasha who treats her injuries at her home with the blood of the Carpathian brown bats that have developed an immunity to Ochi venom having previously lost her own hand after a similar incident, forcing her to use a prosthetic after Maxim cut her arm off. She corrects Yuri's assumption that the venom was what allowed her to understand the Ochi's language, stating she had shown it to her as a baby, having been studying it herself and its similarity to music. The two lament the Ochi's deep connection to each other compared to their failure to connect with other humans, though Yuri leaves angrily after Dasha refuses to aid her in returning the baby Ochi to its family despite having mapped out their territory, as she concludes they would reject it for being near humans and kill her for encroaching on their territory. Maxim and his group arrive at the cabin in search of Yuri, having been called in by Petro, who'd seen Dasha with Yuri earlier. Dasha talks with Maxim inside as he tries to insist he still loves her and cares for his family while she rebukes him for his militant ways, the indoctrination of children, and what he did to her hand. Their conversation turns violent as Maxim discovers Dasha let her go, blaming her for leaving their family and she drives him out of her house, only stopping due to being held at gunpoint by Maxim's hunters, who've raided her storage space to find her maps of the Ochi's territory. While ecstatic to finally know where their territory really is, Maxim is horrified to realize Yuri is headed there. Yuri manages to reunite with the baby Ochi after using his language. As they make camp, the baby Ochi speaks about missing its mother while Yuri claims to not miss her own, frustrated by both her parents. Dasha comes to regret her coldness towards Yuri, seeing it as her taking her anger towards Maxim out on her, and ventures to find her. Upset by his encounter with his former wife, Maxim advises Petro to not rely on anyone, as he believes it leads to weakness. Yuri manages to construct a makeshift raft for herself and the baby Ochi to travel down a river into a cave system where the Ochi live. They see Yuri and the baby Ochi approach through holes in the mountain, but close them up with rocks after seeing Yuri. The two are then shot at by the hunters, causing them to fall into the water and nearly drown before they manage to climb onto a nearby rock. Disgusted at Maxim being completely callous to her almost dying because of his hunters and his clumsy attempts to connect with her, Yuri jumps into the river with the baby Ochi and swims into the caves. Petro finally stand up to Maxim for driving his family away with his obsession with the Ochi, but he dismisses him and decides to head into the cave alone to not endanger the children, removing his ceremonial armor to allow him to swim. In the caves, armed with an axe, Maxim searches for Yuri, who evades him, the pair being noticed by nearby Ochi, who are angered at the presence of outsiders. After Maxim’s leg stuck inside a pile of logs, Yuri goes back to help him. Unable to push the log off him, she calls for the Ochi in their language, startling Maxim. Yuri apologizes for having rejected Maxim's gift to her and asks her to trust him even if he doesn’t understand her, while he solemnly admits he bought it as a gas station because he wanted to impress her. He and the baby Ochi interact and he ceases hostilities with it, as Yuri manages to free him. The boys head into a cave on a log, coming across Dasha, who observes cave paintings made by the Ochi depicting their violent history with humans. Yuri, Maxim and the baby Ochi head to the center of the mountain, where there is a large clearing the Ochi live. Noticing the boys have taken a sniper position on a nearby cliff edge, Maxim attempts to diffuse the situation only for the boys to open fire anyway as Petro lunges towards one of the boys. The angered Ochi are calmed by Dasha's use of a flute to simulate their language, followed by Yuri using their language, allowing her and Maxim to peacefully return the baby Ochi to its mother. Dasha then makes amends with Yuri as the Ochi vocalize around them in celebration.",

    "plot": "In Mexico, a scavenger discovers the tip of the spear that pierced Jesus Christ and, after becoming possessed, takes it to Los Angeles. There, cynical occult expert John Constantine exorcises a demon from a young girl after witnessing its attempt to reach Earth through her, something that should be impossible because of the treaty between Heaven and Hell. Suffering from terminal lung cancer, Constantine meets with the half-breed angel Gabriel to request an extension to his life in exchange for his work deporting Hell's forces. Gabriel responds that performing good deeds for selfish reasons will not secure his way into Heaven. Meanwhile, detective Angela Dodson investigates the death of her twin sister Isabel, who leaped from a psychiatric hospital roof. Angela refuses to believe her sister, a devout Catholic, would commit suicide and condemn herself to Hell. Watching security footage, Angela hears Isabel say \"Constantine\", and seeks out his assistance. He refuses to help until he witnesses demons pursuing Angela and fends them off. Constantine then performs a ritual to see Isabel in Hell, confirming she killed herself. He reveals to Angela that he committed suicide as a teenager because of the trauma of seeing supernatural creatures. Although he was revived, his attempt has condemned him to Hell when he eventually dies. At the morgue, Constantine's friend Father Hennessy discovers a mysterious symbol on Isabel's wrist but is killed by the half-breed demon Balthazar. Constantine and Angela later uncover that Hennessy carved the symbol into his own hand for them to find. Angela also discovers a hidden message from Isabel referencing a chapter from Hell's Bible. Before being killed by Balthazar, Constantine's ally Beeman reveals that the symbol represents the antichrist Mammon, Lucifer's son. The chapter foretells Mammon usurping his father and conquering Earth using a powerful psychic and divine assistance; Isabel, a powerful psychic, sacrificed herself to thwart Mammon's plan. Angela confesses that she possessed similar psychic abilities but repressed them to avoid being labeled insane like her sister. To help Angela rediscover her powers, Constantine induces a near-death experience. With her reawakened abilities, Angela locates Balthazar. Constantine interrogates Balthazar, who reveals that the blood of Christ on the spear tip is Mammon's divine assistance, and Angela will be his host. An unseen entity destroys Balthazar and abducts Angela who becomes possessed by Mammon. With the help of witch doctor Papa Midnite, Constantine induces visions to locate Angela at the psychiatric hospital. Alongside his apprentice, Chas Kramer, Constantine arms himself and assaults the building, battling through hordes of demons to Angela. Constantine and Chas seemingly exorcise Mammon from her, but Chas is killed by the unseen force, revealed to be Gabriel. Resentful at God's favoritism for humanity and forgiveness for even the most wicked, Gabriel intends to unleash Hell on Earth so that those who survive will become truly worthy of His love. Gabriel tosses Constantine away and prepares to stab Angela with the spear tip to unleash Mammon. Desperate, Constantine commits suicide by slitting his wrists, knowing that Lucifer will personally come to collect him. Time pauses and Constantine convinces Lucifer to intervene and stop Mammon. Gabriel attempts to smite Lucifer, but is unable to, as Gabriel no longer has God's favor. Lucifer burns Gabriel's wings away while also banishing Mammon back to Hell. He then reluctantly offers to restore Constantine to life for his assistance. Constantine instead asks that Isabel be sent to Heaven. Lucifer releases Isabel and starts dragging Constantine to Hell, but Constantine begins ascending to Heaven for his selfless sacrifice. Infuriated, Lucifer restores Constantine to life and removes his cancer, believing that, in time, Constantine will prove he belongs in Hell. Constantine punches the now-mortal Gabriel before leaving and entrusts Angela with securing the spear tip. In a post-credits scene, Constantine visits Chas's grave and witnesses him in an angelic form.",

While riding the subway home with his colleague Yoo Sang-ah, he receives a message from the author suggesting he write a new ending himself. At 7:00 p.m., the train halts and a dokkaebi named Bi-hyeong appears, announcing that humanity must face scenarios imposed by constellations, beginning with the command to kill one or more living organisms. Realizing the situation mirrors the novel's first episode, Dok-ja kills an ant from a boy named Lee Gil-yeong's insect box to survive. Though he tries to help others, panic leads to bloodshed. As the scenario ends, only Dok-ja, Sang-ah, Gil-yeong, and 14 others survive. All are prompted to choose a sponsor, but Dok-ja refuses. When the train is attacked by a monster, soldier Lee Hyeon-seong, who is one of Joong-hyuk's comrades in the novel, helps Dok-ja and the others escape. Dok-ja sees Joong-hyuk fighting and proposes an alliance to change his fate, knowing Joong-hyuk will die fighting the Fire Dragon. Joong-hyuk refuses and throws Dok-ja off the bridge, where he’s swallowed by an ichthyosaur. Inside, Dok-ja strikes a deal with Bi-hyeong to earn coins and uses thorns from the dokkaebi shop to kill the beast. He trades its nucleus for a rare item, the Ether of Faith. After stopping at a convenience store, Dok-ja saves Jeong Hui-won, a minor character who originally died in the novel. They escape a monster and regroup at Geumho Station with Sang-ah, Hyeon-seong, and Gil-yeong. There, the scenario is to kill all monsters or pay a daily coin fee to survive. Congressman Cheon In-ho, a main antagonist in the novel, urges Dok-ja to share his coins, but Dok-ja sees through his deception. Dok-ja’s group, joined by Hui-won, learns In-ho and his men have been killing others for coins. After Sang-ah is kidnapped by a Ground Rat, Dok-ja kills it using White Star Pure Energy and rescues her and Hyeon-seong, who was trapped in an Illusory Prison by his trauma of witnessing a fellow soldier's death by a grenade accident. The group receives new weapons. Dok-ja gets a broken sword, \"Broken Faith\", which needs the Ether of Faith to become complete. His knowledge of the novel raises suspicion, so he lies, claiming he has prophetic powers. He tells the group they must prevent Joong-hyuk’s death at Chungmu-ro. But first, they must kill the final Geumho monster — In-ho himself, who became a monster by sacrificing his humanity to the constellations. Though he crosses into Chungmu-ro, he is killed at the last second by Lee Ji-hye, Joong-hyuk’s apprentice, saving Dok-ja’s group. At Chungmu-ro, the scenario requires survivors to enter limited green zones each round or be killed by monsters. Dok-ja finds a hidden bonus zone but gives it to Gil-yeong, refusing Joong-hyuk's demand to let the boy die. Dok-ja eats a crystal from the Ground Rat and is pulled into the Illusory Prison, confronting a traumatic high school memory: he was forced by the bullies to fight his only friend Ahn Min-seop and win in order to avoid being bullied, and it led to Min-seop's suicide. He once told the TWSA author he wanted an ending where the protagonist survives with his comrades. Joong-hyuk, speaking through his Dream Conversation ability, rebuffs Dok-ja's idealistic hopes, stating that he used to harbour the same beliefs before the dark side of humanity and loss of his comrades led to him coming to realize that humanity cannot be trusted to help each other and it was easier to fight alone for his own survival. Upon awakening, Dok-ja finds his teammates protected him and survived without the green zones. He now believes they can survive together and decides to fight the Fire Dragon without sacrificing Joong-hyuk. When only one green zone is given to Gong Pil-du, who owns the most coins, Dok-ja offers to buy it. Ji-hye initially refuses to help, choosing to survive alone, but breaks down after Dok-ja confronts her about murdering her best friend in the first scenario. With 113,000 coins, Dok-ja buys and destroys Pil-du's green zone with Ji-hye's help, urging everyone to survive together and also pays Pil-du 100,000 coins, wanting him to protect the other survivors. Pil-du, conflicted but moved, agrees to help and fights alongside Dok-ja’s team. When the Fire Dragon appears, the group attempts a coordinated attack: Dok-ja breaks its shell, Sang-ah restrains it, and Hui-won pierces the core to earn the \"King of No Killing\" ability that can revive Dok-ja, because breaking the shell will lead to Dok-ja's death. But Joong-hyuk dies before the plan succeeds. As the world begins to collapse, Dok-ja receives the notification that his ichthyosaur nucleus is successfully traded in exchange for the Ether of Faith, with the trade initiated by none other than the TWSA author \"tls123\". Dok-ja merges it with Broken Faith to create an Attribute Weapon, kills the Fire Dragon, and revives Joong-hyuk with the King of No Killing, saving the world. Joong-hyuk looks at Dok-ja with gratitude as they and the others celebrate their victory. Dok-ja now aims to write a new ending with the help of his comrades. In a mid-credits scene, Han Myeong-oh, the former superior of Dok-ja, arrives, revealing that Geumho has been destroyed and all survivors except him are dead. As the group prepares for the next scenario, a mysterious train sound echoes in the distance.",

    "plot": "Thorin Oakenshield and his company are being pursued by Azog and his Orc party. They are ushered by Gandalf to the nearby home of Beorn, a skin-changer who can take the form of a bear. That night, Azog is summoned to Dol Guldur by the Necromancer, who commands him to marshal his forces for war. Azog delegates the hunt for Thorin to his son Bolg. After telling the company about the dangers of Mirkwood, including the Necromancer's rise and the Wood-elves being dangerous, Beorn escorts the company to the borders of Mirkwood, where Gandalf discovers Black Speech imprinted on an old ruin. This, and a prior request by Galadriel, prompts him to investigate the tombs of the Nazgûl. Before leaving the company, he warns them to remain on the path. They lose their way in the forest and are ensnared by giant spiders. Bilbo frees the dwarves with the help of the invisibility ring and begins to understand its dark influence when he drops the ring and brutally kills a baby spider to retrieve it. The remaining spiders are killed by the Wood-elves led by Tauriel and Legolas, who capture the Dwarves and bring Thorin before their king, Thranduil. Thorin confronts the king about neglecting the Dwarves of Erebor following Smaug's attack 60 years earlier and is consequently imprisoned with the other Dwarves. Having avoided capture, Bilbo helps them escape in empty wine barrels sent downstream. They are pursued by Wood-elves and ambushed by Bolg and his Orc party, resulting in a three-way battle as they rush down the river in the barrels. The Dwarves escape both groups of pursuers, but Kíli is wounded with a Morgul shaft. Thranduil seals off his kingdom when an Orc captive reveals that an evil army is amassing in the south, but Tauriel decides to leave and assist the Dwarves and Legolas goes after her. Gandalf and Radagast investigate the tombs of the Nazgûl and find them empty. Gandalf discovers that the Nine have been called to Dol Guldur, deducing that Sauron has returned and is preparing for war. The company is smuggled into Esgaroth by a bargeman called Bard. Thorin promises the Master of Laketown a share of the mountain's treasure, and they are given arms and sent off to the mountain. Due to his injury, Kíli is forced to remain behind at Bard's home, tended to by Fíli, Óin, and Bofur. Bilbo discovers the hidden entrance in the Lonely Mountain and is sent inside to retrieve the Arkenstone. However, he accidentally awakens Smaug, who reveals his knowledge of the dwarves' plot. In Laketown, Bard, a descendant of Dale's last ruler, prepares his ancestor's last black arrow in fear of an attack by Smaug, but is arrested by the Master. Bolg and his Orcs infiltrate Laketown and attack the four Dwarves, but Tauriel and Legolas arrive to defeat them, while Bolg escapes. Meanwhile, Gandalf enters Dol Guldur alone after sending Radagast to warn Galadriel of their discovery at the tombs. The Necromancer overpowers Gandalf and reveals himself as Sauron. Gandalf is captured, as he watches helplessly as Azog and an Orc army march from Dol Guldur towards the Lonely Mountain. Inside the mountain, during a long chase, Bilbo and the Dwarves rekindle the mountain's forge using Smaug's flames and melt a large golden statue, hoping to bury Smaug alive in the molten gold. They do so, but Smaug emerges from the gold, stumbles out of the mountain and flies off to destroy Laketown as Bilbo watches in despair.",

    "title": "Sleepy Hollow",
    "plot": "In 1799, New York City police constable Ichabod Crane is dispatched to the upstate Dutch hamlet of Sleepy Hollow, which has been plagued by a series of brutal decapitations: wealthy landowner Peter Van Garrett and his son Dirk, and local widow Emily Winship. Received by the insular town elders—wealthy businessman Baltus Van Tassel; town doctor Thomas Lancaster; the Reverend Steenwyck; notary James Hardenbrook; and magistrate Samuel Philipse—Ichabod learns that locals believe the killer is the undead apparition of a headless Hessian mercenary from the American Revolutionary War who rides a black steed in search of his missing head. Ichabod begins his investigation, skeptical of the paranormal story. Boarding at the home of Baltus and his wife, Lady Van Tassel, he is taken with Baltus' spiritual daughter, Katrina. When a fourth victim, Van Garrett servant Jonathan Masbath, is killed, Ichabod takes the victim's son, Young Masbath, under his wing. Ichabod and Masbath exhume the victims on a tip from Philipse, learning that the widow died pregnant; Ichabod witnesses the Horseman killing Philipse shortly after. He, Young Masbath and Katrina venture into the Western Woods, where a crone reveals the location of the Horseman's grave at the \"Tree of the Dead.\" He digs up the Horseman's grave and discovers the skull has been taken, deducing that it has been stolen by someone who now controls him and that the tree is his portal into the living world. That night, the Horseman kills village midwife Beth Killian and her family, as well as Katrina's suitor Brom when he attempts to intervene; Ichabod hypothesizes that the Horseman is attacking select targets linked by a conspiracy. He and Masbath visit Hardenbrook, who reveals that Van Garrett had secretly married Winship, writing a new will that left his estate to her and her unborn child. Ichabod deduces that all the victims (except Brom) are either beneficiaries or witnesses to this new will, and that the Horseman's master is the person who would have otherwise inherited the estate: Baltus, a Van Garrett relative. Upon discovering the accusation, Katrina burns the evidence. Hardenbrook commits suicide, and Steenwyck convenes a town meeting to discredit Ichabod, but Baltus bursts into the assembly at the church, announcing that the Horseman has killed his wife. The Horseman attacks the church, but is unable to enter. In the chaos, the remaining elders turn on and attack each other: Steenwyck and Lancaster are killed, and the Horseman harpoons Baltus through a window, dragging him out of the church and acquiring his head. Initially concluding that Katrina controls the Horseman, Ichabod discovers that her diagram, which he believed summoned the Horseman, is really one of protection, and additionally finds a post-mortem wound on \"Lady Van Tassel's\" body. Lady Van Tassel, alive and well, then reveals herself to Katrina, and explains her true heritage from an impoverished family evicted years ago by Van Garrett when he favored Baltus and his family instead. She swore revenge against Van Garrett and all who had wronged her, pledging herself to Satan if he would raise the Horseman to avenge her, and also to claim the Van Garrett and Van Tassel estates uncontested. Manipulating her way into the Van Tassel household, she used fear, blackmail, and lust to draw the other elders into her plot. Having eliminated all other heirs and witnesses — and having killed her sister, the crone, for aiding Ichabod — she summons the Horseman to finish Katrina. Ichabod and Masbath rush to the windmill as the Horseman arrives. After an escape that destroys the windmill and the subsequent chase to the Tree of the Dead, Ichabod retrieves the Horseman's skull from Lady Van Tassel and returns it to him, breaking the curse, and setting the Horseman free from Lady Van Tassel's control. With his head restored, the Horseman spares Katrina and abducts Lady Van Tassel, giving her a bloody kiss and returning to Hell with her in tow. Ichabod returns to New York with Katrina and Young Masbath.",

    "title": "Maleficent",
    "plot": "Maleficent is a powerful fairy living in the Moors, a magical forest realm. As a child, she meets a human boy named Stefan, and they fall in love with each other. However, as they get older, they grow apart, with Stefan's love overshadowed by his ambition to be king, while Maleficent becomes protector of the Moors. When King Henry attempts to conquer the Moors, Maleficent mortally wounds him. On his deathbed, he declares whoever kills her will be king and marry his daughter Leila. Stefan visits Maleficent and drugs her. Unwilling to kill her, Stefan instead uses a bracelet made of iron, which is lethal to fairies, to burn off her wings and presents them as \"proof\" of her death. While distraught by her loss, Maleficent saves Diaval, a trapped raven, from a farmer by turning him into a human. Diaval offers his service and tells her of Stefan's coronation. Infuriated over the betrayal, Maleficent grows cruel and bitter, ruling the Moors with an iron fist. Years later, Diaval informs Maleficent about the christening of Stefan's newborn daughter, Aurora. Maleficent arrives uninvited while three pixies, Knotgrass, Flittle, and Thistlewit, are bestowing magic gifts, and places a curse on Aurora: before the sun sets on Aurora's 16th birthday, Aurora will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and fall into a death-like sleep. Maleficent mocks Stefan's plea for mercy, but states Aurora's curse can be broken by true love's kiss, which she and Stefan both believe is nonexistent. Stefan orders the pixies to hide and protect Aurora in a forest cottage until after her 16th birthday. He also destroys every spinning wheel in the kingdom, hiding their remnants in the castle dungeon; he then sends his army after Maleficent, but she surrounds the Moors with a wall of thorns. Over the years, Stefan begins mass-manufacturing iron weapons nonstop and grows obsessed with killing Maleficent to the point of insanity, even refusing to see his wife on her deathbed. Maleficent and Diaval watch Aurora grow from afar, and secretly begin taking over care of her from the incompetent pixies. After several face-to-face encounters with Maleficent, whom she regards as her \"fairy godmother\", Aurora bonds with her and regularly visits the Moors. Realizing she does not have the heart to hurt Aurora, Maleficent privately and unsuccessfully attempts undoing Aurora's curse, forgetting she made \"no power on earth\" able to do so. Meanwhile, Aurora meets Philip, a prince from the neighboring kingdom, and both take a liking to each other. Aurora gains Maleficent's permission to live in the Moors before her 16th birthday. The next day, however, the pixies are forced to reveal Aurora's lineage and curse when she informs them. Heartbroken, Aurora confronts Maleficent and rides to her father's castle, where Stefan locks her up, angered that the pixies did not do their job. As the sun sets, the curse's power calls to Aurora and hypnotically draws Aurora to the dungeon, where Aurora pricks her finger on a spindle of a rebuilt magic spinning wheel and falls into a death-like sleep. Hoping to save her, Maleficent and Diaval abduct Philip and infiltrate the castle. Despite the pixies urging him, Philip's kiss is not enough. Afterward, Maleficent tearfully kisses Aurora, awakening her with true maternal love. As Maleficent, Aurora, and Diaval attempt to leave, Stefan and his guards ambush them. Maleficent transforms Diaval into a dragon, but both are subdued. Aurora finds and releases Maleficent's caged wings, which reattach themselves to Maleficent, allowing her to fight back. Maleficent drags Stefan to the top of a tower; unwilling to kill him, she announces the fight is over and leaves, but Stefan tackles her from behind, dragging them both off; she saves herself with her wings, while he loses hold and falls to his death. With Stefan gone, Maleficent brings down the thorn wall, returns the Moors to their former glory and crowns Aurora their new ruler, uniting the two kingdoms. Aurora also starts a relationship with Philip.",

    "plot": "Media mogul Bill Parrish is contemplating a merger with another media giant. Meanwhile, his eldest daughter Allison is planning an elaborate 65th birthday party for him. His younger daughter Susan, a resident in internal medicine, has a relationship with Drew, a member of Bill's board. As Bill contemplates Susan's planned marriage to Drew and seeing she is not deeply in love, he suggests she wait to be swept off her feet. After Bill's company helicopter lands at his office, he hears a voice that he tries to ignore. Arriving in his office, Bill has pains in his chest and hears the voice again, saying \"the answer to your question is yes\". While studying in a coffee shop near her hospital, Susan meets a young man and immediately forms a connection. She departs without getting his name. Unbeknownst to her, directly afterward, he is struck fatally by multiple cars. That evening, Bill hears the voice again, which summons him to a room. Materializing, the voice identifies itself as \"Death\" and now inhabits the body of the young man Susan met at the coffee shop. Death explains that Bill's impassioned speech to his daughter piqued his interest. Given Bill's \"competence, experience, and wisdom\", Death says that for as long as Bill is his guide on Earth, he can postpone taking him. They both return to the dinner table and, under pressure to make an introduction, Bill spontaneously names the young man \"Joe Black\". Joe does not seem to know how to drink, eat, or use eating utensils and is fascinated by the small things everyone else takes for granted. Drew secretly conspires to sell Parrish Communications, despite Bill's strong objections. Capitalizing on Bill's strange behavior and reliance on Joe, he convinces the board of directors to vote Bill out as chairman and to approve the merger. Intrigued by Joe's naivete, Susan realizes he is different from the young man she met in the coffee shop. She falls in love with him and he with her. Later, Bill sees them kissing and angrily confronts Joe about his relationship with Susan. He then expresses his disapproval of the pairing to Susan who says she loves him and he suggests to her that Joe will not be around much longer. At Susan's hospital, Joe interacts with a terminally ill woman, who wishes to die to escape her constant physical pain. She senses that Joe is part of her impending death. When Joe mentions that he loves Susan (whose care she is under), they discuss the meaning of life and she tells him the danger of meshing two worlds. When Joe asks if she is ready to go, she nods her head and dies. As Bill's birthday arrives, Joe declares his intention to take Susan with him. Bill pleads with him to recognize the meaning of true love and to not steal Susan's life. At the party, knowing his death is imminent, Bill says goodbye to his daughters. Susan tells Joe she has loved him since the day in the coffee shop, reveals he is not the man and it is heavily implied she understands what he is. They give a tearful goodbye as he tells her he loves her and thanks her for loving him. Quince apologizes to Bill for unwittingly undermining his position with the board, and Bill forgives him. He orders Quince to bring Drew to the party. Joe helps Bill regain control of his company, exposing Drew's underhanded business dealings to the board by claiming to be an agent of the Internal Revenue Service and threatening to put Drew in jail. Susan and Bill later say goodbye as he makes inferences to passing and to live with no regrets. They share their final dance as fireworks begin, and on a hilltop above the party, Joe waits with tears in his eyes watching the fireworks. Bill heads up to him, and they share their thanks. Bill to Joe for showing Susan how she should be loved and Joe to Bill for being a good man. Susan watches Joe and her father cross a nearby bridge as Bill asks if he should be afraid and Joe responds \"Not a man like you\" and they descend out of sight on the other side. Joe reappears alone, again the young man from the coffee shop, uninjured and not comprehending where he is or where he was while he was gone. Susan at first thinks it's Joe, but then realizes he's the young man she first met as they recall what they said as they parted the coffee shop and she expresses a wish he could have met her father. She descends hand-in-hand with him toward the party with fireworks bursting in the background.",

    "plot": "Thirteen years after Will Turner first leaves Elizabeth Swann aboard the Flying Dutchman, and three years after the One Day, he is visited by his twelve-year-old son, Henry. Will is still bound to the Dutchman and can step on land once a decade, but Henry says that he can be freed from his curse by the Trident of Poseidon. Although his father tells him to accept his fate, Henry intends to recruit pirate Captain Jack Sparrow to help find the Trident. Nine years later, Henry is aboard a British Navy ship, which sails into the supernatural Devil's Triangle and comes across the ghost ship Silent Mary. The sailors in Henry's ship are slaughtered by ghosts led by Spanish Navy pirate hunter, Captain Armando Salazar, who leaves Henry as the sole survivor so that he can deliver a message of revenge to Jack Sparrow. Jack, as a young pirate, had tricked Salazar into entering the Triangle, causing his death but also inadvertently cursing his ship and crew as the undead. On Saint Martin, young astronomer Carina Smyth is sentenced to death for Witchcraft but escapes and crosses paths with Jack, who has been suffering from a spell of bad luck, as his pirate crew botches a bank robbery. Jack later trades his compass for a drink, an act that destroys the Devil's Triangle and frees Salazar's ghostly crew to seek revenge. Carina learns Henry is looking for the Trident's location and offers to help him using her unknown father's diary. Upon their arrests, Carina and Jack stall the execution process, but they escape with the help of Henry and Jack's crew. They all set sail on the Dying Gull, where Carina deciphers the clues in her diary, discovering that the stars will lead to an island where the Trident is hidden. Meanwhile, Captain Hector Barbossa is informed that Salazar has attacked three pirate ships of Barbossa's fleet. Shansa, a sea witch, tells Barbossa that the Trident could lead him to a \"treasure\" and gives him Jack's compass. Barbossa makes a deal with Salazar by offering to help find Jack. Salazar pursues the Dying Gull, forcing Jack, Henry, and Carina to flee to an island, discovering that Salazar's crew cannot go on land. Barbossa allies himself with Jack, releasing the miniaturized Black Pearl that was trapped in a bottle, and taking command of the restored Pearl once more as they continue their journey to the Trident's island. During the voyage, Jack and Barbossa realize Carina is the latter's long-lost daughter. The Pearl approaches the Trident's island and evades a British Navy warship until it is destroyed by the Silent Mary before the Pearl runs aground on the island. Jack, Barbossa, and Carina use the island's magic to part the ocean which opens a path to the Trident on the ocean floor. Salazar captures Henry and possesses him to walk on the ocean floor and seize the Trident. Once he does so, Henry is given his body back, and Jack distracts Salazar, allowing Henry to destroy the Trident, breaking all curses upon the sea and restoring Salazar's crew to life. However, the Trident's destruction causes the divided sea to close in on them. The Pearl lowers its anchor to lift the group to safety, but Salazar pursues them. Carina realizes that Barbossa is her father when she spots a tattoo on Barbossa's arm, the Trident's star formation, identical to the diary's cover. Barbossa sacrifices himself to kill Salazar, allowing the others to escape. Shortly afterwards, Carina names herself \"Barbossa\" before Henry and Carina go to Port Royal, Jamaica. Henry and Carina kiss before Henry reunites with Will, now free from the Dutchman, on land. Will then hugs and kisses Elizabeth Swann immediately afterwards. After watching the reunion from aboard the Black Pearl, Sparrow adopts Barbossa's monkey \"Jack\" before sailing away into the horizon. In a post-credits scene, Will and Elizabeth are asleep in a bedroom when the shadow of Davy Jones enters. When the figure moves closer with his claw, Will wakes up to see nobody in the room. Assuming it was a nightmare, Will turns toward his wife and goes back to sleep, unaware of the barnacles lying on the floor next to the bed.",

    "plot": "In Kathmandu, the sorcerer Kaecilius and his zealots enter the secret compound Kamar-Taj and behead its librarian. They steal several pages from a book belonging to the Ancient One, a long-lived sorcerer who has taught every student at Kamar-Taj, including Kaecilius, in the mystic arts. The Ancient One pursues the traitors, but Kaecilius and his followers escape. In New York City, Dr. Stephen Strange, a wealthy, acclaimed, and arrogant neurosurgeon, severely injures his hands in a car crash while en route to a speaking conference, leaving him permanently unable to operate. Fellow surgeon Christine Palmer tries to help him move on, but Strange vainly pursues experimental surgeries to heal his hands. Strange learns about Jonathan Pangborn, a paraplegic who mysteriously regained use of his legs. Pangborn directs Strange to Kamar-Taj, where he is taken in by Mordo, a sorcerer under the Ancient One. The Ancient One demonstrates her power to Strange, revealing the astral plane and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension. She reluctantly agrees to train Strange, whose arrogance and ambition remind her of Kaecilius. Strange studies under the Ancient One and Mordo, and from ancient texts in the library that are now guarded by Master Wong. Strange learns that Earth is protected from threats from other dimensions by a shield generated from three Sanctums in New York City, London, and Hong Kong, which are all directly accessible from Kamar-Taj. The sorcerers' task is to protect the Sanctums, though Pangborn instead chose to channel mystical energy only to heal his paralysis. Strange progresses quickly, and secretly reads the book from which Kaecilius stole pages, learning to bend time with the Eye of Agamotto. Mordo and Wong warn Strange against breaking the laws of nature, drawing a comparison to Kaecilius' desire for eternal life. Kaecilius uses the stolen pages to contact Dormammu of the Dark Dimension, where time is non-existent, and destroys the London Sanctum to weaken Earth's protection. The zealots then attack the New York Sanctum, killing its guardian, but Strange holds them off with the help of the Cloak of Levitation, only to be critically injured during a skirmish. He teleports himself back to the hospital where Palmer saves him. Upon returning to the Sanctum, Strange reveals to Mordo that the Ancient One has been drawing power from the Dark Dimension to sustain long life, and Mordo becomes disillusioned with her. After a fight in the Mirror Dimension of New York, Kaecilius mortally wounds the Ancient One and escapes to Hong Kong. Before dying, she tells Strange that he and Mordo will have to work together to defeat Kaecilius, balancing Mordo's steadfast nature against Strange's willingness to bend the rules. Strange and Mordo arrive in Hong Kong to find Wong dead, the Sanctum destroyed, and the Dark Dimension engulfing Earth. Strange uses the Eye to reverse time and save Wong, then enters the Dark Dimension and creates an endless time loop around himself and Dormammu. After repeatedly killing Strange to no avail, Dormammu finally accepts his bargain, leaving Earth permanently and taking Kaecilius and the zealots with him in exchange for Strange breaking the loop. Disgusted by Strange and the Ancient One defying nature's laws, Mordo renounces his sorcerer career and departs. Strange returns the Eye, which is revealed to hold an Infinity Stone, back to Kamar-Taj and takes up residence in the New York Sanctum to continue his studies with Wong. In a mid-credits scene, Strange decides to help Thor, who has brought his brother Loki to Earth to search for their father, Odin. In a post-credits scene, Mordo confronts Pangborn and steals the mystical energy he uses, telling him that Earth has \"too many sorcerers\".",

    "plot": "12-year-old Bea moves into her grandmother Margaret's apartment in New York while her father awaits heart surgery in the same hospital where her mother died years earlier. Bea insists that she is not a child but that night looks through a closet of her childhood things. She later sees an unfamiliar creature and follows it back to her grandmother's building. The next night, she sees it again, accompanied by a mysterious man, and follows them to a nearby house where the man, Calvin, retrieves a large, furry, purple creature named Blue. Bea then meets the other creature, a butterfly-like being named Blossom, and faints. Bea awakens in Cal's apartment, where she learns that he has been working with imaginary friends (IFs) to place them with new children as their original children have grown up and forgotten them. Initially reluctant, she decides to help Cal. The next day, Cal takes Bea to Memory Lane Retirement Home, a retirement community for forgotten IFs housed underneath a swing ride at Coney Island. An elderly teddy bear IF named Lewis inspires her to use her imagination to redesign the facility. Bea tries to match one of the IFs with Benjamin, a young patient at the hospital, but he is unable to see any of them. Lewis suggests that IFs might not need new children, but rather to reunite with their old ones. Margaret tells Bea about her childhood dream of becoming a dancer. Bea recognizes Blossom in one of Margaret's childhood photographs. Blossom acknowledges being Margaret's IF, but Margaret can no longer see her. Bea tries to stir Margaret's memory by playing a phonograph record, which inspires Margaret to dance. While Margaret relives her childhood dream, Blossom glows and grows butterfly wings. Following a tip, Bea, Cal, and Blue find Blue's original child Jeremy, now a man anxiously trying to make a business deal. With Bea's help, Jeremy is reminded of his childhood, causing Blue to glow. Blue then touches Jeremy, who had frozen outside his business meeting, and the glow spreads to Jeremy as Blue tells him \"you're okay\". Jeremy then begins his business presentation with newfound confidence. Blue's achievement is celebrated at Memory Lane, where Bea says that she and Cal make a good team. Bea returns to Margaret's apartment to find Margaret worried about Bea's father, who has undergone his surgery. Comforted by Cal, Bea confides that she does not want to say goodbye to her dad, so he suggests she tell him a story instead. At the hospital, Bea tells her unresponsive father a story about how she was pushing herself to act like a grown-up when she is just a child who still needs her father. He awakens, much to her relief. When Bea exits his hospital room, all of the IFs who had accompanied her to the hospital have vanished. Returning to her grandmother's building, Bea tries to thank Cal only to discover that the door to his apartment opens into an old storage room. After her dad is released from the hospital, he and Bea pack to return home. During this, Bea realizes from an old picture she painted that Cal is her own IF, whom she had forgotten after her mother's death. Bea rushes to Cal's room and thanks him for helping, telling him that she will always need him. This allows her to see Cal and the IFs again, and they reunite one last time, a glow spreading between them. Sometime later, Cal continues reuniting the IFs with their grown-up humans, and Benjamin meets his IF, a cartoonish, bespectacled physician dragon with similar injuries.",

    "title": "Fountain of Youth",
    "plot": "Disgraced archaeologist Luke Purdue steals a painting from criminals in Thailand and foils the mysterious Esme and her henchmen, who attempt to seize the painting themselves. In London, Luke surprises his sister Charlotte, a museum curator who is divorcing her unfaithful husband Harold. Stealing another painting from the museum, Luke baits Charlotte into fleeing with him and his partners Murphy and Deb, revealing that he has continued their late father's legacy of treasure-hunting. Questioned by Interpol Inspector Jamal Abbas, Charlotte is fired and confronts Luke at his hideout, where she is introduced to Owen Carver, a wealthy corporate raider with terminal cancer who is financing Luke and his team's search for the fabled Fountain of Youth. Owen entices Charlotte to join the team with the promise of giving her a powerful lawyer to gain custody of her son. Their father's notes reveal that a secret society known as the \"Protectors of the Path\" has concealed the Fountain for centuries, but a faction who disagreed with the Path's mission hid clues in six historic paintings Luke has stolen, including Rembrandt's Head of Christ from the museum. Charlotte admits that the Head of Christ is a duplicate, and reluctantly joins her brother's quest. The real painting was lost in the sinking of the Lusitania, and the team raises the first-class section of the ship to the surface. Recovering the painting from Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt's safe, Luke and Charlotte are held at gunpoint by Esme and her fellow Protectors, but escape the sinking wreckage with the painting. The team returns to London and the paintings' clues point them to the Wicked Bible, but their hideout is raided by Abbas before they are all ambushed by the Thai gangsters. Provoking a shootout, Luke escapes with his team. Harold accepts a job overseas, leading Charlotte to bring their son Thomas with the team to Vienna. Examining the Wicked Bible at the Austrian National Library, Luke is again ambushed by Esme, who warns that the Fountain hides a terrible power he does not understand. He and his team steal the Bible, but Charlotte refuses to further endanger her son and storms off. Thomas convinces her to return, having deduced that the code hidden in the Bible is musical notes, which the team identify as an ancient song honoring the Seven Wonders and realize the Fountain is located in a newly discovered secret passage beneath the Great Pyramid of Giza thanks to muography. It’s a subtle nod to the real ScanPyramids mission. Esme meets with the Elder of the Protectors of the Path, who reminds her that she must do whatever is necessary to keep the Fountain from being unearthed, for humanity's own protection. In Cairo, Carver secures the pyramid with his heavily armed mercenaries, forcing Luke, Charlotte, and Thomas to unlock the secret passage. Abbas arrives with a convoy of Interpol agents, only to be outgunned by the mercenaries, and Deb is wounded as she and Murphy try to intervene. Esme and her fellow Protectors overpower Carver's men, and she and Abbas join forces, pursuing the others into the passage. In the depths of the pyramid, Luke and the others discover the Fountain. Charlotte realizes Carver is not sick and simply wants to hoard the Fountain's power for himself, but Carver shoots Luke in the arm, demanding he drink from the Fountain to test its effects. A drop of Luke's blood causes the mystical waters to tempt him with a vision of eternal life, at the cost of Charlotte and Thomas' own lives, and he realizes the curse of the Fountain: whatever energy he is granted will be transferred from those he loves most. Luke refuses to drink, and his wounds are instantly healed. Abbas and Esme reach the chamber just as Carver drinks the water but, as he cares only about himself, he is drained of his own life force. Esme uses a key from the Elder to seal the chamber, trapping the rapidly aging Carver inside as the others escape. Charlotte convinces Abbas to blame Carver for their crimes, and Esme shares a kiss with Luke, warning that their paths will cross again if he continues to search for forbidden treasures. Luke reunites with his team, and Charlotte and Thomas suggest their next adventure.",

    "plot": "Gorr and his daughter, Love, the last of their race, struggle in a barren desert. Despite their prayers to their god, Rapu, Love dies. The god-killing Necrosword calls to Gorr, leading him to Rapu's lush realm. After Rapu cruelly mocks and dismisses Gorr's plight, he renounces the god, causing Rapu to start strangling him. The Necrosword offers itself to Gorr, who kills Rapu with it and vows to kill all gods. Gorr is granted the ability to manipulate shadows and produce monsters but is cursed with impending death and corruption under the sword's influence. Thor has joined the Guardians of the Galaxy after the Avengers' battle against Thanos. He learns of a distress signal from Sif, so he parts ways with the team. He finds an injured Sif, who warns that Gorr's next target is New Asgard. Meanwhile, Dr. Jane Foster, Thor's ex-girlfriend, has been diagnosed with stage four terminal cancer. With medical treatment proving ineffective, she travels to New Asgard hoping that Thor's hammer Mjolnir, which was previously fractured by Hela, might heal her. Due to an enchantment Thor unknowingly placed on it years earlier to protect Foster, Mjolnir reforges and bonds itself to her. Thor arrives in New Asgard just as Gorr's attack begins. Thor is surprised to find Foster wielding Mjolnir, but teams up with her, Valkyrie, and Korg to fight Gorr. The group thwarts Gorr, but he escapes, kidnapping numerous Asgardian children and imprisoning them in the Shadow Realm. The group travels to Omnipotence City to warn the other gods and ask for their help in creating an army. The leader of the gods, Zeus, is unwilling to help, thinking they can remain safe and hidden from Gorr in the city; he also believes that Gorr will not be able to achieve his stated goal of visiting the realm of Eternity, where he will be granted one wish, presumably to destroy all gods. As a security precaution, Zeus orders the group's capture to prevent them from exposing the city's location to Gorr. When Zeus injures Korg, Thor impales Zeus with his own thunderbolt, which Valkyrie steals before they escape to confront Gorr in the Shadow Realm. On the way, Thor learns of Foster's cancer diagnosis. The group arrives at the Shadow Realm but are unable to locate the children. Foster sees ancient drawings that depict Thor's battle-axe Stormbreaker as a way to summon the Bifrost to enter Eternity, and deduces the trap laid out by Gorr. She throws away Stormbreaker to prevent Gorr from accessing it. However, Gorr overpowers the group and threatens to kill Foster, forcing Thor to summon it back. Gorr successfully steals Stormbreaker and injures Valkyrie before a weakened Foster collapses. Upon traveling back to New Asgard, Thor discovers that Foster's Thor form is not allowing her body to naturally fight the cancer. Due to this, Thor travels to Eternity's altar alone and using Zeus's thunderbolt, imbues the children with his power to fight Gorr's monsters while he battles Gorr. When Foster senses that Gorr is about to kill Thor, she joins the battle with Mjolnir to save him. They destroy the Necrosword, freeing Gorr from its influence, but the three are brought into Eternity's realm. With Gorr poised to make his wish, Thor implores Gorr to revive his daughter instead of destroying the gods. Thor then leaves Gorr to make his decision and attends to Foster, who succumbs to her illness and dies in his arms. Moved by their display, Gorr wishes for Eternity to revive Love, which it grants. As Gorr dies from the curse, he requests Thor to take care of Love. In the aftermath, the children return to New Asgard, where Valkyrie and Sif commence their training, and a monument is erected in Foster's memory. Thor adopts Love, who accompanies him in his heroics, with Thor wielding Mjolnir and Love wielding Stormbreaker. In a mid-credits scene, back in Omnipotence City, a recuperating Zeus sends his son Hercules to kill Thor as revenge. In a post-credits scene, Foster arrives at the gates of Valhalla, where Heimdall welcomes her.",

    "title": "The Wizard of Oz",
    "plot": "In rural Kansas, Dorothy Gale lives on a farm owned by her Uncle Henry and Aunt Em and wishes she could be somewhere else. Her neighbor, Almira Gulch, who was bitten by Dorothy's dog, Toto, obtains a sheriff's order authorizing her to seize him, but Toto escapes and returns to Dorothy, who runs away to protect him. Professor Marvel, a charlatan fortune teller, convinces her that Aunt Em is heartbroken, which prompts Dorothy to return home. She returns just as a tornado approaches the farm. Unable to get into the locked storm cellar, she takes cover in the farmhouse and is knocked unconscious by the window. She seemingly awakens to find the house moving through the air, with her and Toto still inside it and various figures float by with Gulch turning into a witch. The house comes down in an unknown land, and Dorothy is greeted by a good witch named Glinda, who floats down in a bubble and explains that she has landed in Munchkinland in the Land of Oz, and that the Munchkins are celebrating because the house landed on the Wicked Witch of the East, killing her. Her sister, the Wicked Witch of the West, suddenly appears, but before she can seize her deceased sister's ruby slippers, Glinda magically transports them onto Dorothy's feet and tells her to keep them on. Because the Wicked Witch has no power in Munchkinland, she leaves, but swears vengeance upon Dorothy and Toto. Glinda tells Dorothy to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City, the home of the Wizard of Oz, as he might know how to help her return home, before she floats away in her bubble. Along the way, Dorothy meets the Scarecrow, who wants a brain; the Tin Man, who wants a heart; and the Cowardly Lion, who wants courage. They reach the Emerald City, despite the efforts of the Wicked Witch. They are initially denied an audience with the Wizard by his guard, who relents due to Dorothy's grief, and they are led into the Wizard's chambers. He appears as a giant ghostly head and tells them he will grant their wishes if they bring him the Wicked Witch's broom. During their quest, Dorothy and Toto are captured by flying monkeys and taken to the Wicked Witch's castle, but the ruby slippers protect her, and Toto manages to escape, leading the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion to the castle. They free Dorothy, but are pursued and finally cornered by the Witch and her guards, the Winkies. She taunts them and sets fire to the Scarecrow's arm. When Dorothy throws a bucket of water onto him, she inadvertently splashes the Witch, causing her to melt away. The Winkies gratefully give Dorothy the Witch's broom, and the group returns to the Wizard, but he tells them to come back the next day. When Toto pulls back a curtain, the \"Wizard\" is revealed to be an ordinary man operating machinery that projects a ghostly image of his face. They confront him, who insists he is a good man at heart, but confesses to being a humbug. He then \"grants\" Dorothy's friends' wishes by giving them tokens to confirm that they had the qualities they sought. The Wizard reveals that he, like Dorothy, is from Kansas and accidentally arrived in Oz in a hot air balloon. When he offers to take her back to Kansas with him aboard it, she accepts, but Toto jumps out of her arms and she goes after him, and the balloon accidentally lifts off with just the Wizard aboard. Glinda then floats down in her bubble and reappears before she walks over and tells Dorothy she always had the power to return to Kansas using the ruby slippers but had to find that out for herself. After sharing a tearful farewell with her friends, she heeds Glinda's instructions by clicking her heels three times and repeating, \"There's no place like home.\" Dorothy awakens in her own bed in Kansas. She recounts her adventures, but Aunt Em says that she just had a bad dream. She tells Professor Marvel and the farmhands that they were in Oz also, and they smile, humoring her. As she hugs Toto, she gratefully exclaims, \"Oh, Auntie Em, there's no place like home!\"",

    "title": "Ghost Rider",
    "plot": "The demon Mephistopheles sends his bounty hunter, the Ghost Rider, to retrieve the contract of San Venganza for control of a thousand dark souls. Seeing that the agreement would give Mephistopheles the power to bring hell on Earth, the Rider refuses and escapes with it. In 1986, Mephistopheles reaches out to 17-year-old Johnny Blaze, offering to cure his father's cancer in exchange for Johnny's soul. The next morning, Johnny awakens to discover the cancer cured, but his father dies later from burns sustained in a stunt accident. Johnny accuses Mephistopheles of causing his father's death, but Mephistopheles considers his side of the contract fulfilled and promises to see Johnny again as Mephistopheles takes Johnny's soul. Instead of running away with his girlfriend, Roxanne Simpson as planned, Johnny just rode off. In the present, Johnny has become a famous motorcycle stuntman. He survives a near-fatal crash after leaping over a field of semi trucks. Later he runs into his ex-girlfriend, Roxanne, now a news reporter, just before he lands a motorcycle stunt where he clears a football field over blackhawk helicopters while their blade rotors were spinning. He convinces her to attend a dinner date. Meanwhile, Mephistopheles' son Blackheart comes to Earth and seeks aid from the Hidden (three fallen angels bonded with the elements of air, earth, and water) to find the lost contract of San Venganza. Mephistopheles makes Johnny the new Ghost Rider and offers to return his soul if he defeats Blackheart. Johnny transforms into the Ghost Rider, his flesh burning off his skeleton, and kills the earth angel Gressil. He then uses the Penance Stare, a power that causes mortals to feel all the pain they have caused others, on a street thug, searing his soul. The next day, he meets a man called the Caretaker, who knows about the Ghost Rider's history. He assures Johnny that what happened was real and will happen again, especially at night, when he is near an evil soul. Johnny leaves to find Roxanne, who is reporting the previous night's events on the news. At home, Johnny tries to control his firepower. Roxanne, upset about being stood up, comes to visit before leaving town, and Johnny reveals himself as the Devil's bounty hunter. Unconvinced, she walks away in disbelief. Johnny winds up in prison for murders Blackheart committed due to his license plate being discovered at a crime scene, in which Johnny kills several convicts and the air angel Abigor and escapes from the police. He returns to the Caretaker, who tells him of his predecessor Carter Slade, a Texas Ranger who hid the contract of San Venganza. At home, Johnny discovers that Blackheart has killed his friend Mack and taken Roxanne hostage, intending to kill her if Johnny does not deliver the contract. Johnny tries to use the Penance Stare on Blackheart, but it proves ineffective as Blackheart has no soul. Blackheart then orders Johnny to retrieve the contract and bring it to him in San Venganza. Johnny returns to the Caretaker, demanding the contract to save Roxanne. The Caretaker reveals that it is hidden inside a spade, telling Johnny that he is stronger than his predecessors because he sold his soul for love rather than greed, before giving it to him. The Caretaker then transforms with Blaze, revealing that he is actually Carter Slade. Slade then leads Johnny to San Venganza and gives him a lever-action shotgun before bidding him farewell and having finally shaken off the curse, fading into dust as he rides away. After killing the water angel Wallow, Johnny gives Blackheart the contract. He transforms into the Ghost Rider to subdue Blackheart, but is rendered powerless at sunrise. Using the contract to absorb the thousand souls, Blackheart, now calling himself Legion, attempts to finish Johnny off, but is distracted when Roxanne uses Johnny's shotgun to separate them. Johnny shoots Blackheart with the gun, holding it in the shadows to allow him to enhance it with his power. Keeping his own body in shadow, he transforms again and uses his Penance Stare to render Blackheart catatonic by burning all the corrupt souls within him. Mephistopheles appears and declares the contract is complete, offering to take back the curse of the Ghost Rider. Determined not to let anyone else make another deal, Johnny declines, declaring that he will use his power against the demon and against all harm that comes to the innocent. Infuriated, Mephistopheles vows to make Johnny pay and disappears with Blackheart's body. Roxanne tells Johnny that he has his second chance and kisses him. Johnny rides away on his motorcycle, preparing for his new life as the Ghost Rider.",

After defeating Malekith's forces on their homeworld of Svartalfheim, Bor sends the Aether to a hidden world that no one can reach. However, Malekith escapes with his lieutenant Algrim and a handful of Dark Elves before going into suspended animation. In present-day Asgard, Odin imprisons Loki for his various crimes on Earth. Meanwhile, Thor and his companions repel marauders on Vanaheim to pacify the Nine Realms following the reconstruction of the Bifröst—the \"Rainbow Bridge\" between realms which was destroyed two years earlier. The Asgardians learn that the Convergence, a rare alignment of the Nine Realms, is imminent; as the event approaches, portals linking the worlds appear at random. In London, astrophysicist Dr. Jane Foster travels to an abandoned factory where such portals have appeared. Foster is teleported to the hidden world where the Aether is stored and it enters her body. Thor finds Foster and takes her to Asgard, where Odin warns that the Aether will not only kill her but herald a catastrophic prophecy. Malekith, awakened by the Aether's release, attacks Asgard searching for Foster. Thor's mother Frigga is killed trying to protect her. Thor recruits Loki, who knows of a secret portal to Svartalfheim where they plan to confront Malekith, to avenge Frigga. On Svartalfheim, Loki uses an illusion to trick Malekith into drawing the Aether out of Foster, but Thor's attempt to destroy it fails. Malekith merges with the Aether and leaves as Loki seemingly dies while killing Algrim. Thor and Foster reunite in London with Foster's mentor, Dr. Erik Selvig. They learn that Malekith plans to plunge the entire universe into darkness by unleashing the Aether at the center of the Convergence in Greenwich. Thor battles Malekith across multiple worlds while Jane's group use their scientific equipment to transport Malekith to Svartalfheim, where he is crushed by his own ship. Thor returns to Asgard, where he declines Odin's offer to take the throne. After he leaves, Loki is revealed to be alive and impersonating Odin. In a mid-credits scene, Volstagg and Sif visit the Collector and entrust the Aether to his care; with the Tesseract already in Asgard, they fear that having two Infinity Stones so close together would be dangerous. As they leave, the Collector states his desire to acquire the other five Stones. In a post-credits scene, Foster and Thor reunite on Earth.",

    "plot": "In 1985, 8-year-old John Bennett is a friendless only child living in Norwood, Massachusetts. On Christmas Day, he wishes for his new gift, a jumbo teddy bear named Ted, to come to life and become his friend. The wish coincides with a shooting star and comes true; word spreads, and Ted briefly becomes a celebrity. In 2012, the now 35 y.o. John and Ted are still living together in an apartment in Boston with John's girlfriend Lori Collins, and are staunch companions enjoying a hedonistic life. As the couple's fourth anniversary approaches, Lori hopes to marry John, but feels he cannot move forward in life with Ted around. He is hesitant about making Ted leave, but is persuaded to act when they find Ted at home with a group of prostitutes, including one who defecated on the floor, while they were out for their anniversary dinner. John finds Ted his own apartment and a job at a grocery store, where he begins dating his co-worker, Tami-Lynn. Lori learns that John has been skipping work, using her as an excuse, to spend most of his time with Ted. John and Lori are invited to a party put on by Lori's womanizing manager Rex, but Ted lures John away to a party at his apartment with the offer to meet Sam J. Jones, the star of their favorite film, Flash Gordon. Intending to stay only for a few minutes, John gets caught up in the occasion. Lori finds John there and kicks him out of their apartment, breaking up with him. Devastated and furious, he blames Ted for ruining his life and ends their friendship. Ted then goes to John's hotel room to inform him that Lori and Rex are attending a Norah Jones concert on a date together. Their conversation becomes an argument and then a violent brawl, but they reconcile. To repair John's relationship with Lori, Ted arranges for Norah Jones, an old lover of his, to help by having John express his love for Lori with a song during Norah's concert. John does an off-key rendition of \"All Time High\", the theme song of Octopussy, which he and Lori watched on their first date. He is booed off stage, though the attempt touches Lori. She returns to her apartment, where Ted confesses to his role in John's relapse and offers to leave them alone forever if she talks to John, to which Lori agrees. After Lori leaves, however, Ted is kidnapped by Donny, an obsessive stalker who has idolized him since he was a child. Donny plans to make Ted into his son Robert's new toy. Ted obtains a phone to contact John, but is recaptured. Realizing Ted is in danger, John and Lori locate Donny's residence and track him. They chase them to Fenway Park, where Donny rips Ted in half. Two police cars arrive, forcing Donny to flee the scene. John and Lori gather Ted's stuffing, and Ted relays his wish for John to be happy with Lori before the magic in Ted fades away, making him a normal teddy bear again. Unable to accept the death, John and Lori unsuccessfully attempt to repair Ted. Saddened about the incident, Lori makes a wish upon a shooting star. The following day, Ted is magically restored due to the wish and reunites with John and Lori. John finally proposes to her, and she accepts. Sometime later, John and Lori get married (with Sam Jones as the presiding minister). In the film's epilogue, the narrator says that Ted comfortably accepted having a life of his own, as he and Tami-Lynn continued their love affair; Sam Jones attempts to restart his film career and moves into a studio apartment with Brandon Routh; Rex gives up his pursuit of Lori, goes into a deep depression, and dies of Lou Gehrig's disease; Donny gets arrested by the Boston Police Department for kidnapping Ted, but the charges are dropped, due to the situation sounding ridiculous. Robert hires a personal trainer, loses a significant amount of weight, and goes on to become Taylor Lautner.",

    "plot": "In AD 895, King Aurvandill \"War-Raven\" returns to the island of Hrafnsey, reuniting with his wife, Queen Gudrún, and his heir, Prince Amleth. To prepare Amleth for his eventual accession to the throne, the father and son participate in a ceremony overseen by Aurvandill's jester, Heimir. Heimir tells Amleth that his destiny is fixed and cannot be escaped, and Amleth vows to avenge his father if Aurvandill is ever slain, rather than live his life in shame. The next morning, Amleth's bastard uncle Fjölnir stages a palace coup, beheads Aurvandill, sacks the hillfort and carries away Gudrún. Amleth narrowly escapes Fjölnir's assassins and flees by boat, swearing vengeance. Several years later, an adult Amleth is a type of berserker, known as an ulfhéðinn, within a band of Vikings. After attacking a village in Garðaríki, he encounters a Seeress in the temple of Svetovit; the Seeress orders Amleth to remember his oath of vengeance and tells him that his fate is intertwined with that of a Maiden-King. Soon after, he learns that \"Fjölnir the Brotherless\" has lost his throne to Harald of Norway and now lives as a sheep farmer in Iceland. Branding himself as a thrall, a slave, Amleth sneaks aboard a ship taking them to Iceland. He encounters an enslaved Slavic woman named Olga, who claims to be a sorceress. They are taken to Fjölnir's farm, where Amleth learns his mother married Fjölnir and bore him a son named Gunnar. One night, Amleth follows a vixen and encounters a he-witch, who facilitates a seance between Amleth and the skull of Heimir, whom Fjölnir has also murdered. Heimir tells Amleth about Draugr, a magical sword that can only be drawn at night or at the Gates of Hel. Amleth enters a barrow and obtains the blade from its owner, the undead Mound Dweller. He hides the sword upon his return to the farm. The next day, Amleth is selected to compete in a game of knattleikr against another farm. The game turns violent when the leader of the opposing team brutalizes the competition until only he and Amleth are left. Gunnar (looking up to Amleth, not knowing he is his half-brother), is almost killed in trying to draw away the opposing player; but Amleth saves him, furiously beating his opponent to death. As a reward, Fjölnir's adult son, Thórir, grants him overseer duties and allows him to choose a woman. During the evening celebrations, Amleth and Olga make love; they promise to overcome Fjölnir together. Over several nights Amleth kills prominent members of Fjölnir's estate in unnatural ways, arranging their impaled body parts into the shape of a horse in a gruesome display. This makes Fjölnir and the entire estate believe they are under attack from an evil spirit. Olga mixes the food supply with fly agaric, a potent hallucinogen. Christian slaves are believed by Thórir to be responsible. This allows Amleth to enter Fjölnir's house. Amleth reveals his identity to Gudrún, who replies that she was Aurvandill's slave and that Amleth was conceived by rape. Gudrún also reveals that she masterminded Fjölnir's coup because she wanted both Aurvandill and Amleth dead; she tries to seduce Amleth, who, after a moment, rejects her. Enraged, Amleth kills Thórir, and cuts out his heart. Gudrún reveals Amleth's true identity to Fjölnir and calls for Amleth's death. Fjölnir decides to kill Olga, but Amleth offers to trade Olga's life for Thórir's heart. Amleth allows himself to be captured, and is tortured for the location of Thórir's heart. Amleth is released from his restraints by a flock of ravens sent by Odin and Olga rescues him. Amleth decides to abandon his quest for revenge, and the two decide to escape by boat to his kinsmen in the Orkney Islands. Aboard the vessel Amleth has a vision, and realizes that Olga is pregnant with twins, one of whom will be the Maiden-King prophesied by the Seeress. Realizing that Olga and their children will never be safe while Fjölnir lives, Amleth, despite Olga's pleas, jumps overboard and swims ashore reasoning that he cannot escape his fate. Back at the farm, Amleth kills Fjölnir's remaining men and frees the slaves. While searching for Fjölnir, Amleth is attacked by Gudrún and Gunnar and kills them in self-defense after being wounded. Fjölnir, discovering his wife and son dead, coldly tells Amleth to meet him at the Gates of Hel: the crater of the volcano Hekla. Amleth and Fjölnir engage naked in a fierce Holmgang (duel) until Fjölnir is beheaded and Amleth is simultaneously stabbed. As he dies, Amleth has a vision of Olga embracing their two children, whom she tells him are safe, before urging him to let go. A valkyrie carries Amleth through the gates of Valhöll.",

    "plot": "Following the death of her father, neurotic and spoiled heiress Carrigan Crittenden discovers she has only been left Whipstaff Manor, located in Friendship, Maine, in the will while his vast wealth has gone to several charities. Carrigan and her lawyer and close friend Dibs find a map within the will's papers that tell of an alleged treasure hidden inside the manor, only to find that the property is haunted by a friendly ghost named Casper and his poltergeist uncles the Ghostly Trio. They unsuccessfully attempt to force the ghosts out by way of paranormal experts and a demolitions team. A lonely Casper watches a news report about paranormal therapist James Harvey and is instantly smitten with his teenage daughter, Kat, prompting Casper to inspire Carrigan in summoning James to Whipstaff. Kat dislikes her father's reputation and obsession with contacting the ghost of his late wife, Amelia. The Harveys move into Whipstaff, but Casper's attempt to befriend them fails when his uncles try to torment and scare them away, which eventually fails. The following morning, Casper gains the Harveys' trust when he serves them breakfast, and follows Kat to school, where she becomes popular when her class learns she is living in Whipstaff, and agrees to host their Halloween party there. Her classmate Amber plots with her friend, Vic, to humiliate Kat during the party, while James attempts therapy sessions with the Ghostly Trio, who reveal that they know Amelia; in exchange for convincing Carrigan to leave them alone, they promise to get James a meeting with his wife. Kat learns that Casper has no memory of his life, and restores his old playroom in the attic to remind him. Casper recognizes an old wooden sled his father bought him, and remembers playing outside until he caught a severe cold and died of pneumonia, becoming a ghost to keep his father company. A newspaper article reveals that Casper's father was declared legally insane after he built a machine, the Lazarus, which he claimed could bring the dead back to life. Casper and Kat venture to the basement and find the Lazarus. Carrigan and Dibs sneak inside and steal the formula that powers the machine, plotting to use it to grant themselves immortality. However, they attempt to kill each other to test the theory and retrieve the treasure that they think is in the basement's locked vault. This culminates in Carrigan attempting to run Dibs over with her Range Rover, but instead crashing into a cliff-side tree; upon exiting her car, Carrigan falls to her death and becomes a ghost. James becomes depressed after the trio pulls a prank on him, prompting them to take him out on the town. They plan on killing him to make themselves a quartet, but have a change of heart after the drunken therapist declares he will tell Carrigan off so they can stay in their home. However, James accidentally falls to his death. In the laboratory, the ghostly Carrigan confronts Casper and Kat, stealing what she believes to be the treasure from the vault and launching Dibs out a window when he tries to double-cross her. As Carrigan demands to be brought back to life, Casper and Kat remind her that Casper's treasure was her unfinished business and by getting it completed her unfinished business, causing her to be ejected into the afterlife. The treasure is revealed to be Casper's prized baseball, signed by Duke Snider; the map was part of a game Casper played with his father. James, now a ghost and still in his drunken state, returns with Casper's uncles; after bringing him back to his senses, Kat's despair over this prompts Casper to sacrifice his one chance to return to life, restoring James instead. The Halloween party kicks off upstairs; Amber and Vic's prank is thwarted by the Ghostly Trio, and they flee in terror. A boy dances with Kat, and is revealed to be Casper, temporarily granted physical form by Amelia, who had become an angel after her death. Amelia meets with James, explaining that the Ghostly Trio kept their promise to get him a meeting with her, and tells him that she was so content with her family while alive that she has no unfinished business and thus did not become a ghost. Amelia departs as the clock chimes ten, promising James that they and Kat will be together again one day; after kissing Kat, Casper transforms back into a ghost, inadvertently scaring the guests away, but Kat is nonetheless impressed with the party, and the Ghostly Trio play their nephew's theme for them to dance to.",

    "title": "The Little Mermaid",
    "plot": "Ariel is a mermaid princess and the youngest daughter of King Triton, ruler of the merpeople of Atlantica. She is fascinated with the human world despite never having seen it, as Triton forbids all merfolk from surfacing there after Ariel's mother was killed by a human. One night, Ariel sees fireworks above the ocean and surfaces to see them better. They come from the ship of Eric, the prince of a nearby island. When a storm arrives, the ship crashes against rocks, forcing all to go for the lifeboats. Ariel rescues Eric, brings him to shore, and sings to him, fleeing before he can regain full consciousness. Noticing Ariel's absent-minded behavior, Triton questions his advisor Sebastian the crab, who reveals that she saved a human. Enraged, Triton travels to Ariel's grotto and demands that she swear to never return to the surface. She refuses and he destroys her collection of human objects. Ariel is later approached by two moray eels sent by the sea witch Ursula, Triton's estranged sister and Ariel's aunt who was banished from Atlantica fifteen years prior. Ariel makes a deal with Ursula: she will turn Ariel human for three days in exchange for her voice, which Ursula will keep in a nautilus shell. During these three days, Ariel she must receive true love's kiss to remain human permanently. If Ariel fails, she will transform back into a mermaid and Ursula will claim her soul. After receiving human legs, she swims to the surface with Sebastian and her friend Flounder. In the human world, she is rescued and taken to Eric's castle. Eric, who has been searching for the woman who saved his life, rushes to meet Ariel. While exploring the castle, Ariel finds Eric's collection of items he accumulated over his travels. Eric spends time with her poring over his collection. The next day, Eric takes Ariel sightseeing around the kingdom. Sebastian, who has followed Ariel, discovers that Ursula has rigged the spell to make Ariel forget that she needs to kiss Eric. Along with Scuttle, a northern gannet, and Flounder, Sebastian takes it upon himself to get the pair to kiss. They are almost successful but are thwarted by Ursula's eels. Enraged by the close call, Ursula turns into a human and uses Ariel's voice to hypnotize Eric. Back in Atlantica, Triton has the kingdom search for Ariel and begins to regret the way he treated her. The next morning, Ariel and her friends discover that Eric will be announcing his engagement to \"Vanessa\" (Ursula's alter ego) later that day, believing she is the woman who saved him and sang to him on the beach. Ariel rushes to the engagement party, confronts Ursula, and breaks the shell. She gains back her voice, and the enchantment on Eric is broken. However, before they can kiss, the sun sets and Ariel transforms back into a mermaid. Reverting to her original form, Ursula drags Ariel back into the ocean. Wanting to save Ariel, Triton confronts Ursula. However, the deal that she made with Ariel is unbreakable. Triton trades himself for Ariel and is turned to dust by Flotsam and Jetsam before losing his authority over Atlantica, much to her horror. Ursula declares herself the Queen of the Seven Seas and claims Triton's trident when Eric arrives with a harpoon. Ursula attempts to kill Eric, but Ariel intervenes and attacks Ursula who accidentally kills Flotsam and Jetsam. Enraged, Ursula uses the trident to grow in size. Ariel and Eric reunite on the surface just before a gigantic Ursula separates them. She then gains full control of the ocean, creating a storm and bringing sunken ships to the surface before Ariel gets on one. Just as Eric is about to be killed, Ariel commandeers a wrecked ship and impales Ursula with its splintered bowsprit. Once Ursula dies, Triton comes back to life; he and Ariel recognize the other's sacrifice for them. Ariel returns home, where she is unhappy without Eric. On Sebastian's advice, Triton transforms Ariel into a human permanently, and she reunites with Eric. As Eric and Ariel are on the beach, the pair decide to travel together, with the blessing of both their parents and the support of people from both their worlds.",

    "title": "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button",
    "plot": "In August 2005, Daisy Fuller is on her deathbed in a New Orleans hospital. She tells her daughter Caroline about blind clockmaker Mr. Gateau, hired to make a clock for a train station in 1918. It ran backwards and was made as a memorial for those who lost their sons in World War I, like Gateau himself. Daisy then asks Caroline to read aloud from Benjamin Button's diary. On the evening of November 11, 1918, a boy is born with the proportions of an infant but the appearance and maladies of an elderly man. His mother, Caroline, dies soon after childbirth and his father, wealthy manufacturer Thomas Button, abandons him on the porch of a nursing home. Caretaker Queenie and cook Mr. Weathers find the baby, and Queenie raises him as her own, naming him Benjamin. As the years pass, Benjamin physically blends in with the elderly residents but has the mind of a child. Physically aging in reverse, he transitions from a wheelchair to crutches and learns to walk. On Thanksgiving 1930, Benjamin meets seven-year-old Daisy, whose grandmother lives in the nursing home, and they connect instantly. Later, he accepts work on the tugboat Chelsea captained by Mike Clark. Thomas introduces himself to Benjamin, but does not reveal his true identity. In autumn 1936, Benjamin leaves for a work engagement with the tugboat crew and travels around the world. He sends postcards to Daisy, who is accepted into a ballet company in New York City. In Murmansk in 1941, Benjamin becomes smitten with Elizabeth Abbott, wife of the chief minister of the British trade mission in Murmansk. Their affair eventually ends, leaving Benjamin heartbroken. That December, the United States enters World War II. Mike volunteers the Chelsea for U.S. Navy service, and they are assigned to salvage duties. They find a near sunken U.S. transport and thousands of dead American troops. The culprit, a German U-boat, surfaces and fires on the tugboat. Captain Mike rams the submarine and the resulting explosion sinks both. Most of the crew perishes except for Benjamin and Rick Brody, who are eventually rescued. In May 1945, Benjamin returns to New Orleans, reuniting with Queenie and learns that Weathers died. He reconnects with Daisy, who attempts to seduce him. However, Benjamin refuses, and she departs. Benjamin visits terminally ill Thomas and learns the details of his birth and family. Thomas gives his button manufacturing company and estate to Benjamin before dying. In 1947, Benjamin visits Daisy in New York unannounced but departs upon seeing her romantically involved with someone else. In 1954, Daisy's dancing career ends when her leg is crushed in an automobile accident in Paris. When Benjamin visits her, Daisy is amazed by his appearance, but, frustrated by her injuries, she tells him to stay out of her life. In 1962, Daisy returns to New Orleans and reunites with Benjamin. Now of comparable physical age, they fall in love. Queenie dies, and Benjamin and Daisy move in together. In 1967, Daisy, who has opened a ballet studio, announces she is pregnant. Their daughter, Caroline, is born in the spring of 1968. Believing he cannot be a proper father due to his reverse aging, Benjamin sells his assets, leaves the money for Daisy and Caroline, and leaves to travel alone during the 1970s. Benjamin, physically a young man, returns to Daisy in 1980. Now remarried, Daisy introduces him as a family friend to her husband Robert and daughter Caroline. She later visits him at his hotel, where they have sex and part once more. In 1990, recently widowed Daisy is contacted by social workers who found Benjamin, who is now physically a pre-teen. He was living in a condemned building, was taken to the hospital in poor physical condition, and his diary had her name in it. Benjamin displays early signs of dementia, so Daisy moves into the nursing home in 1997 and cares for Benjamin for the rest of his life as he regresses into infancy. In 2002, Gateau's clock is replaced with a properly working modern digital clock and in 2003, Benjamin dies in Daisy's arms, physically an infant but chronologically 85 years old. Back in 2005, having revealed that Benjamin is Caroline's father, Daisy dies. Hurricane Katrina floods a storage room holding Gateau's clock, which keeps ticking backwards.",

Her first order of business is to open the border between Auradon and Wonderland by inviting Princess Red, the rebellious daughter of the tyrannical Queen of Hearts, to join the school. Red and her mother travel to Auradon, where the Queen and Cinderella reunite for the first time since their days at Merlin Academy, the original name of Auradon Prep. The meeting quickly turns hostile as the Queen recalls a traumatic prank she endured during their time at school. During the opening ceremony, as Uma welcomes everyone, the Queen unexpectedly launches a coup d'état, with her magical deck of cards, and takes the other attendees hostage. When Cinderella refuses to bow to the Queen, a reluctant Red is forced to condemn her to death by beheading for treason, delighting her mother but angering the crowd. In horror and guilt, Red tries to use a magic pocket watch to go back a few minutes in time and prevent the coup by stealing her mother's deck of cards, but is attacked by Cinderella's perfectionist and kindhearted daughter Chloe, accidentally activating the watch and sending both girls to the past, when Auradon Prep was still called Merlin Academy. Believing they were sent for a reason, Red and Chloe begrudgingly agree to work together for the sake of their mothers. Posing as exchange students, Red and Chloe enroll at Merlin Academy and meet Ella and Bridget, the teenage personas of Cinderella and the Queen of Hearts, and begin to seek ways to change the \"present\". They are shocked at their mothers' personalities, with Bridget being nice to a fault and Ella having no interest in royalty. They all hang out in the courtyard when they meet the younger versions of the villains and Uliana, Ursula's younger sister. After purposely eating too many of Bridget's enchanted flamingo feathered cupcakes, Uliana turns into a flamingo. A short chase for Bridget insues, with it ending in Ella pulling Bridget away from Uliana, causing the latter to lose her balance, and fall into an artificial pond. When Uliana emerges from the water, having been reverted to her human form and humiliated in front of the whole school, she decides to take revenge on Bridget. They decide to talk to Ella to find out more, and find out that Uliana hangs out at the Black Lagoon. Red and Chloe overhear the plan to give Bridget a cupcake that will turn her into a monster during the dance, using a sorcerer's cookbook. Realizing this must have been the prank that turned Bridget evil, Red and Chloe find the cookbook in Merlin's study, and after struggling with the defenses Merlin has put in place, they are successful. However, the villains are able to take it from them, but because the book should not fall \"into the wrong hands,\" they are magically frozen, and Merlin discovers them and gives them detention. Red is able to hide the cookbook and the two of them head back to the present. They return to the time Uma was giving her speech, and the Queen of Hearts delivers the same lines she gave in the original timeline. Red is initially scared that nothing changed, but is relieved to see that her mom is wearing a lighter gown and creates a series of heart bubbles for the celebration. Through narration, Uma informs the audience that this is a happy ending, but hints that messing with the fabric of time can have dangerous consequences, and that the story is not over yet.",

Videocassette footage of the event is put in a time capsule that gets launched into outer space. In the present, Sam is an electronics installer who is summoned alongside lieutenant colonel Violet van Patten to the White House where Will, now the President of the United States, shows him surveillance footage of Andersen Air Force Base being besieged and left in the form of pixelated debris. Sam discovers the attack's resemblance to the game Galaga, but U.S. Navy leader James Porter warns Will of impeachment should Galaga be presented in the case. Sam meets up with Ludlow, who claims the attack was caused by aliens who mistook footage of the time capsule tape as a declaration of war and is challenging Earth to a best-of-three battle using technological replicas of the games, claiming Earth has lost the first match. Sam and Ludlow tell Will of a coordinated aim at North India, but Will dismisses their concerns. The aliens attack the Taj Mahal as Arkanoid and Earth loses the second match. Sam and Ludlow train Navy SEALs to play the games while Violet develops effective energy weapons. The team, calling themselves the \"Arcaders\", heads to London, where the aliens attack Hyde Park as Centipede before being defeated by Sam and Ludlow. Will, Ludlow and a reluctant Sam recruit an imprisoned Eddie to assist in New York City, where the Arcaders battle a giant Pac-Man in Mini Coopers colored like the ghosts. Tōru Iwatani tries to console his creation only to get his hand bitten off. Sam narrowly beats Pac-Man and wins, receiving Q*bert as a trophy. During a celebration at the White House however, the aliens announce that one of the Arcaders has cheated, meaning Earth forfeits the challenge. Violet's son Matty discovers Eddie cheated in the fight against Pac-Man using a code written on his glasses, which he also used in the 1982 Donkey Kong match. As Eddie flees and the aliens abduct Matty, Violet is dismissed from her rank. The aliens attack Washington, D.C. with an army of video game characters. Alongside Will and a repentant Eddie, the Arcaders fight through the aliens with leftover energy weapons while Ludlow is attacked by Lady Lisa, a video game character whom he has a crush on, but he persuades her to join him. Sam, Violet and Will are summoned to the alien's mother ship for a final chance to save Earth by facing their leader as Donkey Kong. The trio is placed on the starting level, with Donkey Kong and the captives at the top level. Noticing the random pattern of barrels and fireballs, Sam loses hope until Matty reveals Eddie's cheating. Realizing he is actually the world's best Donkey Kong player, Sam regains his spirit and defeats Donkey Kong, resulting in all the arcade characters disappearing, including Lisa. The Arcaders are hailed as heroes and Will negotiates a peace agreement with the aliens. Eddie apologizes to Sam for cheating and acknowledges him as the best Donkey Kong player. Seeing Ludlow devastated that Lisa is gone, Q*Bert cheers him up by sacrificing his existence by turning into Lisa.

    "plot": "While admiring a bright red rose blooming during a white winter, Queen Eleanor of Tabor pricks her finger on its thorns. Three drops of blood fall onto the snow, and she wishes for a daughter with skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, hair as black as a raven's wings, and a heart as strong as the rose. The queen gives birth to Snow White but falls ill and dies many years later. After her death, Snow White's father, King Magnus, and his army battle an invading army of glass soldiers. King Magnus finds a prisoner called Ravenna, becomes enchanted with her beauty and marries her the next day. Ravenna is in fact a powerful sorceress who used the false glass army to charm her way into the kingdom. On their wedding night, she confesses that there was a king much like Magnus that used her, hurt her, then discarded her. She kills him before taking over the kingdom. Snow White's childhood friend William and his father, Duke Hammond, escape but are unable to rescue her, and she is locked away in a tower for years. Ravenna does not know why she allowed Snow White to live, but has a feeling about her. Tabor and its people deteriorate under Queen Ravenna's rule. She periodically drains the youth from the kingdom's young women in order to maintain a spell cast over her as a child by her mother, which allows Ravenna to keep her youthful beauty. When Snow White comes of age, Ravenna learns from her Magic Mirror that Snow White is destined to destroy her unless she consumes the girl's heart, which will make her immortal. Ravenna sends her brother Finn to bring her the princess, but Snow White escapes into the Dark Forest, where Ravenna has no power. The Queen makes a bargain with Eric the Huntsman, a widower and drunkard, to capture her, promising to bring his wife back to life in exchange. However, when Finn reveals that Ravenna does not actually have the power to revive the dead, the Huntsman helps Snow White escape. The Duke and William learn that Snow White is alive, so William leaves the castle to find her, joining Finn's group as a bowman. Snow White saves the Huntsman's life by charming a troll that attacks them. They make their way to a fishing village populated by women who have disfigured themselves to make themselves useless to Ravenna. The Huntsman learns Snow White's true identity, and leaves her in the care of the women. He quickly returns when he sees the village being burned down by Finn's men. Snow White and the Huntsman evade them and meet a band of eight dwarfs. The blind dwarf, Muir, perceives that Snow White is the only person who can end Ravenna's reign. As they travel through a fairy sanctuary, they are attacked by Finn and his men. A battle ensues during which Finn, his men, and one of the dwarfs are killed. William joins the group on their journey to Hammond's castle. Ravenna disguises herself as William and tempts Snow White into eating a poisoned apple before fleeing. William kisses Snow White, though nothing happens. A single tear is shed from her eye. Snow White's body is taken to Hammond's castle. The Huntsman professes his regret for being unable to save her, as her heart and strength remind him of his wife, Sara. He kisses her yet does not notice a second tear fall from her eyes, as two kisses of true love break the spell. Snow White awakens and rallies the Duke's army to mount a siege against Ravenna. The dwarfs infiltrate the castle through the sewers and open the gates, allowing the army inside. Snow White and Ravenna fight. When Ravenna is about to kill her, Snow White uses a move the Huntsman taught her and stabs her to death in the heart.

    "plot": "In Winter River, Connecticut, Adam and Barbara Maitland are spending their vacation decorating their large country home that local real estate agent Jane Butterfield constantly pesters them to sell. As a hobby, Adam is building a scale model of the town in the attic. While the Maitlands are driving home from town, their car plunges off a bridge and into the river. Barbara and Adam arrive home but are unable to recall how they got there. When attempting to leave the house, Adam enters Saturn, an otherworldly desert-like landscape populated by enormous sandworms. The encounter lasts mere seconds for him, but after Barbara rescues him, she tells him he was gone for two hours. After discovering a Handbook for the Recently Deceased and noticing they now lack reflections, the couple realizes that they drowned in the river and are ghosts. The house is sold to New York real estate developer Charles Deetz and his second wife Delia, a talentless sculptor. Charles' teenage goth daughter, Lydia, lives with them. Under the guidance of interior designer Otho Fenlock, Delia begins renovating the house with a new-wave aesthetic of postmodern art. While consulting the Handbook on how to eject the Deetzes, the Maitlands see an advertisement for 'Betelgeuse'. Following the handbook's guidelines, they travel to an otherworldly waiting room filled with other distressed souls. After navigating the afterlife's complex bureaucracy, the Maitlands return home only to realize three months have passed and the house has been completely redesigned. Their caseworker Juno arrives and discloses the Maitlands must remain in their house for 125 years before \"moving on\", while discouraging them from contacting Betelgeuse, her former assistant-turned-freelance \"bio-exorcist\", to drive out the Deetzes. Betelgeuse can only be summoned by uttering his name three times. Juno recommends that the Maitlands haunt the Deetzes themselves. Adam and Barbara are invisible to Charles and Delia, which thwarts their fright attempts. Lydia, however, can see them, which she attributes to her peculiar nature. The Maitlands invoke Betelgeuse and are transported into the model. Betelgeuse's crude and morbid demeanor is offensive and they exit the model. The Maitlands possess Charles, Delia and their wealthy friends during a dinner party. Unexpectedly, their antics only amuse the group, inspiring Charles to pitch a supernatural theme park to investor Maxie Dean. The Deetzes uncover the town model in the attic, where Otho finds the Handbook. Betelgeuse transforms into a giant snake and terrorizes the Deetzes before Barbara banishes him back to the model. Juno calls Barbara and Adam back to the afterlife office and berates them for releasing Betelgeuse. Meanwhile, Lydia, depressed and blaming the Maitlands for Betelgeuse's attack, discovers Betelgeuse inside the model. She almost summons him in exchange for passage to the afterlife, but the Maitlands return and stop her. Maxie Dean arrives and demands evidence of paranormal occurrences, but the Maitlands refuse to manifest again. Otho uses the Handbook and conducts what he believes is a séance.

    "title": "Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters",
    "plot": "As in the original fairy tale, Hansel and Gretel as children are abandoned by their father in a forest, where they come across a gingerbread house. On entering it, they are captured by a cannibalistic witch, who makes Gretel prepare the oven while forcing Hansel to continuously eat sweets to fatten him up. The children outsmart her before she could eat them, incinerating her in the oven. Over the following many years, Hansel and Gretel, now in their adolescence, have become famed witch hunters, slaying many witches without succumbing to harmful spells and curses of the witchcraft; although the incident in the gingerbread house has left Hansel with a magic-induced form of diabetes and he needs to inject himself with a shot of insulin every few hours. Hansel and Gretel arrive in the town of Augsburg in time to prevent Sheriff Berringer from executing the young woman Mina for witchcraft. Mayor Engleman has hired the siblings to rescue the town's missing children, who are presumed abducted by witches. Berringer hires trackers for the same mission, hoping to disgrace the mayor and cementing his power. Hansel and Gretel capture the horned witch and discover that the witches are preparing for the coming Blood Moon, where they plan to sacrifice twelve children to gain immunity to fire, their greatest weakness. The mayor assigns Jackson, a local resident and tracker, to assist them in navigating the forest but they wait until morning before setting out. The grand dark witch, Muriel, attacks the town with her army and abducts the twelfth child. She attacks Gretel, who is rescued by Ben, a local teenager and avid fan of theirs who plans to become a witch hunter himself; Jackson is slain in the fight by Muriel after attempting to assist Gretel. Hansel falls from a witch's broomstick and is lost in the forest. The next morning, Mina finds him stuck in a tree and takes him to a nearby spring, where she heals his wounds and they make love in the healing waters of the spring. Gretel is attacked by Berringer and his posse, who beat her before being stopped by Muriel's troll, Edward. He kills all of the men and tells Gretel that he helped her because trolls serve witches. Hansel and Gretel discover an abandoned cabin that they learn is a witch's lair and their childhood home. Muriel tells them the truth of their past. Hansel and Gretel's mother was the great white witch Adrianna who married a farmer. On the night of the last Blood Moon, Muriel planned to complete the fire-protective potion, key to which is the heart of a grand white witch; as Adrianna’s white magic was more powerful than Muriel’s black magic, Muriel decided to use Gretel's heart instead. To get rid of Adrianna, she revealed to the townspeople that she was a witch. The angry rampaging mob burned her alive and hanged Hansel and Gretel's father, who had left them in the forest to protect them. Although Adrianna was a powerful witch, she'd never use her white magic against humans, even in self-defense. The siblings fight Muriel before she stabs Hansel and abducts Gretel to complete her long-overdue ceremony. Hansel wakes up with Mina, who reveals herself to be a white witch. She heals him again and uses Adrianna's grimoire to bless his arsenal of weapons. Hansel, Mina, and Ben disrupt the witches' Sabbath. Mina slaughters the witches with a Gatling gun while Hansel frees the children. Edward defies Muriel and releases Gretel, as punishment Muriel throws the troll off a cliff. Gretel finds Edward's lifeless body and manages to resuscitate him. Hansel, Ben, and Mina follow Muriel's trail to the original gingerbread house, now dilapidated and run-down. Muriel kills Mina before Hansel shoots her. The siblings engage her in a brutal fight that ends with them decapitating her with a shovel. They burn Muriel's body on a pyre and collect their reward for rescuing the children. In the end, they head out on their next witch hunt, now accompanied by Ben and Edward.",

    "title": "Jack the Giant Slayer",
    "plot": "In the Kingdom of Cloister, in a time long past, monks craft magic beans that grow into a large beanstalk. They reach the realm of Gantua, home to a race of giants. The giants kill the monks and attack the Earth below. Through the use of a magical crown created from a giant's heart, King Erik manages to control the giants and force them to return, and the beanstalk is cut down. When Erik dies, his crown and the remaining beans are buried with him to keep them safe. Years later, Jack, an 18-year-old peasant, is sent by his uncle to sell his horse Anser and his cart at market. There, he runs into a disguised Princess Isabelle, whom he defends from an attack. The royal guards takes Isabel back to the castle. Afterwards, Jack realizes that his cart was stolen. Meanwhile, Lord Roderick, advisor to King Brahmwell, has collected the beans and crown. A monk steals the beans, runs into Jack while trying to escape, and exchanges the beans for Anser. Warning Jack not to get the beans wet, the monk flees, pursued by the guards. Isabel later sneaks out of the castle again, but is caught in a storm before coming upon Jack's door. While they talk, the rain leaks into the house and wets a bean. It grows into a massive beanstalk that traps Isabel in the house as it is lifted into the sky. Jack attempts to free her, but is knocked away. The next morning, Brahmwell sends Roderick and other knights up the beanstalk to retrieve Isabel as Jack volunteers to join. During the climb, Roderick takes advantage of an accident to secretly cause most of the knight's deaths. After reaching Gantua, Roderick corners Jack and takes the remaining beans from him, though Jack secretly keeps one. The group splits up. Knights Elmont and Crawe are knocked out and taken captive by a giant. Roderick pushes knight Bald down a cliff. When another giant appears and eats servant Wicke, Roderick reveals the crown and forces the giants to obey him. Elmont and Crawe are taken to the two-headed leader of the giants Fallon and are reunited with Isabel. Fallon eats Crawe before Roderick arrives wearing the crown and takes command. He proclaims himself king of the giants, orders that Isabel and Elmont be eaten, and has the giants prepare to descend the beanstalk and conquer the world for him. Jack eventually kills the chef who was to cook Isabel and Elmont. The three flee towards the beanstalk, but find their way blocked by another giant. Jack and Elmont trick him into falling off the edge. When the giant hits the ground, the body is seen by Brahmwell. Fearing a giant invasion, he orders the beanstalk cut down. Jack and Isabel climb down the beanstalk while Elmont stays behind to fight Roderick, killing him. Fallon then takes the crown, claiming the title of king. Meanwhile, the beanstalk falls away and Elmont rides it to the ground. Isabel is reunited with Brahmwell, who rewards Jack for her rescue. The group departs and Jack remains behind. Fallon finds the remaining beans and uses them to grow more beanstalks which the giants ride to the ground. Reuniting with Anser, Jack sees the new beanstalks approaching and decides to warn Isabel. After they reach the safety of the city walls, the drawbridge is raised and oil is poured into the moat to light it on fire. Initially seeming to drown in the fiery moat, Fallon finds an underwater passageway into the catacombs under the castle, breaking into the throne room and capturing Jack and Isabel in the process. Jack throws the final bean down Fallon's throat. The bean grows into another beanstalk, ripping Fallon apart. Jack takes the crown and uses it to stop the giants' attack. The giants are sent back to Gantua and forced to cut down their beanstalks. Brahmwell allows Jack and Isabelle to marry, who eventually have twin children. Their story becomes a popular fairy tale and the crown is secretly crafted into St Edward's Crown. In the present day Tower of London, a boy, Roderick's descendant, gazes at the crown. Meanwhile, Gantua still exists above London.",

    "plot": "In 3067 B.C., a warrior known as the Scorpion King leads an army to conquer the world. However, they are eventually defeated, and he is exiled to the desert of Ahm Shere. Dying, the King vows to give Anubis his soul in return for the power to defeat his enemies. Anubis accepts, conjuring an oasis and golden pyramid, and giving the King an army of jackal-like warriors to conquer Egypt. However, once his task is finished, Anubis claims his soul, and the army is returned to the Underworld. In 1933 A.D., seven years after the defeat of Imhotep, Rick O'Connell and his wife, Evelyn, explore ancient ruins with their son, Alex, finding the Bracelet of Anubis. In London, Alex plays with the bracelet, which locks onto his wrist, showing him visions that lead to Ahm Shere. Evelyn is kidnapped by a cult who resurrect Imhotep with the Book of the Dead, wishing to use his power to defeat the King; this would give them command of Anubis's army. The cult, led by museum curator Baltus Hafez, includes enforcer Lock-Nah and Meela Nais, the physical reincarnation of Imhotep's love Anck-su-namun. Rick and Alex set out to rescue Evelyn with the help of her brother Jonathan, who had gotten his hands on a golden scepter, and the Medjai Ardeth Bay, who has returned to help them. Rick frees Evelyn before she is sacrificed and they fight against Imhotep. Meanwhile, Alex is kidnapped and forced to lead the cult with the bracelet. The O'Connells pursue them with Rick's associate Izzy. En route, Alex secretly leaves clues for his parents, who follow in Izzy's dirigible. Imhotep uses the Book to restore Anck-su-namun's soul into Meela's body. By doing so, he unwittingly allows Evelyn to unlock the memories of her previous life as Princess Nefertiri, the bracelet's keeper. At the edge of the Oasis, Imhotep realizes that they are being pursued and uses his powers to attack the dirigible. The dirigible eventually crashes into the oasis's jungle, and Izzy chooses to stay behind to repair it. The O'Connells, Ardeth, Alex, and the cult are eventually attacked by pygmy mummies. Rick retrieves Alex while Ardeth kills Lock-Nah. They escape from the pygmies, who kill all of the cult members except for Hafez, Imhotep, and Anck-su-namun. Rick and Alex race to the pyramid before the sun light reaches it, saving Alex's life and allowing the bracelet to release his hand. Anck-su-namun, Imhotep, and Hafez then arrive and kill Evelyn before entering the pyramid. Inside the pyramid, Imhotep loses his powers and is forced to face the King as a mortal. Hafez uses the bracelet to conjure Anubis's army, which appears in the desert outside of the Oasis. Rick finds Imhotep summoning the King and attacks him. The King, now an enormous scorpion monster, interrupts the fight. Imhotep tricks him into attacking Rick. Outside, Ardeth and the Medjai battle Anubis's resurrected army. While Rick and the King fight, Hafez is caught in the melee and dies. Meanwhile, Jonathan and Alex steal the Book from Anck-su-namun and use it to resurrect Evelyn. Rick discovers hieroglyphs explaining that Jonathan's scepter is the mystic Spear of Osiris, the only weapon capable of killing the King. Meanwhile, Evie fights with Anck-su-namun. Aided by Jonathan, Rick gets the spear and uses it to slay the King, sending him and the army of Anubis back into the Underworld. As the oasis begins to implode and the pyramid crumbles, Rick and Imhotep cling to the ledge of a pit that leads to the underworld. Rick implores Evelyn to escape, but she risks her life to pull him to safety. Seeing this, Imhotep pleads for Anck-su-namun to do the same, but she abandons him. Heartbroken, Imhotep lets go and plummets into the underworld. While fleeing, Anck-su-namun inadvertently falls into a pit of scorpions and dies. Izzy then arrives with the repaired dirigible and rescues the O'Connells just before the oasis and the pyramid are destroyed—though not before Jonathan swipes a diamond. They depart into the sunset, with Ardeth saluting them before riding away.",

    "plot": "Stéphane Miroux (Gael García Bernal) is a shy young man whose vivid dreams often interfere with his waking life. After the death of his divorced father in Mexico, Stéphane moves to Paris to live closer to his mother Christine. He moves into his childhood home and starts a new job his mother has found for him in a calendar printing company. Stéphane had been told it was a creative job and shows his new colleagues his drawings, a collection of twelve illustrations depicting unique disasters. He calls his collection \"disasterology\". But nobody at his new job appreciates his talents – the job is no more than typesetting work, leaving him frustrated, as revealed in his dreams. While leaving his apartment to go to work one day, the new neighbour Stéphanie (Charlotte Gainsbourg) invites him into her apartment; he soon realizes that she is creative and artistic. They plan a project together, a short animated film based around a boat Stéphanie was making. As the story begins to unfold, surrealistic and naturalistic elements begin to overlap within Stéphane's reality, and the viewer is often uncertain of which portions constitute reality and which are dreams. One dream sequence, in which Stéphane dreams his hands become absurdly giant, was inspired by a recurring nightmare director Michel Gondry had as a child. As the line between dream and reality gradually becomes more blurred, Stéphane becomes enamoured with Stéphanie, and he shares his inventions with her, such as the 'one-second time machine'. Stéphane's dreams begin to encroach on his waking life, making him unsure of reality and whether Stéphanie's feelings for him are real. Stéphanie's toy horse is named Golden The Pony Boy, a reference to The Outsiders, the meaning poignantly hinting at Stèphane's regression and childlike behaviour around Stéphanie, which could stem from the loss of his father. He implants a mechanism inside Golden the Pony Boy that will make it gallop. He later receives a call from Stéphanie thanking him; she reveals the pony was named after him. To Stéphane's surprise, the calendar manufacturer accepts his \"disasterology\" idea and the company has a party in his honor, but he begins drinking excessively after he witnesses Stéphanie dancing with another man. The next day, the two have a confrontation in their hallway when Stéphane announces that he does not want to be Stéphanie's friend any longer. Stéphanie offers to discuss their issues on a date, but on his way there Stéphane has a vision that she is not there. He runs to her apartment and bangs on her door, when in actuality, she is waiting for him at the café. Stéphanie returns home, while Stéphane decides to move back to Mexico. Before leaving, Stéphane's mother insists that he says a formal goodbye to his next-door neighbor, Stéphanie. In his attempt to do so, he becomes crass, making offensive jokes. As his antagonistic behaviour pushes her, Stéphanie asks Stéphane to leave but he climbs into her bed, noticing two items on her bedside: his one-second time machine, and the finished boat they planned to use in their animated film. The film closes with Stéphane and Stéphanie riding Golden the Pony Boy across a field before sailing off into the sea in her boat.",

The boy boards the train after being invited by the Conductor, befriending a spirited girl and a know-it-all boy in the passenger car. The train stops to pick up a boy named Billy, whom the boy saves from missing the train's departure by pulling the emergency brake. Billy chooses to sit alone in the observation car. The children are served hot chocolate, and the girl leaves with the Conductor to give Billy a cup. The boy loses the girl's unstamped ticket while attempting to return it to her, which blows through the wilderness and eventually finds its way back onto the train. When the girl discovers that her ticket is missing, the Conductor escorts her out of the passenger car. Fearing that she will be disembarked from the train, the boy travels across the train's roof to find her, aided by a ghostly hobo. Upon reaching the engine, he finds the girl driving the train, as the driver and fireman repair the headlamp. Following a near miss with a herd of caribou, a throttle malfunction sends the train speeding through a steep hill onto a frozen lake. A lost throttle pin nearly causes a disaster before the driver regains control, steering the train towards the other side. The train arrives at the North Pole, where the Conductor announces that one of the children will be chosen to receive the first gift of Christmas from Santa himself. While trying to convince Billy to join in the festivities, the boy and the girl accidentally uncouple the observation car from the train, causing it to roll along a track into Santa's workshop, where Billy finds a present addressed to him. They are dumped into Santa's sack, where they also find the know-it-all boy. After the sack is loaded onto Santa's sleigh, the elves escort them out. The Conductor, children, and elves assemble outside with a large Christmas tree, moments before Santa arrives. During the celebration, a bell flies loose from the galloping reindeer's reins; the boy initially cannot hear it ring, until he finds it within himself to believe. Santa lets him keep the bell as the first gift of Christmas. Santa departs, wishing everyone a Merry Christmas. The children board the train to return home, and the boy discovers that he lost the bell through a hole in his pocket. The Conductor personally wishes the boy a Merry Christmas. On Christmas morning, the boy finds a present containing his lost bell with a note from Santa. He and his younger sister joyfully ring the bell, but their parents cannot hear it due to their disbelief in Santa. The boy recalls his friends, and sister eventually falling deaf to the bell as their belief faded over the years. Although he is now an adult, the bell still rings for him, as it does \"for all who truly believe\".",

    "title": "Perfume: The Story of a Murderer",
    "plot": "The film begins with the sentencing of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, a notorious murderer. The story of his life is told in flashback. He is seen born and abandoned in a French fish market by his mother, who is almost immediately hanged. Raised in an orphanage, Grenouille grows into a strangely detached boy with a superhuman sense of smell. After growing to maturity as a tanner's apprentice, he makes his first delivery to Paris, where he revels in all the new scents. He is particularly enchanted by a redheaded girl selling yellow plums, following her and attempting to sniff her, but he startles her with his behavior. To prevent her from crying out, he covers her mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing she is dead, he strips her naked and smells her all over, becoming distraught when her scent fades. Afterward, he is haunted by the desire to recreate her aroma. When making a delivery to a perfume shop, Grenouille amazes the Italian owner, Giuseppe Baldini, with his ability to create fragrances. He revitalizes the perfumer's career with new formulas, demanding only that Baldini teach him how to preserve scents. Baldini explains that all perfumes are harmonies of twelve scents, and may contain a theoretical thirteenth scent. Grenouille is saddened to learn that Baldini's method of distillation will not capture the scents of all objects (or rather, people). Baldini informs Grenouille of another method in Grasse, and provides him the journeyman papers in exchange for 100 new perfume formulas. Immediately after Grenouille departs, however, Baldini dies when his shaky apartment building collapses with him in it. En route to Grasse, Grenouille decides to exile himself from society, taking refuge in a cave. During this time, he discovers that he himself lacks any personal scent, and he believes this is why he is perceived as strange or disturbing by others. Deciding to continue his quest, he leaves his cave. On arrival in Grasse, he catches the scent of Laure Richis, the redheaded daughter of the wealthy Antoine Richis, and decides that she will be his \"thirteenth scent\", the linchpin of his perfume. He finds a job and learns the method of enfleurage. He starts experimenting by first killing a young woman and attempting to extract her scent using hot enfleurage, which fails. He attempts cold enfleurage on a prostitute he murders, and successfully preserves her scent. Having perfected his method, he embarks on a killing spree, targeting young women and capturing their scents. He dumps their naked corpses around the city, creating panic. After preserving the first twelve scents, he plans his attack on Laure. Worried about his daughter's safety, Richis flees the city with her, but Grenouille tracks her scent to a seaside inn and murders her while Richis is asleep. Soldiers capture Grenouille moments after he finishes preparing his perfume. On the day of his execution, he applies the perfume on himself. The executioner and the crowd are speechless at the intoxicating scent; they declare Grenouille innocent before falling into a massive orgy. Richis approaches him with his sword, but is overwhelmed by the scent and embraces Grenouille as his son. Walking out of Grasse unscathed, Grenouille has enough perfume to rule the world, but has discovered that it cannot help him to love nor be loved like a normal person. Disenchanted by his aimless quest, he returns to the Parisian fish market where he was born and pours the remaining perfume over his head. Overwhelmed by the scent, the nearby crowd devours him. The next morning, all that is left are his clothes and the perfume bottle, out of which one final drop falls.",

    "plot": "In 1940s Shanghai, a powerful gang called the Crocodile gang terrorizes the police. However, the gang was easily and brutally defeated by a much more powerful gang known as the Axe Gang, led by a young killer named Brother Sum and an unnamed vice general. Only Shanghai's poorest villages and slums are not affected by the Axe gang's killings. One of those slums is Pigsty Alley. Two thieves named Sing and Bone visit the village to extort the residents by pretending to be Axe gang members, though Sing and Bone are revealed to be very weak and horrible at fighting. However, Sing's stupid actions eventually attract the attention of some real gang members and their vice general after he threw a firecracker that exploded onto the vice general's head. Just as the vice general was about to kill one of the residents, an unknown force blows him 50 feet back while also breaking his back, causing the full gang to arrive. However, they were all quickly dealt with by three of the slum's tenants: Coolie (who revealed himself to be the one who killed the vice general), Tailor, and Donut, who are actually kung fu masters. However, fearing the Axe Gang's retaliation, the slum's Landlady evicts the trio. The gang captures Sing and Bone and Brother Sum tried to kill them for posing as gang members. However, Sing and Bone narrowly escape using their lock picking skills, impressing Brother Sum, who offers to let them join the Axe Gang, on the condition that they kill someone. Sing recalls his childhood to Bone when he was tricked by a vagrant into buying a martial arts pamphlet with his meager savings. After practicing the pamphlet's Buddhist Palm technique, Sing attempted to save a non-verbal girl named Fong from bullies, but was instead beaten and humiliated. Sing became adamant that heroes never win, and resolved to be a villain. Sing and Bone return to Pigsty Alley to kill the Landlady by throwing a knife at her, but fail ridiculously as Sing ended up getting stabbed twice and bit by venomous snakes. They were then chased off the premises by the Landlady. Sing retreats to a traffic pulpit where his injuries mysteriously heal instantly. Meanwhile, Brother Sum, intent on vengeance against Pigsty Alley, hires two Harpists that use a magical guzheng as their weapon. They successfully eliminate all three masters, but are destroyed by the Landlady and her husband the Landlord, who reveal themselves to be extremely skilled fighters. Sing attempts to rob an ice cream vendor, but discovers that she is actually Fong. When she recognizes him and offers him a lollipop, which reminds him of the day he tried to save her, he smashes it and leaves. When Sing returns to the gang’s casino, Brother Sum offers him immediate gang membership if he uses his lock-picking skills to free the Beast, a legendary and extremely powerful assassin, from a mental asylum. Sing succeeds and brings the Beast back to the Axe Gang's headquarters. Brother Sum is initially skeptical of the Beast due to his flippant attitude and sloppy appearance, but quickly changes his mind when the Beast stops a bullet midair. The Beast meets the Landlady and Landlord at the casino next door, engaging them in a fierce fight that ends in a stalemate, despite the Beast showing much better fighting skills and clever trickery. Sing, realizing the error of his ways, attacks Brother Sum and the Beast, who angrily retaliates but accidentally unlocks the Ren and Du channels in Sing. The Landlady and Landlord grab the unconscious Sing and flee. The Beast kills an angry Brother Sum and takes over as leader of the Axe gang. The Landlady and Landlord treat Sing at Pigsty Alley and are surprised by his quick recovery. The Landlady deduces Sing is, in fact, a natural-born kung fu genius. With his newfound powers, Sing effortlessly dispatches the Axes before fighting the Beast. Sing uses the Buddhist Palm technique to neutralize the Beast, who concedes defeat. Sing and Bone open a candy store with Fong's lollipop as their logo. Fong visits Sing at his store, and the pair hold each other's hands as they appear to be younger version of themselves. The vagrant who sold the pamphlet to Sing can be seen outside selling other pamphlets.",

    "plot": "Teenage musician Anna Coleman lives in Los Angeles with her younger brother Harry, their widowed psychologist mother Tess, and grandfather Alan. Tess is engaged to Ryan Volvo, but Anna has not accepted the engagement, still coping with the death of her father three years earlier. At school, Anna contends with unsympathetic teachers, bullying from her former best friend Stacey Hinkhouse, and an infatuation with a classmate named Jake Austin, whom Tess disapproves of. Anna plays guitar in a band, Pink Slip, which is preparing to audition for a spot in the Wango Tango showcase. However, the audition coincides with Tess and Ryan's wedding rehearsal, preventing Anna from attending. During dinner at Pei-Pei's Chinese restaurant, Anna and Tess argue. Pei-Pei's mother overhears them arguing and gives them fortune cookies, which they open while reading the fortunes aloud simultaneously. An earthquake then occurs, which only Anna and Tess feel. The next morning, they discover they have switched bodies. Tess attends high school as Anna and experiences firsthand the challenges her daughter faces, including targeted mistreatment by English teacher Elton Bates, who holds a grudge after Tess rejected him at their prom decades earlier. Tess threatens to report him unless he treats Anna fairly. Meanwhile, Anna, inhabiting Tess's body, struggles to manage her mother's patients and the responsibilities of adulthood. They return to the restaurant, where Pei-Pei explains that only an act of selfless love can reverse the switch. While attending Harry's parent–teacher conference, Anna reads a heartfelt essay he wrote about her, prompting her to treat him more kindly. Tess, attempting to reconcile with Stacey, is framed for cheating and sent to detention. Jake helps her complete the test, leading Tess to reevaluate her opinion of him. However, her decision to sabotage Stacey's exam upsets Jake. At the same time, Anna—still in Tess's body—is surprised with an impromptu live TV interview about Tess's latest book. Having not read it, she improvises a monologue about aging. Tess and Jake watch the segment, which mortifies the former and amuses the latter. Anna later visits Jake at work, where they connect over music. At the rehearsal dinner, her bandmates get caught attempting to sneak her out for the audition. Ryan allows her to leave, hoping to build trust. Tess and Anna switch roles at the audition, with Anna playing guitar offstage while Tess pretends to perform.

    "plot": "King Magnifico and his wife, Queen Amaya, establish the kingdom of Rosas on an island in the Mediterranean Sea. Having studied sorcery, Magnifico is able to grant the greatest desires of his subjects, but they have to give up the memory of their wishes to be sealed away and protected by the king until he can grant them. Once a month, at a ceremonial event, Magnifico chooses one wish to be granted. Years later, 17-year-old Asha prepares to interview for the job of Magnifico's apprentice on the day of her grandfather Sabino's 100th birthday, hoping that Magnifico will grant Sabino's wish to inspire people. The interview goes well until Asha requests for Sabino's wish to be granted, which Magnifico declines, seeing the wish's elusiveness as a potential threat to his power. Asha realizes Magnifico never intends to return the ungranted wishes to their owners, and when she questions his methods, Magnifico refuses to accept her apprenticeship or grant any of her family's wishes. Asha tries but fails to convince Sabino and her mother Sakina that Magnifico is deceiving them. Distraught, she makes her own wish on a star, and to her surprise, the star descends from the sky in the form of an anthropomorphic ball of light, which Asha names Star. Star's magic gives the forest animals, including Asha's pet goat Valentino, the ability to talk, and they tell her that all life is made of stardust. Encouraged, Asha enlists Star's help in retrieving her family's wishes. Everyone in the kingdom senses Star's presence, and Magnifico feels intimidated by it. Despite Amaya's pleas, he turns to forbidden dark magic to maintain his position of power as his subjects begin to doubt his way of ruling. Asha retrieves Sabino's wish and he is overjoyed to be able to remember it, but Magnifico arrives to arrest them, having been informed that Asha was responsible for Star's summoning. Corrupted by the dark magic, Magnifico intends to use Star's magic and Rosas's wishes to increase his own power, forcing Sabino and Sakina to flee to a nearby island while Asha, Star, and Valentino stay behind to free the citizens' wishes. One of Asha's friends, Simon, is revealed to be the one who sold her out to Magnifico, in hopes that his wish to become a knight would be granted. Magnifico grants the wish, but additionally bewitches Simon into being his henchman and capturing Asha. Asha rallies her other friends Dahlia, Gabo, Hal, Bazeema, Safi, and Dario to put an end to Magnifico's reign. Amaya also joins them, having discovered Magnifico's corruption. While her friends infiltrate Magnifico's study and open up the ceiling to free the wishes, Asha tries to distract Magnifico, only to be tricked by a disguised Simon, whom she defeats with the animals' help. Magnifico ascends the castle's tower, absorbing the power of every wish and trapping Star. Asha attempts to stop him but is easily overpowered as Magnifico blocks out the sky and immobilizes the citizens, preventing them from wishing on stars. Unwilling to give up, Asha remembers the animals' message from before and encourages the citizens to make a wish about changing Rosas's future. The strength of their collective desire overpowers Magnifico, releasing the wishes from him and freeing Star. Magnifico's magic turns against him and traps him inside his staff's mirror, while the citizens regain their sealed wishes with a newfound appreciation of pursuing them. Amaya becomes the sole ruler of Rosas, helping the citizens make their wishes come true on their own. A regretful Simon is forgiven by Asha and her friends. Star gifts Asha with a magic wand so that she can inspire people to keep dreaming before returning to the sky among the other stars.",

    "title": "Pan's Labyrinth",
    "plot": "In a fairy tale, Princess Moanna, whose father is the king of the underworld, visits the human world, where the sunlight blinds her and erases her memory. She becomes mortal and eventually dies. The king believes that eventually her spirit will return to the underworld, so he builds labyrinths around the world which act as portals, in preparation for her return. In 1944 Francoist Spain, ten-year-old Ofelia travels with her pregnant mother Carmen to meet Captain Vidal, her new stepfather. Vidal, a Civil Guard officer of the Armed Police Corps and devotee of Falangism, has been assigned to hunt down the Spanish Maquis. A large stick insect, which Ofelia believes to be a fairy, leads Ofelia into an ancient stone labyrinth, but she is stopped by Vidal's housekeeper Mercedes, who is secretly supporting her brother Pedro and other members of the Maquis. That night, the insect appears in Ofelia's bedroom, where it transforms into a fairy and leads her through the labyrinth. There, she meets a faun, who believes she is the reincarnation of Princess Moanna. He gives her a book and tells her she will find in it three tasks to complete in order for her to acquire immortality and return to her kingdom. During a dinner with several important figures, Vidal announces that he will stockpile food and supplies in the granary in order to weaken the Maquis and their collaborators. The local population can only access supplies through ration cards. Vidal secures the granary with a thick padlock, to which Mercedes pretends to give him a unique copy of the key. Ofelia completes the first task — retrieving a key from the belly of a giant toad — but becomes worried about her mother, whose condition is worsening. The faun gives Ofelia a mandrake root, instructing her to keep it under Carmen's bed and regularly supply it with blood, which seems to ease Carmen's illness. Accompanied by three fairy guides and equipped with a piece of magic chalk, Ofelia then completes the second task — retrieving a dagger from the lair of the Pale Man, a child-eating monster. Despite the faun's warning not to consume anything there, she gives in to her temptation and eats two grapes, awakening the Pale Man. He devours two of the fairies and chases Ofelia, but she manages to escape. Infuriated at her disobedience, the faun refuses to give Ofelia the third task and abandons her. During this time, Ofelia becomes aware of Vidal's ruthlessness in the course of hunting down the Maquis. After killing two local farmers (who only hunted rabbits), Vidal interrogates and tortures a captive member of the Maquis, who turns out to be a stutterer and fails to escape unscathed when Vidal orders him to count to 3 without stuttering. He asks Doctor Ferreiro to tend to the captive, whom Ferreiro then euthanises at his own urging. Realising that Ferreiro is collaborating with the Maquis, Vidal kills him. He later catches Ofelia tending to the mandrake root, which Vidal considers delusional for devouring fairy tales. Carmen agrees and throws the root into the fire. She immediately develops painful contractions and dies giving birth to Vidal's son. Days later, the Maquis launch an attack to distract Vidal and his men and steal supplies from the barn, using a second copy of the key Mercedes gave to Pedro. Upon returning to the barn, Vidal discovers that the lock has not been forced. A discovered spy, Mercedes tries to escape with Ofelia, but they are caught. Ofelia is locked in her bedroom, while Mercedes is taken to be interrogated since the stutterer had indirectly betrayed her before dying, as well as finding several stored provisions from the barn in his possession confirming Vidal's suspicions about Mercedes. Mercedes frees herself, and stabs Vidal non-lethally in her escape to re-join the Maquis. The faun, having changed his mind about giving Ofelia a chance to perform the third task, returns and tells her to bring her newborn brother into the labyrinth to complete it. Ofelia retrieves the baby and flees into the labyrinth. Vidal pursues her as the Maquis launch an attack on a Civil Guard outpost. Ofelia meets the faun at the centre of the labyrinth. The faun suggests drawing a small amount of the baby's blood, as completing the third task and opening the portal to the underworld requires the blood of an innocent, but Ofelia refuses to harm her brother. Vidal finds her talking to the faun, whom he cannot see. The faun leaves, and Vidal takes the baby from Ofelia's arms before shooting her. Vidal returns to the labyrinth's entrance, where he is surrounded by the Maquis, including Mercedes and Pedro. Knowing that he will be killed, he hands the baby to Mercedes, asking that his son be told the time of his father's death, wanting to smash his pocket watch the same way Vidal's father had done during the war. Mercedes replies that his son will not even know his name, before Pedro shoots Vidal dead. Mercedes enters the labyrinth and comforts a dying Ofelia. Drops of Ofelia's blood fall down the centre of the spiral stone staircase onto an altar. Ofelia, well dressed and uninjured, then appears in a golden throne room. The King of the underworld tells her that, by choosing to spill her own blood rather than that of another, she passed the final test. The faun praises Ofelia for her choice, addressing her as \"Your Highness\". The Queen of the underworld, her mother, invites Ofelia to sit next to her father and rule at his side. Back in the stone labyrinth, Ofelia smiles as she dies. The epilogue completes the tale of Princess Moanna, stating that she returned to the Underworld, ruled with kindness and justice for many centuries, and left little traces of her time in the human realm, \"visible only to those who know where to look.\"",

    "plot": "In the summer in the 1950s, timid sea monster child Luca Paguro herds goatfish off the coast of the Italian town of Portorosso. One day, Luca meets Alberto Scorfano, a fellow sea monster kid living alone in an abandoned lighthouse. Alberto demonstrates how sea monsters transform into humans when they are dry. Luca begins sneaking out to meet Alberto against his parents' order to stay away from the surface, fearing that he might be hunted by humans. The boys quickly become friends, wishing to own a Vespa and travel around the world. Upon discovering Luca's actions, his parents decide to send him to live in the deep with his uncle Ugo. To avoid this, Luca runs away from home and hides in Portorosso with Alberto. The boys run afoul of Ercole Visconti, the local bully and five-time champion of the Portorosso Cup, a triathlon of swimming, pasta-eating, and biking. When Ercole tries to soak Luca in a fountain, Giulia Marcovaldo, a young girl, stops him. In hopes of winning the money needed for a Vespa, the boys team up with Giulia for the triathlon. Giulia invites them to stay at her house and introduces her fisherman father, Massimo, who is prejudiced against sea monsters. Meanwhile, Luca's parents infiltrate the town to find their son. Giulia and Luca bond over their love of learning, to Alberto's ire. When Luca shows interest in attending school, Alberto intentionally reveals his own sea monster form to Giulia to prevent it, frightening her. Unwilling to give himself up, Luca feigns shock at the transformation, and a betrayed Alberto flees as Ercole's gang arrives to hunt him. Shortly after, Giulia finds out that Luca is a sea monster as well, and sends him away for his safety. Luca heads to Alberto's hiding place in an effort to reconcile with him, and learns that Alberto was abandoned by his father long ago. Though Alberto declines to participate in the triathlon, Luca promises to win the Vespa to rebuild their friendship. The triathlon begins with Luca and Giulia competing separately. Luca successfully completes the swimming race in a diving suit and the pasta-eating contest without revealing himself, but it begins to rain during the bike race. Alberto shows up to give Luca an umbrella, but Ercole knocks it away, exposing Alberto's sea monster form and shocking the spectators and Ercole. Luca rescues Alberto, revealing his own true form, and the two bike towards the finish to get to the sea. Giulia deliberately collides with Ercole's bike to stop him from harpooning Luca and Alberto, falling down and injuring herself badly in the process. Luca and Alberto unintentionally cross the finish line before turning back to help Giulia. When Ercole and the other townsfolk confront the boys, Massimo stands up for them and insists that they have won after seeing that Luca and Alberto had stopped to help Giulia. Luca is reunited with his family and the humans accept the sea monsters, except Ercole, who is thrown into a fountain by his much-abused henchmen Ciccio and Guido. Luca and Alberto buy an old Vespa with their winnings, but Alberto sells it to get a train ticket for Luca, allowing him to go to school in Genova with Giulia. Luca's family, Massimo, and Alberto see Luca and Giulia off at the train station, where they all promise to stay in touch. Luca meets Giulia's mother and attends school with Giulia, while Massimo adopts Alberto as his son.",

When Bruce's rival, Evan Baxter, is given the job, a vulgar on-camera outburst leads to Bruce's dismissal. Bruce complains to God that \"he's the one that should be fired\". He receives a pager message, leading him to a warehouse where he meets God in human form. God gives Bruce his powers, to test him. He cannot tell others he has them, nor can he use the powers against others' free will. Bruce is initially jubilant using the powers for personal gain, such as regaining his previous job and impressing his girlfriend, Grace Connelly. Bruce uses his powers to cause miraculous events, such as discovering Jimmy Hoffa's body during a segment on police training and causing a meteorite to harmlessly land near a cook-off, earning him the nickname \"Mr. Exclusive\". He makes the Buffalo Sabres win the Stanley Cup. Bruce causes Evan to get fired by embarrassing himself on-air, so that Bruce is appointed as the new anchor. Bruce hears voices in his head and God explains that the voices are prayers that Bruce must deal with. Bruce creates an email system to receive the prayers and respond, but there are too many, so he sets the program to answer every prayer Yes automatically. Bruce attends a party to celebrate his promotion. When Grace arrives, she finds Bruce being kissed by his co-anchor, Susan Ortega, who forced herself on him, and leaves. Bruce tries to use his powers to convince her to stay, but cannot influence her free will. He realizes that Buffalo has fallen into chaos due to his actions: some believe the Apocalypse is imminent due to the meteor strikes, while a large number of people, all having prayed to win the multi-million dollar lottery and received a meager amount in return, have started rioting everywhere. Bruce returns to God, who explains that he cannot solve all the problems and Bruce must figure out a way. Bruce then starts to help others without using his powers, including having Evan reinstated as anchor. He returns to his computer at home and views Grace's prayers, wishing for his success and well-being. As Bruce reads them, another arrives, wishing not to be in love with him any more. Bruce walks alone on a highway, asking God to take back his powers and leaving his fate in his hands. He is hit by a truck and regains consciousness in a white void, apparently dead. God appears and asks Bruce what he really wants; Bruce only wants to make sure Grace finds a man who will make her happy. God agrees, and Bruce awakes on the roadside, undergoing defibrillation. Grace visits him in hospital and they reconcile. Following his full recovery, Bruce returns to his field reporting job, deciding to take pleasure in the simple news stories in Buffalo.",

    "plot": "In 1493 Germany, Baron Frederick Hoffman and his pregnant wife Lilliana are driving home through the woods when Lilliana goes into labor. Their carriage is attacked by wolves, which kill their coachman, while Lilliana is mortally wounded. Frederick is forced to perform a caesarean section on her to save their unborn daughter, whom he names Lilli in honor of his deceased wife. Seven years later, Frederick remarries the French noblewoman Claudia Alvise, who arrives at the Hoffman residence with her mute brother Gustav and an ornate mirror that belonged to their witch mother. Although Claudia tries to win over Lilli, the latter still mourns her mother and refuses to accept her stepmother. On Frederick and Claudia's wedding night, Lilli witnesses her nanny being killed by a mysterious force from Claudia's mirror, which increases her distrust of her stepmother. Nine years later, a teenaged Lilli starts a relationship with a young doctor, Peter Gutenberg, and dreams of leaving home, while Claudia is pregnant with her first child. The Hoffmans throw a ball, and Lilli arrives dressed in her mother's gown, taking Frederick's attention away from Claudia. Hurt and jealous, Claudia goes into premature labor and the baby is a stillborn, while she is rendered unable to have other children. The spirit from Claudia's mirror in the form of her reflection consoles her and promises revenge on Lilli. Feeling guilty, Lilli apologizes to Claudia, unaware that the latter has decided to kill her. Several weeks later, Gustav attacks Lilli while she is walking outside, forcing her to flee into the woods. Gustav brings Claudia a pig's heart, as if it were Lilli's, but the mirror reveals his trick, and Claudia curses her brother with hallucinations that drive him to suicide. Frederick and Peter go in search of Lilli, but the former gets injured and they are forced to return home. In the forest, Lilli discovers an abandoned abbey, where she is confronted by a group of seven societal outcasts; one of them, Rolf, offers to get a ransom for Lilli and tries to rape her, but their leader, Will, drives him away. With nowhere else to go, Lilli follows the group into the mine. Claudia uses witchcraft to cause a mine collapse and kill Lilli, but Will saves her, while one of the outcasts, Gilbert, is buried alive. Despite the initial mutual antagonism, Lilli warms up to Will after learning that he lost his family due to his refusal to fight for the Crusaders. The next day, Claudia tries to kill Lilli again by magically knocking down trees, but the latter manages to escape, although another outcast, Lars, is killed in the process. That night, Lilli and Will share their first kiss. Meanwhile, Claudia rapes Frederick to take his seed for the ritual resurrection of their stillborn child and turns Gustav's eviscerated heart into an apple. Disguised as an old crone, Claudia tracks down Lilli's whereabouts and tricks her into eating the apple, which plunges the latter into a death-like trance. Peter arrives shortly after and pronounces Lilli dead, but as the outcasts prepare to bury her, Will notices that Lilli's eyes have opened; he shakes her, which dislodges a piece of apple from Lilli's throat and revives her. Together with Will and Peter, Lilli returns to her castle and discovers that the entire household is under a spell that has driven them into a mindless and hostile state. Claudia forcibly takes Frederick to the chapel, where she begins to exsanguinate him to complete the ritual. Lilli and Will find a weakened Frederick and take him to safety, while Claudia kills Peter by pushing him out of the window. Lilli finds Claudia cradling her revived child and fights her, setting fire to the room in the ensuing battle. Lilli stabs the mirror with a dagger, wounding Claudia, who is further injured by the shards and the spreading fire, before she and her child are crushed to death by debris. With Claudia gone, her spells are broken, and Lilli reunites with her father and Will outside the castle.",

Thunder god Raiden and Earthrealm warriors Liu Kang, Sonya Blade, and Johnny Cage try to defend themselves, but Kahn kills Cage. The Earthrealm warriors retreat to seek allies. Sonya Blade enlists the help of her Special Forces partner, Jax, while Kitana and Liu search for a Native American shaman named Nightwolf, who seemingly knows the key to defeating Kahn. Scorpion appears and kidnaps Kitana. Raiden meets with the Elder Gods and asks them why Kahn was allowed to break the tournament rules and force his way into Earthrealm, and how he can be stopped. One says that reuniting Kitana with her mother, Sindel, is the key to breaking Kahn's hold on Earthrealm, but another Elder God insists that the defeat of Kahn himself is the solution. Raiden is then asked by the Elder Gods about his feelings and obligations towards the mortals, and what he would be willing to do to ensure their survival. Liu finds Nightwolf, who teaches him about the power of the Animality, a form of shapeshifting which utilizes the caster's strengths and abilities. To achieve the mindset needed to acquire this power, Liu must pass three tests. The first is a trial of his self-esteem, courage, and focus. The second comes in the form of temptation, which manifests itself in the form of Jade, a mysterious warrior who attempts to seduce Liu and offers her assistance after he resists her advances. Liu accepts Jade's offer and takes her with him to the Elder Gods' temple, where he and his friends meet with Raiden. The third test is never revealed. The Earthrealm warriors learn that Raiden has sacrificed his immortality to freely fight alongside them. Together, they infiltrate Outworld to rescue Kitana and reunite her with Sindel in hopes of restoring her soul and closing the Outworld portal to Earth. Liu rescues Kitana while the others incapacitate Sindel. However, Sindel remains under Kahn's control and escapes during an ambush. Jade reveals herself to be a double agent sent by Kahn to disrupt the heroes' plans. Kahn feeds Jade to a gargoyle for her failure. Raiden reveals that Shao Kahn is his brother and that the former Elder God Shinnok is their father. He realizes that Shinnok is supporting Kahn. Raiden and the Earthrealm warriors make their way to Kahn, Sindel, and his remaining generals. Shinnok demands that Raiden submit to him and restore their broken family, at the expense of his mortal friends. Raiden refuses and is killed by an energy blast from Shao Kahn. Jax, Sonya, and Kitana emerge victorious over Kahn's generals (with Jax defeating Motaro, Kitana defeating her mother, and Sonya defeating Ermac). Liu struggles with Kahn. Liu's Animality proves effective, exposing a cut to Kahn that proves he is now mortal, as a consequence of his breaking the sacred rules. Shinnok attempts to intervene and kill Liu on Kahn's behalf, but two of the Elder Gods arrive, having uncovered Shinnok's treachery. They declare that the fate of Earth shall be decided in Mortal Kombat. Liu defeats Kahn, and Shinnok is banished to the Netherrealm. Earthrealm is instantly reverted to its former state. With Kahn's hold over Sindel broken, she reunites with Kitana. Raiden is revived by the Elder Gods, who bestow upon him his father's former position.

After a sword duel, Connor beheads Fasil and absorbs a powerful release of energy from his body, then hides his sword in the garage's ceiling. NYPD officers detain him on suspicion of murder but lack evidence to hold him. Connor's history is revealed through a series of flashbacks. In the Scottish Highlands in 1536, Connor fights against the rival Fraser clan as a warrior of the MacLeod clan. The Frasers are aided by an outlander knight in exchange for his right to slay Connor. In battle the knight fatally stabs Connor but is driven off by his clansmen. After Connor makes a complete recovery, his lover Kate and his cousin Dougal accuse him of witchcraft. The clan wishes to kill him, but his other cousin, chieftain Angus, mercifully exiles him. Connor quietly settles into a new life as a blacksmith and marries a woman named Heather MacDonald. Juan Sánchez-Villalobos Ramírez, a swordsman from Spain, seeks out Connor. He explains that they and others like them are immortals. They possess a sixth sense known as the \"quickening\" and can be killed only by beheading. Each immortal must be ready to do battle with others, save on holy ground. Ramírez trains Connor in sword fighting and the two become friends. He tells Connor that as the number of immortals wanes, they will gather in a distant land for a final confrontation, until only one remains with the combined quickening of all. Immortals cannot conceive children, and Ramírez urges Connor to leave Heather so that he will be unburdened in the fight ahead. The knight that he encountered, the Kurgan, is a powerful and vicious immortal who would subject humanity to an eternity of darkness. One night while Connor is away, the Kurgan finds his home and duels Ramírez before decapitating him and leaving. Connor remains with Heather until she dies of old age, leaving him heartbroken. He wanders the earth, adopting Ramírez's katana as his own. In 1985, the Gathering approaches and the Kurgan comes to New York, where Connor deals antiques under the alias \"Russell Nash\" assisted by his confidant and adopted daughter Rachel Ellenstein. Brenda Wyatt, a metallurgy expert working for the police as a forensic scientist, finds shards of Connor's sword at Fasil's death scene and is puzzled that the swordsmithing techniques do not match the age of the blade. She follows Connor for clues and witnesses the Kurgan attack him. The police arrive, forcing them to flee. She meets with Connor twice afterward, hoping to learn about the paradoxical sword. Connor likes her but tells her to leave him alone. The Kurgan duels and beheads Sunda Kastagir, another immortal. A witness to the fight gives the NYPD a description of him. Brenda investigates Connor and finds evidence that he has lived for centuries. On Heather's birthday, Connor lights a candle for her in a church as he has done every year. The Kurgan arrives and confirms that he and Connor are now the last remaining immortals, and also reveals he raped Heather after killing Ramírez. Disgusted, but prohibited from fighting on holy ground, Connor leaves. Brenda confronts Connor, who explains his true identity. After spending the night together they part company, but the Kurgan finds out about their newfound intimacy and kidnaps Brenda to draw Connor out. Connor decides to leave behind the Russell Nash identity, says goodbye to Rachel and confronts the Kurgan at Silvercup Studios in Queens, rescuing Brenda in the process. After a long duel, Connor outfights and decapitates the Kurgan, absorbing his power. Connor returns to Scotland with Brenda and reveals that he is now a mortal man who can age and have children. He is also able to read the thoughts and feelings of people all around the world, and remembering Ramírez's lessons, he hopes to encourage co-operation, understanding, and peace among humanity.",

His ex-wife Erica is sympathetic to his situation, but considers him a bad example to their ten-year-old son Nick, an elementary schooler who considers quitting ice hockey and plans to become a bond trader like Erica's fiancé Don when he grows up. This makes Larry worry that Nick admires Don instead of him, especially after Nick decides to invite Don to Career Day at his school. Cecil Fredericks, an elderly night security guard about to retire from the Museum of Natural History, hires Larry despite his unpromising resume. The museum, which is rapidly losing money, plans to replace Cecil and his colleagues, Reginald and Gus, with one guard. Before his first night on the job, Cecil gives Larry an instruction manual on his job duties and warns him to \"not let anything in... or out.\" On his first night, Larry discovers that the museum's exhibits come to life after sunset, including: \"Rexy\", a Tyrannosaurus skeleton that behaves like a playful dog; Dexter, a mischievous stuffed capuchin monkey who destroys Larry's manual, along with other taxidermied animals, and later takes his keys; rival miniature civilizations depicting the American Frontier, Ancient Rome, and Ancient Maya; a chewing gum-loving Easter Island Moai who calls Larry \"Dum-Dum\"; American Civil War soldier mannequins; and wax models of Attila the Hun and some of his men, pyromaniacal Neanderthals, and Sacagawea, who is encased in glass and cannot hear anything. A horse-mounted Theodore Roosevelt rescues Larry from feuding miniature leaders Jedediah and Octavius, and explains that ever since an ancient Egyptian artifact—the Golden Tablet of Pharaoh Ahkmenrah—arrived in 1952, the exhibits come to life each night, but will turn to dust if left outside the museum at sunrise. As Theodore helps restore order, Larry learns that Theodore is in love with Sacagawea but is too shy to speak to her. Cecil, Reginald, and Gus check on Larry, who has decided to quit, but Nick and Don stop by to congratulate him on his new job. Larry decides to stay for Nick's sake, and Cecil advises reading up on history. Larry is better able to control the exhibits, but is forced to extinguish a fire that the Neanderthals' had caused in their own display, while Dexter steals Larry's keys again and unlocks a window. This allows a Neanderthal to jump out the window and escape onto the street, upon seeing a group of homeless people using a fire pit. Larry again decides to quit in frustration, and is unable to save the escaped Neanderthal from disintegrating from the rising sun, while his remains are swept up by a street sweeper. Nick witnesses museum director Dr. McPhee firing Larry over the damaged Neanderthal exhibit, though Larry convinces McPhee to reconsider. McPhee gives him one last chance to prove himself and Larry clears up the misunderstanding with Nick. Rebecca Hutman, a museum guide and historian writing her dissertation on Sacagawea, believes Larry is mocking her when he tells her the museum's nighttime secret. Larry brings Nick to the museum, intending to show him the T-rex coming to life, but nothing comes to life. They discover Cecil, Gus and Reginald stealing the tablet and have deactivated it to stop the exhibits from interfering. Like the exhibits, the elderly guards receive enhanced vitality from the tablet, and have plotted to steal it along with other valuable artifacts to fund their retirement and frame Larry for their thievery. Nick reactivates the tablet, bringing the museum back to life and a chase ensues throughout the museum, but the chase is halted when Cecil snatches the tablet away and locks Nick and Larry in the Egyptian room. Larry releases Ahkmenrah's mummy from his sarcophagus, and the pharaoh, who removes his cloth wraps to reveal himself as a fully living human, helps Larry and Nick escape. They find the other exhibits fighting amongst themselves, and Larry convinces them to unite to catch the guards and recover the tablet. Gus and Reginald are captured, while Cecil escapes in a Pony Express stagecoach. Theodore pushes Sacagawea out of Cecil's path and is sliced in half but survives, being \"made of wax.\" Larry pursues Cecil into Central Park, stopping him and regaining the tablet. Theodore bonds with Sacagawea as she repairs him with hot wax. Rebecca sees the exhibits returning to the museum. She realizes that Larry was telling the truth, and he later introduces her to Sacagawea. Theodore remarks that he is proud of Larry's work along with Nick. Larry laments that he was not able to save everyone, believing that Jedediah and Octavius were both killed after the latter crashed his radio-controlled car, and is surprised when they return alive and well. The next day, McPhee attempts to fire Larry after news reports about the night's strange events—such as The Neanderthals leaving cave paintings in the museum's subway station, and Rexy's dinosaur tracks in Central Park—but the publicity boosts museum attendance. Larry is rehired, goes to Nick's school's next career day and celebrates that night with a party, with Nick, Rebecca and the exhibits in attendance. Cecil, Gus and Reginald, rather than being turned in to the police by Larry, are forced to work as museum janitors as punishment for their crimes, and they clean up after the party.",

    "title": "Donnie Darko",
    "plot": "On October 2, 1988, troubled teenager Donald \"Donnie\" Darko sleepwalks outside, led by a mysterious voice. Once outside, he meets a figure named Frank in a monstrous rabbit costume. Frank tells Donnie that the world will end in precisely 28 days. Donnie wakes up the next morning on a local golf course and returns home to discover a jet engine has crashed into his bedroom. His older sister Elizabeth tells him the FAA investigators do not know its origin. Over the next several days, Donnie continues to have visions of Frank, and his parents, Eddie and Rose, send him to psychotherapist Dr. Thurman. Thurman believes Donnie is detached from reality and that his visions of Frank are \"daylight hallucinations,\" symptomatic of paranoid schizophrenia. Frank asks Donnie if he believes in time travel, and Donnie in turn asks his science teacher, Dr. Kenneth Monnitoff. Monnitoff gives Donnie The Philosophy of Time Travel, a book written by Roberta Sparrow, a former science teacher at the school who is now a seemingly senile old woman living outside of town, known to the local teenagers as Grandma Death. Frank begins to influence Donnie's actions through his sleepwalking episodes, including causing him to flood his high school by breaking a water main, to which Donnie almost gets caught. Donnie later starts dating Gretchen Ross, who has recently moved into town with her mother under a new identity to escape her violent stepfather. Gym teacher Kitty Farmer begins teaching \"attitude lessons\" taken from local motivational speaker Jim Cunningham, but Donnie rebels against these, leading to friction between Kitty and Rose. Kitty arranges for Cunningham to speak at a school assembly, where Donnie insults him. He later finds Cunningham's wallet and address. Gretchen and Donnie go on a movie theater date, where Gretchen falls asleep and Frank reveals himself to be a teenager with his right eye hollow and bleeding. Frank then convinces Donnie to burn down Cunningham's house, which he does while Gretchen is at the theatre. Firefighters discover a hoard of child pornography at the burned remains. Cunningham is arrested, and Kitty, who wishes to testify in his defense, asks Rose to replace her as chaperone for their daughters' dance troupe on its trip to Los Angeles. With Rose in Los Angeles and Eddie away for business, Donnie and Elizabeth hold a Halloween costume party to celebrate Elizabeth's acceptance to Harvard. At the party, Gretchen arrives distraught as her mother has gone missing, and she and Donnie have sex for the first time. When Donnie realizes that Frank's prophesied end of the world is only hours away, he takes Gretchen and two other friends to see Sparrow. Instead of Sparrow, they find two high school bullies, Seth and Ricky, who are trying to rob Sparrow's home. Donnie, Seth, and Ricky fight in the road in front of her house just as Sparrow returns home. The bullies and Donnie's two friends leave when an oncoming car runs over Gretchen, killing her. The driver turns out to be Elizabeth's boyfriend, Frank Anderson, wearing the same rabbit costume from Donnie's visions. Angered, and realizing what's happening, Donnie shoots Frank in the right eye with his father's gun and walks home carrying Gretchen's body. Donnie returns home in the morning as a vortex forms over his house. He borrows one of his parents' cars, loads Gretchen's body into it, and drives to a nearby ridge that overlooks the town. There, he watches as the plane carrying Rose and the dance troupe home from Los Angeles gets caught in the vortex's wake, violently ripping off one of its engines and sending it back in time. Events of the previous 28 days unwind. Donnie wakes up in his bedroom, recognizes the date is October 2, and laughs as the jet engine falls into his bedroom, killing him. Around town, those whose lives Donnie would have touched wake up from troubled dreams. Gretchen rides by the Darko home the following day and learns of Donnie's death. Gretchen asks the neighbor, \"What was his name?\" Gretchen and Rose exchange glances and wave as if they know each other but cannot remember from where.",

    "title": "Puss in Boots",
    "plot": "Puss in Boots is a Spanish-speaking anthropomorphic cat, named for his signature pair of boots. A fugitive on the run from the law, Puss is seeking to restore his lost honor. One night, he learns that the murderous outlaw couple Jack and Jill have the magic beans he has long sought, which can lead him to a giant's castle known by legend to contain valuable golden goose eggs. When Puss attempts to steal the beans at their hideout, a female cat named Kitty Softpaws interrupts. She was hired to steal them as well by Humpty Alexander Dumpty, a talking egg and Puss' long-estranged childhood friend from the orphanage in San Ricardo, where they both were raised. Puss tells Kitty his origin story; he has been on the run from the law ever since Humpty tricked him into assisting in what turned out to be a failed bank robbery when they were teenagers. Humpty eventually persuades Puss to join them in finding the beans and retrieving the golden eggs. Puss and Kitty's relationship turns romantic and, despite Puss's initial grudge against Humpty, he slowly warms up to him. The trio steals the beans from Jack and Jill and plants them in the desert. They ride the beanstalk into the clouds, talking in a high-pitched voice due to the thin air and enter the giant's castle, where Humpty reveals to Puss that the giant died a long time ago, but they manage to avoid the \"Great Terror\" who guards the Golden Goose and the golden eggs. They soon realize the golden eggs are too heavy and decide to steal the Golden Goose after witnessing it lay miniature golden eggs. They manage to escape the castle and cut down the beanstalk. After celebrating, the group is ambushed by Jack and Jill, and Puss is knocked unconscious. When he wakes, Puss assumes Humpty and Kitty were kidnapped and tracks Jack and Jill's wagon back to San Ricardo, where he learns that the kidnapping was staged. Jack, Jill, and Kitty are all working for Humpty, who is seeking revenge against Puss for abandoning him to be arrested during the failed bank robbery. Puss is surrounded by the town's militia and turns himself in following pleas from his adoptive mother, Imelda. As Puss is hauled away to prison, Humpty is celebrated as a hero for bringing the wealth of golden eggs to the townspeople. In prison, Puss meets Andy \"Jack\" Beanstalk, who reveals that Humpty stole the beans from him when they shared a cell years ago. Jack warns Puss that the Great Terror is the Golden Goose's mother, a gigantic bird who will stop at nothing to rescue her baby. Puss realizes that luring the Great Terror to destroy San Ricardo was Humpty's intention all along, as he held a grudge against the town for imprisoning him. Kitty frees Puss from prison and apologizes, revealing her feelings for him. Puss locates Humpty in time and convinces him to redeem himself by helping to save San Ricardo from destruction. Using the gosling as bait, Puss and Humpty are able to lure the Great Terror away from town; with Kitty's help, they also thwart Jack and Jill's attempts to steal the gosling during the chase. As the group reaches the outskirts of town, Humpty and the gosling are knocked off a collapsing bridge, but manage to hang onto a rope that Puss grabs. When it becomes evident that Puss cannot save them both, Humpty sacrifices himself by letting go. After a fatal impact, Puss discovers that Humpty has a large golden egg underneath his shell. The Great Terror is reunited with her gosling, and she takes Humpty's golden egg and returns to her home in the clouds. Despite being hailed a hero by the townspeople for saving San Ricardo, Puss is still a fugitive in the eyes of the militia. He reunites with Imelda, who expresses her pride and love for Puss before he flees with Kitty, who playfully steals his boots. In the epilogue, Jack and Jill are recovering from their injuries, a restored Humpty is seen wearing a golden egg costume and dancing on the Great Terror’s back with her gosling, and Puss and Kitty share a kiss.",

    "plot": "In Japan in 1617, assassins led by Bi-Han assault the estate of Hanzo Hasashi's clan and murder everyone, including Hanzo's family. After killing the attackers, Hanzo fights Bi-Han but succumbs to his wounds and dies, his soul condemned to the Netherrealm. Raiden, god of Thunder, later takes Hanzo's surviving infant daughter to safety. In 2021, the realm of Outworld has defeated Earthrealm in nine tournaments known as \"Mortal Kombat\". The rules state that if Earthrealm loses a tenth one, it will be conquered by Outworld. An ancient prophecy states that the \"blood of Hanzo Hasashi\" will unite a new generation of Earthrealm's champions to prevent Outworld's victory. Sorcerer and Outworlder Shang Tsung sends his warriors to preemptively eliminate Earthrealm's champions, identified by a dragon mark, before the tenth tournament begins. MMA fighter Cole Young and his family are attacked by Bi-Han, who now calls himself Sub-Zero. Special Forces Major Jackson \"Jax\" Briggs rescues the Youngs, directing them to find his partner, Sonya Blade. Jax stays to battle Sub-Zero but loses his arms in the process. Cole goes to Sonya's hideout, where she is interrogating a captive Australian mercenary named Kano. Jax and Sonya have been investigating Mortal Kombat's existence. They are attacked by Shang Tsung's assassin, Syzoth, who Kano kills with Cole and Sonya's help. They travel to Raiden's temple and meet Earthrealm champions Liu Kang and Kung Lao and Raiden himself, who is critical of the newcomers. They also find Jax, whom Raiden rescued and fitted with a set of mechanical arms. Shang Tsung attempts to attack the temple but is stopped when Raiden shields it from intrusion. Cole and Kano train with Liu Kang and Kung Lao to unlock their \"arcana\", a power unique to all dragon mark bearers. During an argument, Kano awakens his arcana, granting him the ability to shoot lasers from his scarred eye, much to his delight. Meanwhile, Cole is unable to awaken his arcana. Disappointed, Raiden sends Cole back to his family, revealing that he is a descendant of Hasashi. Shang Tsung gathers his warriors, including Kano's former ally, Kabal, to attack the temple. Kabal convinces Kano to defect and sabotage the shield. During the fray, Jax awakens his arcana, granting him superhuman strength and upgraded arms. Concurrently, the Youngs are attacked by Goro. Cole rouses his arcana, gaining a suit of armor that can absorb kinetic energy from physical attacks and a set of tonfas, and kills Goro before helping repel the attack on the temple. As Raiden teleports the Earthrealm fighters to the Void, a safe space between realms, Sub-Zero attempts to stop Cole. However, Kung Lao saves Cole from Sub-Zero and has his soul taken by Shang Tsung. Cole proposes a plan to force Outworld's champions into single combat with them before neutralizing Sub-Zero together. Agreeing with the plan, Raiden gives Cole Hanzo's kunai, which still has Hanzo's blood on it. Raiden transports Cole and his allies to their targets. While defeating Outworld's champions, Sonya kills Kano and acquires his dragon mark, gaining the ability to fire energy blasts from her arms. Sub-Zero abducts Cole's family to lure him into a one-on-one fight. Overpowered, Cole uses the kunai and drains the blood from it, releasing Hanzo as the vengeful specter, Scorpion. Recognizing Cole as his descendant, Scorpion helps him kill Sub-Zero and free his family. Thanking Cole for freeing him and requesting that he take care of the Hasashi bloodline, Scorpion departs as Raiden, the other champions, and Shang Tsung arrive. Shang Tsung threatens to bring armies instead of individual fighters next time they meet. Raiden banishes him, declaring his intention to train new warriors for the next tournament and assigning his current champions to recruit them. Cole then departs to Los Angeles to search for martial arts movie star Johnny Cage.",

    "plot": "On the day before Halloween, young Dustin James \"D.J.\" Walters spies on his elderly neighbor, Horace Nebbercracker, who has been scaring children off his property and stealing their belongings. D.J.'s parents leave town for a convention, placing him in the care of his teenage babysitter Elizabeth, or Zee. Later, D.J.'s best friend Charles \"Chowder\" Peterson loses his basketball on Nebbercracker's front yard and D.J. attempts to retrieve it. Nebbercracker furiously confronts D.J., but appears to suffer a heart attack and is taken away by paramedics, leading the boys to believe he is dead. When Zee's boyfriend Bones visits, he recalls Nebbercracker's theft of his kite and relates rumors of him cannibalizing his late wife. After Zee kicks Bones out for being too rough, he sees his kite in the front door of Nebbercracker's house and reclaims it, only to be sucked inside. D.J. and Chowder later investigate and discover that the house is seemingly possessed by Nebbercracker's vengeful spirit. The next morning, the duo save a girl scout Jennifer \"Jenny\" Bennett from the house as she sells candy. Jenny calls police officers Landers and Lister, but the house cunningly stays inactive when the officers arrive and they dismiss the report. The kids consult local supernatural expert Reginald \"Skull\" Skulinski, who speculates that the house is a rare supernatural creature that can only be vanquished when its heart is struck. Deducing that its furnace is the heart, the kids construct a dummy filled with cold medicine and offer it to the house to eat, hoping to put it to sleep. However, Landers and Lister disrupt the plan, and the house devours them all. The children explore the now-asleep house and discover a shrine to Nebbercracker's wife, Constance, whose skeletal remains are entombed in cement. The house awakens, but Jenny grabs its chandelier-like uvula and forces the house to vomit them back outside. Nebbercracker returns from the hospital, alive, revealing that Constance is the house. He explains that when they first met, Constance was an unwilling participant in a circus freak show. Nebbercracker helped her escape, married her and began constructing a house for them. On Halloween, children began harassing Constance, causing her to fall into the basement, where she was suffocated by a concrete mixer inadvertently activated in the chaos. Upon the house's completion, Constance's vengeful spirit merged with it, forcing her husband to frighten children away for their own protection. D.J. tells Nebbercracker that they must put Constance to rest. Overhearing this, Constance uses a pair of trees to lift the house from its foundation and pursues her husband and the kids. They lure Constance to a nearby construction site, where Chowder fights Constance with an excavator. D.J. tosses some dynamite into the chimney, destroying the house. Constance's spirit reunites with Nebbercracker before finally ascending to the afterlife, finally out of her misery. Nebbercracker and the kids return everything the former stole to their rightful owners and D.J. and Chowder decide to go trick-or-treating, which D.J. previously felt they were too old for. Meanwhile, all of the house's victims emerge from the basement unscathed.",

    "title": "Haunted",
    "plot": "In 1928 England, English professor David Ash has spent most of his life working in the field of parapsychology to disprove the existence of ghosts. David was motivated by the death of Juliet, his twin sister, when they were 11, for which he blames himself. After Juliet's death, David and his mother went to live in America. David attends a séance, where he exposes the medium's tricks, revealing her hidden accomplices. He is then shocked to hear her call out his name in a voice that sounds like Juliet's. As a professor at Oxford, he receives a series of urgent entreaties from a Miss Webb, who claims she is being tormented by ghosts, to come and help her. The name of the house is Edbrook. David travels to Sussex and is picked up at the railway station by Christina Mariell. Christina reveals Miss Webb is in fact their Nanny Tess, and that she wrote to David at the urging of the Mariell siblings, Christina, Robert and Simon. The siblings are concerned for her mental health and believe her belief in ghosts is due to her senility. She drives David to the palatial Edbrook House, where Christina's two brothers and the withdrawn Nanny Tess live. David begins to perform forensic examinations of the house, trying to detect evidence of paranormal activity. Complicating the investigation is Christina's continuous flirtation with David, and his own infatuation with her. However, older brother Robert is against their friendship, and the two have a suspiciously close relationship. David begins having paranormal experiences. Christina, who had originally told David both her parents died in India, admits that in fact her mother drowned herself in the lake and Nanny Tess was the one who discovered the body. David believes it is the trauma of this which is causing Nanny Tess to see the ghost of Mrs. Mariell. David then decides to leave Edbrook and asks Christina to come away with him. Although she refuses, they kiss and end up in making love in her bed. In the morning, when David wakes, the wind is gusting through the house, which is now cloaked in black drapes and littered with fallen leaves. He searches for Christina but instead sees the ghost of Juliet, who leads David to a cemetery. Juliet calls his attention to a tombstone which states that Robert, Christina and Simon Mariell all died in a fire at Edbrook House in 1923. A confused David seeks out Dr. Doyle, the family doctor, whom he had met earlier, only to be told by Juliet's ghost that Doyle also had died years ago. Despite Juliet's warning, David leaves with Christina, who has appeared in her car. On the drive home, he sees Juliet in the middle of the road and wrenches the wheel to avoid her. The car crashes into a tree and explodes, killing Christina. David escapes, returns to the house and confronts Nanny Tess. She confirms that the Mariell siblings are dead and that their ghosts will do anything to keep her and David from leaving. The reason Mrs. Mariell drowned herself was because she discovered drunken Simon and Robert in their parents' bed having incestuous sex with Christina. The siblings appear and force Nanny Tess to confess to their murder (she had locked them in a bedroom and then set fire to the house). With David as the new victim of their torments, the siblings no longer need Nanny Tess. They kill her, and Christina asks David to die for them. He tries to escape but is blocked by the three siblings and Dr. Doyle. They set the mansion ablaze, but he escapes to the upstairs bedroom. While Robert, Simon and Christina cackle within the flames at his imminent death, Juliet appears and walks through the flames, takes David by the hand and rescues him. As they walk away from the mansion's ruins, Juliet absolves him of his guilt over her death and departs to the afterlife. David then returns home and is greeted by his assistant, Kate, as he steps off the train. Behind the unsuspecting couple, Christina moves out of the shadows and follows them through the fog as they leave the platform.",

    "plot": "A selfish and unkind prince hosting a ball is visited in his castle by an enchantress disguised as an old beggar woman, who offers him an enchanted rose in exchange for shelter from a storm. When he rebuffs her, she reveals her true form and transforms him into a beast and his servants into household objects before erasing them from the memories of their loved ones. For the curse to be broken, the prince must learn to love someone and have that person love him back before the rose sheds its last petal, or else he will remain a beast forever. Several years later in a nearby village, Belle, the bookworm daughter of widowed artist Maurice, dreams of adventure while constantly rejecting advances from Gaston, an arrogant hunter and war veteran. One day, Maurice becomes lost in the forest and — after escaping a pack of wolves — seeks refuge in the Beast's castle. The Beast imprisons him after he catches him stealing a rose from the garden for Belle. Belle travels to the castle and offers to take her father's place as prisoner; the Beast agrees. Belle meets the castle's servants, including candelabra Lumière, mantel clock Cogsworth, feather-duster Plumette, teapot Mrs. Potts, and her son Chip, a teacup. When she finds the rose, the Beast angrily forces her to flee outside. Belle is ambushed by wolves and the Beast rescues her, getting injured in the process. As she nurses his wounds, they bond. He shows her a gift from the enchantress, a book that transports readers to their desired location. She and the Beast visit her childhood home in Paris, where they discover a plague doctor's mask and Belle realizes that when she was an infant, she forcibly departed with Maurice after her mother's death from the bubonic plague, the one thing Maurice could not bring himself to reveal. Meanwhile, Maurice fails to convince the other villagers of the Beast. Gaston agrees to help, seeing rescuing Belle as the perfect opportunity to win her hand in marriage. When Maurice discovers his ulterior motive, Gaston abandons him to be devoured by wolves. Maurice is rescued by the town hermit Agathe, but Gaston convinces the village to send Maurice to an insane asylum. Belle discovers Maurice's predicament via a magic mirror, another gift from the enchantress. The Beast releases her to save him. Arriving back in town, she reveals the Beast via the mirror, shocking the townsfolk and proving her father's sanity. Realizing Belle has fallen for the Beast, Gaston jealously has her thrown into the asylum carriage with Maurice, then rallies the villagers to slay the Beast. Belle tells Maurice about her mother's death, and the two escape. Gaston attacks the depressed Beast, who regains his spirit upon seeing Belle return. He spares Gaston's life, but Gaston shoots the Beast twice from an unstable bridge; its collapse sends Gaston falling to his death. The Beast dies just as the last petal falls, and the servants become inanimate. As Belle tearfully professes her love to him, Agathe reveals herself as the enchantress and undoes the curse, restoring the Beast and his servants to their human forms along with the villagers' memories, as well as restoring the castle to its true appearance.

    "plot": "In 1926, British wizard and \"magizoologist\" Newt Scamander arrives in New York City. He observes Mary Lou Barebone, the non-magical (\"No-Maj\" or \"Muggle\") head of the New Salem Philanthropic Society, preaching that witches and wizards are real and dangerous. Attempting to recapture a Niffler that escapes from his suitcase of magical creatures, Newt bumps into No-Maj Jacob Kowalski, an aspiring baker, and unwittingly swaps suitcases. Porpentina \"Tina\" Goldstein, a demoted Auror of the Magical Congress of the United States (MACUSA), spots the Niffler and arrests Newt for breaking magical law. Since the suitcase Newt holds contains only Jacob's baked goods, he is released. At home, Jacob opens Newt's suitcase, inadvertently freeing several creatures into the city, and is bitten by one. Tina and Newt follow a trail of wreckage and track down an ill Jacob and the case. To cure Jacob, Tina takes them both to her apartment and introduces them to Queenie, her Legilimens sister. Jacob and Queenie are mutually attracted, though it is illegal for wizard-kind to have any social relationship with No-Majs in America. To cure Jacob, Newt takes him inside his magically expanded suitcase, which houses various creatures, including an Obscurial of a deceased girl, a parasite that develops inside magically gifted children when their abilities are suppressed; those afflicted rarely live past the age of 10. After Newt and Jacob recapture two of the four escaped beasts, Tina grabs and returns the suitcase to MACUSA, but all three are arrested. Officials believe the Obscurial in Newt's case is responsible for the spate of destruction, including the killing of Senator Henry Shaw Jr., when instead the destruction was caused by a second Obscurial already in the city. The Director of Magical Security, Percival Graves, accuses Newt of conspiring with the infamous dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald, and decides to destroy Newt's case and its contents, and obliviate Jacob's recent memories. Newt and Tina are sentenced to death. Upon sensing this, Queenie rescues Jacob and helps Newt and Tina escape and retrieve the case before the sentences can be carried out. Later, in a speakeasy dive bar, a tip from Tina's goblin informant Gnarlak leads the four to recapture the last two escaped creatures. Graves approaches Credence, Mary Lou's adult adopted son, offering to free him from his abusive mother in exchange for helping to find the destructive Obscurial. Credence finds a wand under his younger adopted sister Modesty's bed. Mary Lou assumes it is his, but just as Credence is to be punished, the Obscurial kills Mary Lou and her elder adopted daughter, Chastity. Assuming Modesty is the Obscurial's host, Graves dismisses Credence as a squib reneging on his promise to teach him magic in return for service. Credence reveals he is the real host, having survived to maturity due to the intensity of his magic, and openly attacks the city. Newt finds Credence hiding in a subway tunnel and tries to persuade him to come with him, but Graves attacks him. Tina, who had tried to protect Credence from Mary Lou (which action had led to her demotion), attempts to calm the boy, while Graves tries to convince Credence to join him. As Credence returns to human form, MACUSA President Seraphina Picquery and the Aurors enter to counterattack, shattering the Obscurial. Newt is the only one who sees a single wisp of the creature fleeing the wreckage. Graves claims MACUSA's laws openly protect No-Majs at the expense of the magical community, and declares that he no longer cares to live in hiding. He confesses his plan to unleash the Obscurial and expose the magical community to No-Majs and frame Newt with his case of creatures for this. Picquery orders the Aurors to apprehend Graves, but he defeats them. Newt captures him with the help of one of his beasts and unmasks Graves as the disguised Grindelwald. Picquery fears that the destruction to the city is too extensive to keep their world secret. But Newt releases his Thunderbird to disperse an extract that wipes recent bad memories across the city in the rain. During this, MACUSA wizards, who are immune to the extract, repair the destruction and erase all traces of their existence. Queenie kisses Jacob goodbye as the rain erases his memories.

    "plot": "In a flashback, an infant Branch and his four older brothers John Dory, Spruce, Clay, and Floyd perform as a boyband called BroZone. When they failed to perform the \"Perfect Family Harmony\", a powerful ability that Trolls can achieve when they are in complete sync, the brothers argue and go their separate ways. Branch is left alone to be raised by his grandmother Rosiepuff. In the present, leaving off a month after saving music from the Hard Rock Trolls, Branch and Poppy attend Bridget and Gristle's wedding in Bergen Town. They are interrupted by John Dory, who reveals to Branch that Floyd has been captured by Velvet and Veneer, two Mount Rageon teenagers who wish to be pop stars. The siblings have trapped Floyd in a diamond perfume bottle, which they use to extract his essence and improve their singing, although the process could eventually kill him. As the Perfect Family Harmony is the only thing that can destroy diamond, Branch reluctantly agrees to help John Dory find their brothers and rescue Floyd. Along with Poppy and Tiny Diamond, they set out in Rhonda, John Dory's armadillo-like portable van. They find Spruce at the Vacay Island resort, where he has changed his name to Bruce and started a family. Bruce is reluctant to help, until his wife and kids convince him to do so. The group later finds Clay at an abandoned Bergen miniature golf course, inhabited by a hidden colony of Pop Trolls who do not know that the Bergens are no longer their enemies, having been separated from the other Pop Trolls when they fled the final Trollstice. They also meet the colony's leader, Viva, who reveals herself to be Poppy's long-lost sister. At first, Poppy is delighted, but the visit turns sour when Viva refuses to believe the Bergens have changed, and tries to stop Poppy's group from leaving the golf course. They manage to escape thanks to Clay, who has agreed to help, and Poppy and Viva sadly part ways. Meanwhile, Velvet and Veneer continue to strip Floyd of his essence, and Velvet reveals that she forged Floyd's handwriting and sent a letter to John Dory, in order to bait Floyd's brothers to come and rescue him. Furthermore, the siblings' assistant Crimp invents shoulder-pad suits that enhance the extraction, which they plan to use when they capture all of BroZone. The Trolls almost made it to Mount Rageous, but once again argue and fail to perform the Perfect Family Harmony. When his brothers decide they will split up again after saving Floyd, Branch scolds them for still treating him like a baby, revealing to them that he lived his whole life alone after their grandmother got eaten. Branch joins with Poppy and Tiny and takes them to Mount Rageous on their own and they locate Floyd, but Velvet and Veneer capture the rest of Branch's brothers, much to his horror. The trio escape and free Rhonda who is also captured but meet Crimp, who gives Poppy a hug. Meanwhile, Bridget and Gristle eventually stumble into the golf course during their honeymoon but Viva notices them and agrees to help them find Poppy after realizing her mistake. With the aid of their new friends, Branch and Poppy confront Velvet and Veneer when they start mingling with their fans, prompting them to drive away in their luxury vehicle in which Branch, Poppy, and Tiny pursue in Rhonda. During the ensuing chase, Velvet and Veneer begin using the shoulder-pads to extract the essence from Branch's brothers in order to put on a show. Branch, Poppy and their friends are soon helped by Viva, Bridget, and Gristle, and they rescue Branch's brothers, except for Floyd. Seeing that Floyd is just about out of essence, Branch tells his brothers that they all simply need to be in harmony. They, along with Poppy and Viva, perform the Perfect Family Harmony and break free of their prisons just as Floyd loses the last of his essence, killing him, but he is quickly revived. Veneer, who had been second-guessing Velvet's machinations, publicly confesses everything, and the siblings are sent to prison as Branch and Poppy share their first kiss. The Trolls return to Vacay Island and witness BroZone's comeback concert, joined by Kismet, another band Branch was once part of.",

    "plot": "In Summerville, Oklahoma, Egon Spengler captures an entity in occultist Ivo Shandor's mine outside the town and lures another to his farm. He activates an elaborate setup on his property, but the power fails. Egon manages to conceal the ghost trap in his home before being attacked by the entity and suffering a fatal heart attack before the entity returns to the mine. His estranged and financially struggling daughter, Callie, inherits the farm and moves there with her children, Trevor and Phoebe, after being evicted from their Chicago apartment. Trevor becomes infatuated with carhop Lucky Domingo and the scientifically minded Phoebe enrolls in a summer science class taught by seismologist Gary Grooberson, whom Callie later dates. Phoebe discovers the farmhouse is haunted and the invisible ghost residing in it leads her to the ghost trap, which she shows to Gary and her new friend, \"Podcast\". Gary, a fan of the Ghostbusters, helps her learn more about them and her grandfather. He, Phoebe, and Podcast tamper with the trap, releasing Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer the Gozerian, which escapes to the mine. The farm ghost leads Phoebe to Egon's underground laboratory and, after revealing himself as her grandfather, guides her in restoring the Ghostbusters' equipment. While testing the proton pack with Podcast, Phoebe finds a ghost they call \"Muncher\" that haunts Shandor's foundry and flees to the town. Having repaired the Ghostbusters' Cadillac Ecto-1's engine (with Egon's help), Trevor uses the car to chase Muncher with the pair; they capture him but are arrested for the damage incurred and their equipment is seized. Using the Ghostbusters' telephone number that she had written down, Phoebe contacts Ray Stantz for help and informs him of Egon's death. In turn, Ray tells her what became of the Ghostbusters after they defeated Vigo the Carpathian: The team had disbanded following a downturn in business and Egon then stole all their equipment and moved to Summerville to pursue an unspecified threat. Shortly after, Gary is attacked and possessed by Vinz after returning the children home following a date with Callie. Egon's ghost leads Callie to a wall of detailed notes and pictures he kept of her life, showing he cared about her more than she thought, just before she becomes possessed by Zuul, Gatekeeper of Gozer. Phoebe, Podcast, Lucky, and Trevor find a Gozerian temple within the mine. Exploring further, they discover the long-dead Shandor beginning to revive in his casket as automated proton cannons, installed by Egon, hinder Gozer's attempts to cross over. Vinz sabotages the cannons and performs a mating rite with Zuul, allowing Gozer to escape and take physical form. Shandor awakens and pledges his fealty to Gozer, but she immediately murders him. The children discover Egon's \"farm\" is an array of ghost traps buried in a dirt field. As supernatural chaos rages through the town, they free Muncher and use him to recover the seized ghostbusting equipment and Ecto-1, then head to the mine. Phoebe distracts Gozer so Podcast can re-capture Zuul, freeing Callie and weakening Gozer's physical form. They lure Gozer and Vinz to the trap field, but it malfunctions as Zuul possesses Lucky when rescued, fully restoring Gozer's power. Ray, along with Peter Venkman and Winston Zeddemore, arrive to help as Gozer, having orchestrated Egon's death, seeks to resume avenging her previous defeat. Supported by Egon's now-manifested ghost, Phoebe uses his proton pack to battle Gozer. The Ghostbusters assist by crossing their packs' proton streams while Trevor uses his to charge the traps' power source, allowing Callie to activate them and capture the villains. Lucky and Gary are freed from their possessions and Egon reconciles with his family and friends before passing on to the afterlife. In a mid-credits scene, the original Ghostbusters return to New York City and Peter is revealed to be married to Dana Barrett. In a post-credits scene, Winston, having become a wealthy entrepreneur and family man since leaving the Ghostbusters, returns the fully restored Ecto-1 to the team's old firehouse headquarters. In the basement, a light on their old ghost containment system begins to flash red.",

    "title": "Groundhog Day",
    "plot": "On February 1, cynical television weatherman Phil Connors reassures his Pittsburgh viewers that an approaching blizzard will miss Western Pennsylvania. Alongside his new producer Rita Hanson and cameraman Larry, Phil travels to Punxsutawney for his annual coverage of the Groundhog Day festivities. He makes no secret of his contempt for the assignment, the small town, and the \"hicks\" who live there, asserting that he will soon be leaving his station for a new job. On February 2, Phil awakens in the Cherry Street Inn to Sonny & Cher's \"I Got You Babe\" playing on the clock radio. He gives a half-hearted report on the groundhog Punxsutawney Phil and the festivities. Contrary to his prediction, the blizzard strikes the area, preventing all travel out of Punxsutawney, and although he desperately searches for a way to leave, he is forced to spend the night in the town. The next morning, Phil wakes once more to \"I Got You Babe\" and the same DJ banter on the radio in his room at the Cherry Street Inn. Phil experiences the previous day's events repeating exactly and believes he is experiencing déjà vu. He again unsuccessfully attempts to leave the town and retires to bed. When he awakes, it is again February 2. Phil gradually realizes that he is trapped in a time loop of which no one else is aware. He confides his situation to Rita, who directs him to a neurologist, who in turn directs him to a psychologist; neither can explain his experiences. Phil gets drunk with locals Gus and Ralph and then leads police on a high-speed car chase before being arrested and imprisoned; the next morning, Phil awakens in the Cherry Street Inn once again. Realizing that there are no consequences for his actions, Phil begins to spend loops indulging in binge eating, one-night stands, robbery, and other dangerous activities, using his increasing knowledge of the day's events and the town's residents to manipulate circumstances to his advantage. Eventually, he focuses on seducing the sweet-natured Rita, using the loops to learn more about and manipulate her. No matter what steps he takes, Rita rebuffs his advances, particularly when Phil tells her he loves her; Rita asserts that he does not even know her. Phil gradually becomes depressed and desperate for a way to escape the loop. He commits suicide in a variety of ways, even kidnapping Punxsutawney Phil and driving them both off a cliff. Each time, he reawakens on February 2 to \"I Got You Babe\". He eventually tries to explain his situation to Rita again, using his detailed knowledge of the day to accurately predict events. Convinced, Rita spends the rest of that day's loop with Phil; she encourages him to think of the loops as a blessing instead of a curse. As they lie on the bed together at night, Phil realizes that his feelings for Rita have become sincere. He wakes alone on February 2. Phil decides to use his knowledge of the loop to change himself and others: he saves people from deadly accidents and misfortunes and learns to play the piano, sculpt ice, and speak French. Regardless of his positive actions, however, he is haunted by his inability to prevent a homeless old man from dying of natural causes. During one iteration of the loop, Phil reports on the Groundhog Day festivities with such eloquence that other news crews stop working to listen to his speech, amazing Rita. Phil continues his day helping the people of Punxsutawney. That night, Rita witnesses Phil's expert piano-playing as the adoring townsfolk regale her with stories of his good deeds earlier that day. Impressed by his apparent overnight transformation, Rita successfully bids for him at a charity bachelor auction. Phil carves an ice sculpture in Rita's image and tells her that no matter what happens, even if he is trapped in the loop forever, he is finally happy because he loves her. They share a kiss and retire to Phil's room. Phil wakes the next morning to \"I Got You Babe\", but finds Rita is still in bed with him and the radio banter has changed; it is now February 3. He tells Rita he wants to live in Punxsutawney with her.",

    "plot": "Sam Greenfield, an orphaned young woman with a life plagued by misfortune, is forced out from her foster home, much to the dismay of her younger friend and roommate Hazel, who is hoping to be adopted soon. One night, after sharing food with a black cat, Sam finds a penny she hopes to give to Hazel for her collection of lucky items that may help her get adopted. The next day, Sam notices that the penny has made her luck improve. However, she loses the penny by inadvertently flushing it down a toilet. While bemoaning her error, Sam encounters the cat again and says what happened, which causes the cat to berate her for losing the penny. Shocked that the cat could talk, Sam follows the cat through a portal to the Land of Luck, where creatures like leprechauns create good luck for the people on Earth. The cat, named Bob, needs the penny for traveling purposes and will be banished if word gets out that he lost it. Bob and Sam make a deal to get another penny from the Penny depot for Hazel to use before returning it to Bob. Bob uses a button from Sam to pass off as a penny while she sneaks into the Land of Luck using clothes belonging to Bob's personal leprechaun, Gerry. Throughout the journey, Sam comes to learn that bad luck is managed underneath the Land of Luck. Following a disaster at the Penny depot which causes Gerry to learn about Sam's identity, Gerry uses a drone to retrieve the missing penny on Earth. However, the drone gets lost in the In-Between, a space between the Good and Bad Luck lands. Sam and Bob go to the In-Between, which is managed by a unicorn named Jeff. Jeff manages the Bad Luck Apparat, a machine that keeps bad luck specks from sticking which feeds the Randomizer, another machine that sends both good and bad luck into Earth. Jeff reveals that he found the penny and has returned it to the depot. Undeterred, Sam decides to visit Babe, the dragon who manages the good luck, in hopes to get another penny. Babe tells Sam how better things would be if everyone had good luck before giving her a new penny. But Sam sacrifices her penny after Bob is caught for faking his travel penny to spare him from banishment. Still wanting to help Hazel, Sam and Bob decide to temporarily shut down the Bad Luck Apparat to prevent bad luck from going to the Randomizer and give Hazel the luck she needs to get adopted. However, the bad luck specks start to clog Jeff's machines and destroy the good luck and bad luck stones within the Randomizer, which itself brings bad luck to the Land of Luck and Earth. Seeing Hazel did not get adopted because of this, learning that Bob is actually an unlucky English cat and having been found out as a human, Sam sulks in remorse. Bob apologizes and says that Hazel is the luckiest girl for having Sam at her side. Sam realizes things can be fixed because she remembers seeing some good luck in Bad Luck land while on her way to the In-Between. In Bad Luck, they find it in a tiki bar where the bartender, a root monster named Rootie, who is Bob's old friend, gives them a jar of good luck they have been using. They take it to Babe to forge new good and bad luck stones. However, while creating a bad luck stone, Babe makes two good luck stones, wanting to create a world with only good luck. Before she can place them, Sam tells Babe people need bad luck as much as good luck. Realizing her mistake, she allows Sam to place the bad luck stone, and good luck is restored to normal, where Sam sees Hazel getting adopted by a new family. Bob is offered to keep his job at the Land of Luck, but decides he wants to live with Sam. One year later, on Earth, Hazel's family spends time with Sam and Bob, who have accepted their bad luck.",

    "plot": "In June 2021, high schooler Hodaka Morishima runs away from home. When his ferry to Tokyo is hit by a torrential rainstorm, he is almost washed away, but is saved by Keisuke Suga. Suga gives the boy his business card and tells him to call if he needs a job. Hodaka struggles to find work in the city. He finds an abandoned Makarov PM handgun and keeps it even though guns are illegal. He meets Hina Amano, a McDonald's employee, who pities him and gives him free food. Suga hires him as his assistant; he and his niece Natsumi publish a small occult magazine investigating strange phenomena, including the unusually rainy weather. They hear the legend of \"sunshine girls\" who can stop rain, and bring sunshine. Hodaka sees Hina being intimidated into working at a club and in panic, fires his gun at the club owner, barely missing him. Frightened, he throws the gun aside. Hina takes him to Yoyogi Kaikan, an abandoned building with a shrine on the roof, and amazes him by demonstrating her ability to clear the sky by praying. Hodaka learns that Hina is an orphan living alone with her younger brother Nagi. Seeing that they are also in financial trouble, Hodaka proposes they start a business having Hina clear the weather for social gatherings. Their business becomes a success, but Hina is filmed and shown on television, leading to their site getting flooded with requests. They decide to temporarily suspend business to let Hina rest. Meanwhile, Suga and Natsumi interview the old priest of a shrine who tells them the legend of \"Weather Maidens\" who can control the rain, adding that they pay a heavy price for their powers. Meanwhile, police are searching for Hodaka, whose family has reported him missing. They trace him using security footage of him using the gun. Officers arrive at Hina's apartment and interrogate her; Hina realizes that because they have no legal guardian, social services will separate her and Nagi. Suga, also visited by the police, fires Hodaka, explaining that police suspect him of kidnapping, and gives him severance pay in cash. Hodaka, Hina, and Nagi decide to run away together. Meanwhile, torrential rain, unnatural cold, and even snow continue to descend on Tokyo. A state of emergency is declared in response to the severe and abnormal weather. Police spot Hodaka as a fugitive and restrain him, but he is saved by Hina, who unintentionally uses her powers to destroy a police van with lightning. They take shelter in a hotel using the cash Hodaka got from Suga. Hina reveals that her body is slowly turning transparent the more she uses her power, and says her sacrifice will allow the weather to return to normal. The next day, Hina has vanished and the rain has stopped. The police track Hodaka to the hotel and take him into custody. Nagi is sent to the children's counseling center. Hodaka, realizing that he has fallen in love with Hina, escapes from custody with the help of Suga's niece Natsumi. The police surround Hodaka in the abandoned building, but Suga, inspired by Hodaka's desperation to find Hina, helps him escape. At the rooftop shrine, Hodaka jumps through the torii gate and is transported into the sky, where he finds Hina and asks her to return with him, insisting that she let go of her worries about the weather and start living for herself. As soon as they return to the rooftop shrine, Hina, Hodaka, Natsumi, Nagi, and Suga are all arrested, and the heavy rains resume. Hodaka is sentenced to three years of probation and sent back to his home in Kōzu-shima. Three years later, the rain has been falling without end in Tokyo, submerging much of the city. In spring 2024, having finished his probation, Hodaka graduates from high school and returns to Tokyo to start college. He meets with Suga, who has expanded his business. After Suga encourages him to find Hina, Hodaka finds her praying on a street overlooking the drowned city. They reunite, with Hodaka promising her that they will be all right.",

Returning to London from China, she learns that her ex-fiancé Hamish Ascot has taken over his deceased father's company and plans to have Alice sign over her father's ship in exchange for her family home. Alice follows a butterfly she recognizes as Absolem, who was previously a caterpillar, and returns to Wonderland through a mirror. Alice is greeted by the White Queen, the White Rabbit, the Tweedles, the Dormouse, the March Hare, the Bloodhound and the Cheshire Cat, who reveal that the Mad Hatter is acting madder than usual because his family is gone. Alice tries to console the Hatter, but he remains certain that his family is still alive. Seeing it as the only way to restore his health, the White Queen sends Alice to consult Time and convince him to save the Hatter's family in the past. The Queen warns Alice that history will be destroyed if a person's past and present selves meet. In Time's Castle of Eternity lies the Chronosphere, an object that controls all of time in Wonderland. After Time tells Alice that altering the past is impossible, she steals the Chronosphere and travels back in time. The exiled Red Queen orders Time to pursue Alice, who accidentally travels to the Red Queen's crowning. There, a younger Mad Hatter mocks the Red Queen when the crown does not fit her abnormal head. When her father deems her unfit to rule, the Red Queen throws a tantrum that causes her head to swell and vows revenge on the Hatter. Alice learns of an event in both the Queens' pasts that causes friction between the two and travels back in time again, hoping to change the Red Queen's character. The young White Queen steals a tart from her mother and leaves crumbs under her sister's bed. When confronted by their mother, the White Queen lies and lets her sister take the blame, causing the young Red Queen to run out of the castle in tears. Alice sees her about to run into a clock being carried across the square; believing this to be the event that changes her head, she pushes the clock out of the way. However, the young Red Queen still falls and hits her head. Alice is confronted by a weakened Time, who berates her for putting all of time in danger. She runs into a nearby mirror and back into the real world, where she wakes up in a mental hospital, diagnosed with female hysteria. With the help of her mother, she returns to Wonderland, travels to the Jabberwocky attack and discovers that the Hatter's family was captured by the Red Queen's Red Knights. Returning to the present, Alice sees that the Mad Hatter is at the brink of death. After Alice tearfully says she believes him, the Hatter awakens and reforms back to his normal self. The Wonderlanders go to the Red Queen's second castle and find the Hatter's family shrunk and trapped in an ant farm. The Red Queen apprehends them and steals the Chronosphere from Alice, taking her sister back to the day she lied about the tart to hide behind a door and listen to the scene. The White Queen whispers \"No,\" as her younger self denies stealing the tart; the Red Queen furiously bursts through the door and screams at her sister's younger self. The young Red Queen sees her older self, creating a time paradox, and their faces and bodies rust. All of Wonderland then begins to be taken over by the rust. Using the Chronosphere, Alice and the Hatter race back to the present, where Alice runs for her life to place the Chronosphere back in its original place. Initially, she outruns the rust, but is stopped with her hand just above the stand. Sparks make the connection and the rust dissolves. The Mad Hatter reunites with his family, while the White Queen apologizes to the redeemed Red Queen for lying. Alice bids her friends farewell and returns to the real world. Upon Alice's return, her mother refuses to turn Alice's ship over to Hamish. Alice and her mother start their own company and travel on its behalf.",

    "title": "Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind",
    "plot": "One thousand years have passed since the Seven Days of Fire, an apocalyptic war that destroyed civilization and caused an ecocide, creating the vast Toxic Jungle, a poisonous forest swarming with giant mutant insects. In the kingdom of the Valley of the Wind, a prophecy predicts a savior \"clothed in a blue robe, descending onto a golden field\". The Valley's princess Nausicaä explores the jungle and communicates with its creatures, including the gigantic, trilobite-like armored Ohm. She hopes to understand the jungle and find a way for it and humans to coexist. One morning, a massive cargo aircraft from the militaristic Empire of Tolmekia crashes in the Valley despite Nausicaä's efforts to save it. Its sole survivor, Princess Lastelle of Pejite, asks Nausicaä to destroy the cargo before she dies. The cargo is an embryo of a Giant Warrior, one of the lethal, gargantuan humanoid bioweapons that caused the Seven Days of Fire. Tolmekia seized the embryo and Lastelle from Pejite, but their plane was unable to support the embryo's weight and landed in the forest, causing the insects to attack. One of the insects emerges wounded from the wreckage and poises to attack, but Nausicaä uses a bullroarer to calm it and guides it away from the village. Soon after, Tolmekian soldiers under the command of Princess Kushana invade the Valley and kill Nausicaä's father, Jihl. Nausicaä briefly fights the Tolmekians, but the Valley's elderly swordsmaster, Yupa, intervenes and ushers both Nausicaä and the Tolmekians to stand down. Kushana, having retrieved the Giant Warrior's embryo, plans to mature and use the bioweapon to burn the Toxic Jungle. The valley's wise woman, Obaba, warns that such a feat cannot be done as many have tried to destroy the forest before, but the Ohm have attacked and destroyed many cities and killed thousands of people. Yupa discovers a secret garden of jungle plants that had been cared for by Nausicaä; according to her findings, plants that grow in clean soil and water are not toxic, but the jungle's soil has been tainted by pollution. Kushana leaves for Tolmekian-occupied Pejite with Nausicaä and five hostages from the Valley, but a Pejite interceptor shoots down the Tolmekian airships carrying them. Nausicaä, Kushana and the hostages crash-land in the jungle, disturbing several Ohm, which Nausicaä soothes. She leaves to rescue the interceptor's pilot, who turns out to be Princess Lastelle's twin brother, Asbel, but both crash through a stratum of quicksand into a non-toxic area below the Toxic Jungle. Nausicaä realizes that the jungle plants purify the polluted topsoil, producing clean water and soil underground. Nausicaä and Asbel reach Pejite but find it ravaged by insects. They learn that the local survivors lured the insects to eradicate the Tolmekians, and are doing the same to the Valley. Nausicaä is taken prisoner, but escapes with the help of a group of Pejite sympathizers, including Asbel and his mother. She soon discovers two Pejite soldiers using a wounded baby Ohm to lure thousands of Ohm into the Valley. As the Tolmekians fight against the Ohm, the Giant Warrior, having hatched prematurely, disintegrates after killing a fraction of the Ohm. Meanwhile, Nausicaä fights the Pejite soldiers and liberates the baby Ohm, but the pink dress she received from Asbel's mother is drenched in blue by the Ohm's blood. Nausicaä and the Ohm return to the Valley and stand before the herd but are run over. The Ohm calm down and resuscitate her with their golden tentacles. Nausicaä walks atop the tentacles as through golden fields, fulfilling the savior prophecy. With the Valley saved, the Ohm and Tolmekians leave as the Pejites remain with the Valley people, helping them rebuild. Deep underneath the Toxic Jungle, a non-toxic tree sprouts.",

The experiment was a success at first, then went haywire, transporting Thanagar into Rann's atmosphere, upsetting the ecosystem of both planets, restarting the war, and apparently killing Jordan and thousands of Thanagarians and Rannians. Shayera accuses Rann of sabotaging the experiment and attacking Oa, but Stewart and Green Arrow insist they investigate further. The team travels to a Rannian military outpost that was raided by Thanagarians, where they encounter Rannian hero Adam Strange, presumed deceased but teleported at random by Zeta-Beams' attraction to him. Strange denies that Rann attacked Oa and leads them to Rannian High Command, engaged in a battle with Thanagarian forces. Rannian Captain Kantus reveals that Rannian scientist Sardath, Strange's father-in-law, has converted the Zeta-Beam project into a doomsday weapon to destroy Thanagar. Shayera and Strange review footage from past attacks and discover that a third party has been impersonating both Rannian and Thanagarian ships to further the war. Retracing the trajectories of the imposter ships, the team discovers a base hidden inside an asteroid, where they battle the Yellow Lanterns, along with a group of galactic assassins including Lord Damyn, Kanjar Ro, and Despero, before being captured by their leader Sinestro. Jordan is revealed to be alive, having released his ring and been taken prisoner after Sinestro sabotaged the Zeta-Beam experiment. They escape as Sinestro and his Lanterns attack Rann to find the location of Sardath's doomsday weapon. Using the Zeta-Beams, Sardath teleports them to his secret base, but Sinestro and his Lanterns follow and attack. During the battle, Stewart reluctantly kills Sinestro and Jordan brutally kills two of Sinestro's assassins leaving Green Arrow and John Stewart suspicious of his actions. After obtaining the Zeta-Beam data, Jordan suddenly kills Sardath; he reveals that, when he was captured, Sinestro had infected him with the Parallax Entity, corrupting him. After Sinestro had destroyed the Green Lanterns, Jordan had claimed all their rings for himself, enhancing his power to a godlike state. With the Zeta-Beam technology, Jordan intends to destroy both Rann and Thanagar in a quest to end conflict across the galaxy and reshape it in his own image. Stewart and Jordan battle until Green Arrow is forced to shoot and kill Jordan. They are unable to stop the weapon from firing, but Strange flies in the path of the Zeta-Beam, teleporting it and himself to parts unknown. Stewart and Green Arrow return to Earth, and Stewart sends Jordan's rings to their new wearers to rebuild the Green Lantern Corps. Shayera departs from Earth, in Ganthet's spaceship, promising to Green Arrow and Stewart they would meet again soon knowing Rann and Thanagar will need the new Green Lanterns and the Justice League to help rebuild both worlds when a ceasefire is ordered. Stewart proposes dinner and a toast to \"absent friends\" to Green Arrow, to which he replies \"and maybe a few new ones\".",

    "title": "Miraculous: Ladybug & Cat Noir, The Movie",
    "plot": "Marinette Dupain-Cheng, a clumsy, socially awkward teenager living in Paris, goes to school trying to avoid being noticed. Despite sparking a friendship with another student, Alya Césaire, Marinette finds herself desperately attempting to avoid the wrath of rich, bratty girl, Chloé Bourgeois. While attempting to escape, Marinette runs into a boy named Adrien Agreste and starts crushing on him. Adrien has become incredibly emotionally distant from others because of his mother, Emilie Agreste's, recent passing. Similarly wracked by her death, Adrien's father, Gabriel Agreste, uses the Butterfly Miraculous, a magical jewel, to turn into Hawk Moth and create chaos, in hopes of luring out the holders of the Ladybug and Black Cat Miraculouses. Since those two Miraculouses combined possess a \"power stronger than death\", Gabriel hopes to use them to bring his wife back to life. Hawk Moth's appearance is sensed by Wang Fu, guardian of the Miracle Box, who chooses to release the Ladybug and Black Cat Miraculouses, only for them to fly away. Fu chases after the Ladybug Miraculous and runs into the street in the process, nearly being hit by an oncoming bus, but is saved by Marinette, who is still running away from Chloé. Fu realizes that Marinette deserves the Miraculous, watching as it flies into her bag. Marinette ducks into a corner shop in an alley and meets Tikki, the Kwami of Creation, while her polar opposite, Plagg, the Kwami of Destruction, makes his way to Adrien. Tikki explains the situation to Marinette, who is initially reluctant to become a superhero due to her lack of self-confidence and innate clumsiness. Tikki eventually forcibly transforms her into the hero Ladybug, and she quickly runs into Adrien, who has now used his Miraculous to become Cat Noir. Both clumsily work together to fight The Gargoyle, an \"akumatized\" villain created by Hawk Moth from the negative emotions of a Paris civilian. The battle ends when The Gargoyle is hit by a train, with Cat Noir also nearly being hit. Ladybug saves him, resulting in him developing a crush on her. Following the fight, Wang Fu approaches the pair and stresses the importance of them working together. Marinette initially refuses to continue being Ladybug, but Hawk Moth recruits more villains to cause havoc. Gathering the courage to fight, Marinette transforms once again, and defeats them, alongside Cat Noir. After defeating all of the akumatized villains Hawk Moth has sent their way, the two superheroes build the confidence to ask out their respective crush; Marinette confesses her feelings to Adrien, whilst Cat Noir confesses his love to Ladybug. Being unaware of their true identities, neither confession goes well, damaging their teamwork. While hurting from his rejection, Adrien lashes out at his father for being neglectful. Desperate, Hawk Moth akumatizes himself and begins wreaking havoc on Paris, prompting Ladybug and Cat Noir to go into action, though not as a united team. The heroes are overwhelmed, and Ladybug has her earrings taken, but Marinette manages to briefly power through to save Cat Noir from Hawk Moth. When Cat Noir's mask is damaged, a horrified Hawk Moth discovers that Adrien is Cat Noir and renounces his Miraculous powers. Gabriel explains himself to Adrien and repents and realizes that the \"power stronger than death\" was referring to love. Seeing him remorseful for his actions, Adrien forgives his father and reconciles with him, while Marinette reclaims her earrings and returns the Butterfly Miraculous to Wang Fu. Ladybug is then able to utilize the full extent of her power of creation using love and repairs all the damage done to Paris. Gabriel is exposed publicly as Hawk Moth and arrested, while Marinette returns to her family. Weeks pass, and the day of the Winter Ball arrives. Marinette arrives in a beautiful dress much to the crowd's pleasure. She finds Adrien, revealing that she knows his identity, having seen his reconciliation during the fight, and reveals her identity as well. They then share a first kiss. At the Agreste Mansion, Nathalie Sancoeur, the Agrestes' assistant, enters a hidden room in Gabriel's office. Inside is the body of Adrien's mother, wearing the Peacock Miraculous. A voice-over from Gabriel instructs her to keep it a secret.",

    "plot": "Sarah Bailey, a troubled teenage girl with unusual abilities, moves from San Francisco to Los Angeles with her father and stepmother. At her new school, she befriends a trio of outcast girls rumoured to be witches. Bonnie Harper bears burn scars, Nancy Downs lives in a trailer with her mother and abusive stepfather, and Rochelle Zimmerman is a black student who is subjected to racist bullying by a group of white girls. The girls worship a powerful earth deity they call \"Manon\". Popular jock Chris Hooker shows interest in Sarah, which she reciprocates. When Bonnie observes Sarah levitating a pencil in class, she and the other outcast girls are convinced that she can complete their coven as \"the fourth\", completing a Four Element circle and making them all-powerful. As the girls walk home from school, Sarah is harassed by a vagrant, who had tried to scare her with a snake when she moved into her new home. When the vagrant chases after Sarah, he is immediately hit by a car. The girls believe their combined will caused it to happen, strengthening their bond. It is also revealed that Sarah once attempted suicide. After a date with Chris, Sarah is upset that he spread a false rumor that they had sex. Sarah casts a love spell on him, Rochelle casts a revenge spell on racist bully Laura Lizzie, Bonnie casts a spell for beauty, and Nancy a spell for power. The spells are successful: Chris becomes infatuated with Sarah, Bonnie's scars on her back miraculously heal, Laura begins losing her hair, and Nancy causes her stepfather to have a fatal heart attack, enabling her and her mother to cash in on his life insurance policy and move into a luxurious high-rise apartment. Nancy becomes power-hungry and encourages the others to join her in a rite called \"Invocation of the Spirit\", despite being warned against the spell by Lirio, the owner of a local occult shop and practicing witch. Upon completion of the spell, Nancy is struck by lightning. The following morning, the other girls see Nancy walking on water, with beached sharks and other dead animals littering the shore. In the days that follow, Nancy becomes increasingly devoid of empathy and engages in risky behavior that endangers her life and those of others. The spells the girls cast eventually lead to negative consequences, as Bonnie becomes aggressively narcissistic, Rochelle finds Laura traumatized by her baldness, and the obsessed Chris attempts to rape Sarah after she rejects his continual advances. To punish Chris, Nancy uses a glamour spell to disguise herself as Sarah and attempts to seduce him at a party. She is interrupted by the real Sarah, who pleads with Nancy to leave with her. Upset at being deceived, Chris accuses Nancy of jealousy, angering her. She uses her power to kill Chris by throwing him out of a window. Sarah unsuccessfully attempts a binding spell to prevent Nancy from doing more harm, and the coven turns on Sarah. The trio invades Sarah's dreams, torments her with visions of swarms of scorpions, snakes, rats, and insects, and makes her believe that her family has died in a plane crash. The coven then tries to drive Sarah to suicide. Although initially terrified, Sarah successfully invokes the spirit and manages to heal herself and fight back. She scares Bonnie and Rochelle off by showing them glamour in a mirror of Bonnie, with her face scarred, and Rochelle losing her hair like Laura. Sarah then defeats Nancy and binds her, preventing her from causing harm forever. Bonnie and Rochelle, finding their powers gone, visit Sarah to attempt reconciliation, only to find that she wants nothing to do with them and that Manon took their powers because they abused them. They scornfully mutter that Sarah must have lost her powers, too. Sarah then conjures a lightning storm and makes a tree branch nearly crush them. She warns them to be careful not to end up like Nancy, who has been committed to a psychiatric hospital, delusional and her powers bound, strapped to a bed as she desperately insists she can fly.",

    "title": "Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb",
    "plot": "In 1938, a team of archaeologists is searching for the tomb of pharaoh Ahkmenrah in Egypt. Among the group is young Cecil \"C.J.\" Fredericks, who discovers the Tablet of Ahkmenrah. As the team packs up the artifacts due to an incoming sandstorm, the locals warn them about removing the tablet from the tomb, saying \"the end will come.\" 76 years later in New York City, five years after the events of the second film, Larry Daley remains the night guard of the Museum of Natural History. He and the other exhibits are hosting an event to help re-open the Hayden Planetarium. As Larry makes sure everything is ready, the other exhibits inform him that the museum commissioned a new Neanderthal model resembling Larry. The new Neanderthal calls himself Laaa and considers Larry his father. Later, Ahkmenrah shows Larry that the tablet has a mysterious corrosion. As the corrosion spreads, the exhibits act abnormally and cause massive chaos at the planetarium. After calming the situation, Larry, frustrated, returns home to find his teenage son Nick throwing a party, but discusses his son's post-high school future with him afterwards. To discover what is happening to the tablet, Larry reunites with now-retired Cecil, a member of the expedition who discovered the tomb. Cecil remembers \"the end will come\" prophecy and realizes it refers to the tablet's magic ending and the exhibits becoming lifeless. Cecil says Ahkmenrah's parents, Merenkahre and Shepseheret, may be able to restore the tablet's power, but that they are in the British Museum. Larry convinces museum curator Dr. McPhee, who was fired due to the planetarium incident, to let him ship Ahkmenrah to London to restore the tablet, although McPhee believes the magic is just clever special effects. Larry and Nick travel to the U.K. and go to the British Museum, bypassing the night guard Tilly. Larry discovers that some of the American exhibits have stowed away with Ahkmenrah: Theodore Roosevelt, Sacagawea, Attila the Hun, miniatures Jedediah and Octavius, Dexter the capuchin monkey, and Laaa. As Larry and the others search the museum, the tablet brings the British exhibits to life. The group is joined by a wax figure of Sir Lancelot, who helps fight off aggressive museum exhibits like a Triceratops skeleton and a Xiangliu statue. The tablet's corrosion worsens, and the American exhibits begin experiencing side-effects such as stiffening limbs and memory reversion. The group finds Ahkmenrah's parents. They learn the tablet's power can be regenerated by moonlight, since it is empowered through the magic of Khonsu. Lancelot steals the tablet, mistaking it for the Holy Grail, and prepares to leave for Camelot. Tilly locks Larry and Laaa in the employee break room, but Attila helps them escape. Laaa remains behind to distract Tilly; they become attracted to each other. Lancelot crashes the musical Camelot starring Hugh Jackman and Alice Eve and is stunned to realize that unlike the other exhibits, Lancelot and Camelot are not real. Larry and the others chase Lancelot to the theatre's roof, where the corrosion almost consumes the entire tablet, turning the exhibits back into their lifeless forms. The group tells Lancelot that although Camelot never existed, he can have a life. Lancelot gives the tablet back, allowing Larry to straighten the pieces as the moonlight restores the tablet's power and the exhibits. As the American exhibits prepare to return home, they decide that Ahkmenrah and his tablet should stay at the British Museum with his parents, even though this means the New York exhibits will no longer come to life. Larry is upset, but they all inform him that they are at peace with their unanimous decision. Ahkmenrah thanks Larry for reuniting him with his family, and the exhibits go home. Back in New York, Larry spends some final moments with his friends and says goodbye to them before the sun rises, and then he leaves the museum for the last time as he and Nick go their own ways. Three years later, Larry now works as a school teacher after the museum rehired McPhee. Tilly brings a traveling exhibit to New York in a collaboration with the museum. In McPhee's office, Tilly hands the tablet to McPhee, showing him its power and allowing the exhibits to awaken again as they throw a huge party. From across the street, Larry quietly observes the celebration and smiles.",

    "title": "Pacific Rim: Uprising",
    "plot": "In 2035, ten years after the events of the previous film, the Jaeger Program has been reinstated and now thrives under the watchful eye of Mako Mori, currently the Senator who runs the Pan Pacific Defense Corps (PPDC). Former Jaeger pilot and Stacker Pentecost's son, Jake, ekes out a living for himself in the Relief Zones (abandoned sections of cities destroyed by past Kaiju battles), mostly by stealing and selling Jaeger parts on the black market in Santa Monica, California. After tracking a disabled Jaeger's power core to the secret workshop of fifteen-year-old Jaeger enthusiast Amara Namani, both are apprehended by the PPDC following an altercation between Amara's small, single-pilot Jaeger Scrapper and the law enforcement Jaeger November Ajax. Mako persuades Jake to return to the PPDC as an instructor to avoid prison, with Amara as his recruit. Arriving at the China Shatterdome, Jake begins training Jaeger cadets alongside his estranged former co-pilot, Nathan \"Nate\" Lambert. Nate and Mako explain that the Jaeger program is threatened by Shao Industries' new drone program, which offers to mass-produce Jaeger drones developed by Liwen Shao and Dr. Newton \"Newt\" Geiszler. Mako is due to deliver a final assessment to determine the approval of the drones at a PPDC council meeting in Sydney. A rogue Jaeger, Obsidian Fury, attacks the city and during an altercation between the former and Jake and Nate's Jaeger Gipsy Avenger, Mako gets killed. Obsidian Fury escapes into the ocean before backup Jaegers can apprehend it. Mako's death prompts the PPDC council to authorize and deploy the drones immediately. Moments before her death, Mako had transmitted the location of a defunct Jaeger production facility in Severnaya Zemlya, Siberia. Jake and Nate travel there in Gipsy Avenger, but Obsidian Fury destroys the complex and engages them in battle. Although Obsidian Fury initially has the upper hand, Gipsy Avenger manages to overpower and destroy the Jaeger's power core. Upon removing its control module, they find Obsidian Fury not controlled by humans, but by a Kaiju's secondary brain, which testing shows was grown on Earth. When the drones reach their respective locations, they become hijacked by cloned Kaiju brains secretly mounted on board. The Kaiju-Jaeger hybrids simultaneously attack all Shatterdomes, incapacitating most of the Jaegers and inflicting heavy casualties, with Marshal Quan getting killed in the process. While attempting to sabotage the drones, Dr. Hermann Gottlieb discovers that Newt, whose mind is possessed by the Kaiju's creators, the Precursors, due to him drifting with Kaiju brains, is responsible for the attack when he commands the Kaiju-Jaeger hybrids to open multiple breaches across the Pacific Rim. Newt had also implanted the brains for both the drones and Obsidian Fury in accordance with the Precursors' plan. Although Liwen destroys the drones, closing the breaches in the process, three Kaiju—Hakuja, Shrikethorn, and Raijin—had already emerged and reached Tokyo. The team realizes that the Precursors' true endgame is to detonate Mount Fuji with the Kaijus' reactive blood, which will cause every volcano lining the Ring of Fire to erupt, releasing volcanic matter into the atmosphere and causing an extinction-level event. This simultaneously causes terraformation of the planet for Precursor colonization. The cadets are mobilized while Hermann and Liwen repair Gipsy Avenger and three salvageable Jaegers Bracer Phoenix, Saber Athena and Guardian Bravo. Hermann develops Kaiju-blood-powered rockets, which launches the team to Tokyo. Although the Jaegers initially repel the Kaiju, Newt merges them into a \"Mega-Kaiju\" using robotic parasites from one of Liwen's factories. Gipsy Avenger is the sole survivor when the other three Jaegers are destroyed or heavily damaged. Jake and Amara, replacing the injured Nate, pursue the Mega-Kaiju, with Liwen aiding them by remote piloting Scrapper and welding a rocket to Gipsy Avenger, which sends both Jaegers into the atmosphere and free-falling back to Earth. Jake and Amara transfer to Scrapper before Gipsy Avenger collides into the Mega-Kaiju and kills it at the last second. Angered by the Mega-Kaiju's death, Newt attempts to initiate a backup plan but is knocked out and captured by Nate. Confronting an imprisoned Newt, who warns of the Precursors' return, Jake states that humanity is preparing to take the fight to them.",

At the same moment, Dr. Griffiths and his daughter Elizabeth \"Lizzy\" arrive at the house, their summer home. Lizzy leaves out a hand-made fairy house, which Tink is fascinated by and enters, despite Vidia's constant warnings. In an attempt to shock Tink, Vidia slams the door shut, accidentally jamming it. When Lizzy returns, Vidia tries to free Tink to no avail, resulting in Lizzy discovering Tink and taking her home. Lizzy attempts to show Tink to her father, but he is too busy. Seeing all the butterflies he has pinned on display for research, Lizzy decides to keep Tink a secret. In her room, Lizzy reveals her love for fairies to Tinker Bell and her desire to have a friend. Complimented by Lizzy's fascination, Tink decides to teach her about fairies; Lizzy records all the information in a blank field journal given to her by her father and the two form a friendship. As the rain dies down, the two say goodbye; Tink prepares to leave, while Lizzy runs downstairs to show her father her research. But Tink sees that Lizzy's father is too busy dealing with many leaks in the ceiling to pay attention. Tink spends the night fixing the leaks so Dr. Griffiths can spend more time with his daughter. When she finishes, she releases a captive butterfly that, unknown to her, Dr. Griffiths had intended to show to a museum committee in London. Meanwhile, Vidia mobilizes Rosetta, Iridessa, Fawn, Silvermist, Clank and Bobble to rescue Tinker Bell. Due to their inability to fly in the rain, the group build a boat to sail to the house. Despite smooth sailing at first, the boat encounters a waterfall and crashes, forcing the party to proceed on foot. On the way, Vidia confesses that it was her fault that Tink was captured, but they forgive her and tell her it would have been worse if she had not been there at all. The next morning, Lizzy is excited to hear that the leaks have stopped. She runs down to show her father her research, but instead, he blames her for the missing butterfly and sends her back to her room, dismissing her steadfast belief in the existence of fairies. To make it up to her, Tink teaches Lizzy to fly with pixie dust, but the commotion brings her father upstairs. Dr. Griffiths sternly demands the truth, and Lizzy confesses in tears about Tink, but Dr. Griffiths still refuses to believe in fairies. Outraged, Tink bursts out of her hiding place and lashes out at Lizzy's father, much to his surprise. At the same moment, the rescue party arrives at the house. While the rest of them distract Lizzy's cat, Vidia climbs upstairs to find Tinker Bell. Seeing Dr. Griffiths about to capture her in a jar, Vidia quickly bumps Tink out of the way and gets caught instead. Ignoring Lizzy's pleas, her father unknowingly takes Vidia and drives to London to show his discovery to the museum committee. Lizzy, with the help of Tink and the other fairies, takes flight in the sky and pursues her father to London. Flying ahead, Tinker Bell tampers with the car's engine, causing it to stop and allowing Lizzy to catch up. Lizzy pleads with her father not to take Vidia, and Dr. Griffiths finally listens to his daughter, apologizing for not believing her. Vidia is freed and Lizzy and the fairies teach her father to fly, and they all return home. The next day, Lizzy and her father have a picnic with the fairies outside the fairy camp tree, reading Lizzy's field journal.",

    "title": "The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian",
    "plot": "In Narnia, almost 1,300 years after the Pevensie siblings (King Peter, Queen Susan, King Edmund, and Queen Lucy) left Narnia and returned to their world, Caspian, a Telmarine prince, is awakened by his mentor, Doctor Cornelius. Doctor Cornelius informs Caspian that his aunt has just given birth to a son and that his life is now in grave danger. Cornelius gives him Queen Susan's ancient magical horn and instructs him to use it if he is in dire need. Knowing that his Uncle Miraz would kill him to be king, Caspian flees. Chased by several Telmarine soldiers, Caspian falls from his horse and encounters two Narnian dwarfs and a talking badger in the woods. One of the dwarfs, Trumpkin, is captured by the soldiers after sacrificing himself to save Caspian. The other dwarf, Nikabrik, and the badger, Trufflehunter, save Caspian. Not knowing they are trying to save him, Caspian blows the magical horn, trying to summon help. In England, after one year has passed in their world since they left Narnia, the four Pevensie children wait at the Strand tube station for their train, which will take them to boarding school. Just as the train pulls into the station, the station tears apart, and they are transported back to Narnia. There, they discover their castle, Cair Paravel, was attacked and ruined in their absence. The Pevensies save a bound and gagged Trumpkin, who is about to be drowned, and they set out together. Lucy sees Aslan trying to show them a safe path but finds her siblings unable to see him. She later manages to contact Aslan in a dream, but only Edmund believes her. Meanwhile, Nikabrik and Trufflehunter lead Caspian to the Dancing Lawn, where all the old Narnians have assembled. Caspian convinces them to help him win his throne. Caspian and his troops encounter the Pevensies and Trumpkin, and they journey together to Aslan's How, a huge underground hall built over the Stone Table. Lucy wants to wait for Aslan, but Peter decides they have waited long enough and suggests attacking Miraz's castle. Caspian and the Pevensies infiltrate the castle at night with the intent of opening the gates for the Narnian army, but Caspian, learning that Miraz is responsible for his father's death, confronts his uncle and compromises the attack. The attack fails because of Caspian's actions, and many Narnians are killed due to Peter's recklessness. Nikabrik and a werewolf tell Caspian that there is a way he can claim revenge. When Caspian agrees, a hag uses black sorcery to summon the White Witch. From inside a wall of ice, the spirit of the Witch tries to convince Caspian to give her a drop of his blood to resurrect her. The spirit of the Witch attempts to convince Peter to do the same. Edmund, Trumpkin, and Lucy arrive and kill the rogues. Edmund shatters the wall of ice before the Witch can be resurrected. Seeking redemption for his failure at Miraz's castle, Peter challenges Miraz to a one-on-one duel to buy Lucy time to find Aslan. Peter wounds Miraz and gives his sword to Caspian to finish him off. Caspian spares Miraz's life but says he intends to return Narnia to its people. Lord Sopespian, one of Miraz's generals, kills Miraz with an arrow and blames the Narnians, igniting a massive battle between the Narnians and the Telmarines. Lucy, meanwhile, has found Aslan in the woods; he awakens the trees, and the whole forest suddenly attacks the Telmarines. Lord Sopespian orders the retreat, only to be confronted by Lucy and Aslan. Aslan summons a river god, who wipes out most of the Telmarine army, including Sopespian; the surviving Telmarine soldiers surrender to the Narnians. Caspian becomes the King of Narnia and, with Aslan's help, brings peace between the Narnian and Telmarine kingdoms. Before the Pevensies depart, Peter and Susan reveal that Aslan has told them they will never re-enter Narnia again since they have learned all they can from Narnia, but Lucy and Edmund might still come back. The Pevensies return to England, leaving Caspian as King of Narnia.",

    "title": "Seventh Son",
    "plot": "In 1572, the witch Malkin is imprisoned underground by Gregory, the last of the Falcons, a knightly order which defended mankind against supernatural threats. Years later, Gregory works as a \"spook\" – a roving witch hunter. Malkin escapes, killing Gregory's apprentice William, and fleeing to her mountain fortress. She restores the fortress and the beauty of her disfigured, loyal sister, Bony Lizzie. The coming centennial blood moon will make Malkin unstoppable. Gregory seeks out Tom Ward – the seventh son of a seventh son – as his new apprentice. Tom's Mam gives him her necklace as a talisman, urging him to never take it off. In a town, Tom sees a girl, Alice, about to be burned as a witch. Recognizing her from his clairvoyant visions, Tom frees her. Alice requests that he not tell Gregory about her. She is revealed to be Lizzie's daughter, sent to spy on Gregory. Malkin begins gathering an army of minions. Tom meets Gregory's assistant, Tusk. With only a week before the blood moon is full, reviving Malkin's full power, Tom must rush through his training while the trio head to Malkin's fortress. En route, Gregory is summoned to a walled city by an inquisitor whose forces have subdued one of Malkin's followers, a werebear named Urag. Tom hesitates when instructed to burn the werebear alive, causing Gregory to dismiss him and light the flame himself. Tom meets Alice again; the two share their feelings for each other and fall in love. They briefly consider running away, but Tom has a vision of Malkin killing Gregory and unleashing destruction upon the world. Tom returns to Gregory, who reveals that he once loved Malkin, leading him to imprison rather than kill her. Gregory feels responsible for every person killed by Malkin, and warns Tom never to show mercy to witches. The trio are attacked on the road by an enormous boggart. Tom kills it and survives being swept down a waterfall. He is confronted by Bony Lizzie, whose attack is repelled by his Mam's necklace. Gregory recognizes it as the Umbran Stone, which increases the power of witches. It had once belonged to Malkin, until one of her witch followers – Tom's Mam – stole it, weakening Malkin enough for Gregory to trap her. Malkin instructs Alice to steal the stone, promising to spare Tom's life. Malkin and her minions destroy the city where Urag was killed, to avenge his death. By chance, Tom's family is in the city; his Mam kills the warlock Strix and confronts Malkin with her own powers. Malkin kills her, mocking her for giving away the stone that might have saved her life. Alice finds Tom and pleads with him to leave with her. Gregory tries to kill her, but Tom intervenes, allowing her to flee. Gregory points out she has taken the necklace, and Tom, Gregory and Tusk pursue her. Malkin's servant Radu attacks them; he captures Gregory and drives Tusk and Tom over a cliff, leaving them for dead. Tom wakes to a vision of his Mam telling him that, as both the seventh son of a seventh son, and the son of a witch, he has a unique power to defeat Malkin. The witches gather as Malkin attempts to seduce Gregory. Alice is horrified when told that Tom is dead, and grabs the stone from Malkin, breaking Malkin's hold on Gregory. Malkin transforms into a dragon, and Lizzie also transforms, to protect her daughter. Tom retrieves the stone and, fighting together, Gregory, Tom and Alice kill several of Malkin's minions. Malkin kills Lizzie, but is seriously wounded. Gregory follows Malkin into her room and confronts her. Appearing close to death, she recalls their relationship, but then seizes Gregory with her claws. Tom enters and hurls a blade at Malkin, making her release her grip. Tom kills Malkin and they burn her body. Gregory brands Tom's hand, declaring him a Falcon knight. Alice accepts that Tom's vocation means they cannot be together, but promises they will meet again. Gregory leaves for parts unknown, leaving Tom and Tusk to continue his work, but urging Tom not to follow the \"rules\".",

    "plot": "Lord Su Hu of Jizhou rebels against the Shang dynasty. The Shang army, led by Prince Yin Shou, defeats the rebels. Shou and his hostage-sons break through rebel defenses and kill Su. Su Daji, the daughter of Su Hu, commits suicide but then emerges alive and is captured, with the Shang army returning home. King Di Yi is killed during the victory feast by a suddenly deranged Crown Prince Qi – Shou's brother; Qi is then accidentally killed by Ji Fa, a hostage-son from the western state of Xiqi. Shou becomes king. Divination during the coronation finds the dynasty to be cursed by the patri-regicide. Shou promises his own ritual suicide to placate the Heavens and lift the curse. Meanwhile, the Immortals of Kunlun consider giving Shou the Investiture Scroll, which can restore order and save the world from the curse. Jiang Ziya, a monk and a disciple of Yuanshi Tianzun, volunteers to deliver the scroll but realizes that Shou, a tyrant, should not have such power. Ziya leaves with the scroll and is joined by nephew-disciples Nezha and Yang Jian. They are pursued by Shen Gongbao, an alchemist and Ziya's rival, and Crown Prince Yin Jiao and Ji Fa. They encounter Ji Chang, Ji Fa's father and the Duke of the West, who is travelling to the capital Zhaoge to greet the new king. Chang finds an infant demon, whom he names Lei Zhenzi, and sends Zhenzi to Kunlun on Ziya's advice. Chang and the other three dukes (of the East, North and South) meet secretly; they are skeptical of the legitimacy of Shou's ascension. The meeting is discovered by royal guards. Shou orders the dukes to be executed for high treason by their hostage-sons. Chong Yingbiao, son of the Duke of the North, complies without hesitation. E Shun, son of the Duke of the South, instead attacks Shou, who kills them both. The Duke of the East kills himself on the sword of Jiang Wenhuan, his son. Ji Fa argues that Chang would suffer greater humiliation by making a public confession of faking divination than by being executed; Chang is sent to the dungeon. Bo Yikao, Chang's eldest son, attempts to release Chang from prison and offers to replace his father in prison. Bo Yikao was killed, minced and made into meat pies which Shou fed to Chang. On his eldest son's sacrifice, Chang confesses to treason to save Ji Fa, and is publicly paraded and humiliated. Meanwhile, Shou's son, Yin Jiao, finds and pursues a man-eating fox spirit in the palace, discovering it to be possessing the body of Su Daji. Shou accuses Jiao of attempted patricide to project Daji, now the favored consort. Daji killed Queen Jiang after the latter attempts to kill Daji. In a later attempt to kill Daji, Jiao was injured and escapes the palace with Ji Fa's help. Jiao, Ziya and High Priest Bi Gan, Shou's uncle, agree to expose the spirit to Shou. Bi Gan sacrifices his magical heart to evict the fox spirit from Daji's body, but Shou refuses to kill it, claiming it knows his ambition and is helping him to achieve it. The spirit was imprisoned by Tang of Shang but it was accidentally released by Shou during the battle of Jizhou. The spirit had charmed Qi to kill his father, paving the way for Shou to become the king. Jiao, who was hidden by Bi Gan, is arrested and sentenced to death. Shou ordered Ji Fa to kill his father, Ji Chang, but Ji Fa faked his father's death by showing the bagged 'head' to Shou. Chang was later rescued by Lei Zhenzi and returned to Xiqi. Ji Fa and the hostage-sons from Xiqi rebel during Jiao's execution. Chong Yingbiao decapitates Jiao, whose head and body are retrieved by Nezha and Yang Jian. Ji Fa fights and seriously wounds Shou before fleeing the city with Ziya. Ziya and the scroll are pursued by two Taotie statues possessed by Shen Gongbao. Ji Fa exchanges clothing with Ziya, draws the statues away, trapping one and escaping the other after jumping off a cliff into a river. He then rides back to Xiqi. Gongbao sends a swarm of crows against Ziya. In a few mid-credit scenes, the fox spirit - still possessing Daji's body - resuscitates Shou; Ziya fishes alone on Wei River and notices Gongbao's crows; Wen Zhong, Grand Preceptor of the Shang dynasty who has been away at war for ten years, returns to the capital along with his generals including the Four Demonic Giants.",

    "plot": "Gomez and Morticia Addams have a baby, and they name him Pubert. After a number of failed attempts by his siblings Wednesday and Pugsley to kill him, Gomez and Morticia gently rebuke them and hire the nanny Debbie Jellinsky to care for Pubert, not aware that Debbie is a serial killer who marries and then murders rich bachelors to collect their inheritances. After she seduces Uncle Fester, Wednesday becomes suspicious of her intentions. To maintain her cover, Debbie tricks Gomez and Morticia into believing Wednesday and Pugsley want to go to summer camp. They are sent to Camp Chippewa, managed by the bubbly counselors Gary Granger and Becky Martin-Granger. There, they are singled out by the campers, including popular and snobbish girl Amanda Buckman, for their macabre appearance and behavior. Joel Glicker, a nerdy bookworm and fellow outcast, becomes attracted to Wednesday. Debbie and Fester become engaged. At her bachelorette party, Debbie is repulsed by the Addams family and their relatives. At their wedding, Fester passionately and with great emotion declares his everlasting devotion, while Debbie offers a lackluster response. On their honeymoon, she tries unsuccessfully to kill Fester by throwing a boombox into the bathtub. Frustrated, Debbie forces him to cut ties with his family; when they try to visit Fester and Debbie at their home, they are turned away. The Addamses are alarmed to find that Pubert has transformed into a blue-eyed, rosy-cheeked and blond-haired baby. Grandmama attributes this to his disrupted family life, and Gomez becomes horribly depressed. Back at Camp Chippewa, the counselors cast Wednesday as Pocahontas in Gary's Thanksgiving play, \"A Turkey Named Brotherhood\". When she refuses to participate, she, Pugsley, and Joel are all sent to the camp's \"Harmony Hut\" and forced to watch hours of wholesome family entertainment movies and television shows. Afterwards, the three feign cheerfulness, and Wednesday agrees to take part. During the performance, Wednesday returns to being her true self. With help from Joel, Pugsley, and the other outcasts, they capture Amanda, Gary, and Becky by igniting the pilgrim set. Later, Wednesday and Joel share their first kiss before she leaves, with Joel staying behind to lead their friends to ensure the camp's permanent destruction. Pugsley and Wednesday return home in the campsite's stolen van. Meanwhile, Debbie tries to kill Fester by blowing up their mansion, but he survives. She then pulls a gun and reveals that she never loved him and was only after his money. Thing helps Fester escape. Fester later apologizes to Gomez at the Addams mansion, Wednesday and Pugsley return, successfully reuniting the family at last. Just then, Debbie arrives, holds them at gunpoint, and straps them into electric chairs to kill them all. The Addams family listens to her sympathetically, as she explains that as a child and young (self-proclaimed) ballerina, she killed her generous and doting parents, Sharon and Dave, after they gave her a Malibu Barbie doll on her 10th birthday rather than her desired Ballerina Barbie. Then, as an adult, she murdered her first two husbands for incredibly frivolous and materialistic reasons. Pubert, now restored to his normally pale and mustachioed self, escapes from his crib with a knife and reaches the family via a series of improbable events. As Debbie lowers the switch to electrocute the Addamses, Pubert connects two loose wires, rerouting the electrical current through her instead, destroying her in spectacular fashion. All that remains are a pile of ashes, her shoes, and her credit cards—the means of the family's salvation. Some time later, the Addamses and their relatives gather to celebrate Pubert's first birthday, with Joel also attending. Fester laments Debbie's loss, but soon becomes smitten with Dementia, a new nanny that Cousin Itt and his wife Margaret Alford have hired for their child. Out in the family graveyard, Joel attempts to ask Wednesday out by asking about having a future with a husband, though she turns him down. She then tells him Debbie was a sloppy husband killer, and that Wednesday would have scared her husband to death and made sure not to be caught. As he lays flowers on Debbie's grave, a hand emerges from the earth and grabs him, prompting Wednesday to smile as he screams.",

    "title": "Passage to Zarahemla",
    "plot": "The story begins with its focus on a group of hunters illegally hunting game out in the woods. Originally thought to be dead, the hunter's target springs back to life and flees into the heavy brush and trees. Determined not to let the game suffer, one of the hunters decides to pursue the elk in its flight. After some amount of exploration he finds his elk...hanging over a branch, shot by an arrow. Hearing noises he turns around to an arrow shot at him and screams. Kerra and Brock are introduced to the story line at their mother's funeral. With their father having apparently disappeared for some unknown reason years ago, their mother recently dying, and no other known relatives within the area, the two are set to become wards of the state. In an effort to keep the two together, Kerra decides that they must pack up their belongings and escape before the return of the social worker assigned to their case. Brock, having prior association with a local gang and a criminal record, assists his sister in stealing the social worker's vehicle. The two drive off in a fury in an effort to escape. Remembering a relative from early on in her childhood, Kerra plots a course for Leeds, Utah, a small LDS rich community in the southern part of the state. Arriving at their aunt and uncle's house, the two concoct a story indicating that they are traveling across the country to meet up with their mother who had recently acquired a new place of employment. With the stolen car having problems, the pair is unable to travel any further until it is fixed, and are offered a place to stay until repairs are completed. Shortly after their arrival, Kerra is confronted by her cousins with stories from her early childhood days. These stories recall \"strange noises\" in the woods behind their house and dealings with an \"imaginary\" being whom Kerra had termed to be \"Kid Donni.\" One night after the siblings arrival, an earthquake shakes the area with the epicenter believed to be near the property of their Aunt Corrine and Uncle Drew. Following the quake, Kerra is reunited with her \"imaginary\" childhood friend Kiddoni, who is in reality a noted being from the Book of Mormon. The earthquake is revealed to have caused a \"rift\" in time - allowing Kerra contact with the ancient Nephite peoples and their adversaries, and allowing Kiddoni and his people to cross the time gap into the modern world. As the story progresses, the time portal gap expands and eventually allows the Nephite and Gadianton armies to exit the past near the Whitman's home. Brock on the other hand is unaware of this time rift and eventually finds himself captured by the Gadianton armies. It is at this time that he comes into contact with a scraggly-bearded individual from \"modern\" times named Chris. Meanwhile, during their escape from California, Brock had been given a bag by a former gang-member to take out of the area, which is later revealed to be a bag full of illegal drugs. Upon realizing who was in possession of the bag, the gang leader decides to make a trip to the small Utah community to recover the bag. Near the end of the story the two worlds clash as the rift in time grows very large. The Gadianton army crosses the time border into the present day in an effort to find food for their armies. Through sheer coincidence Chris and Brock reunite with Kerra near the Whitman home, where it is revealed that Chris is the siblings father, who had disappeared during a hunting trip many years earlier. A major Nephite-Gadianton battle eventually ensues near the Whitman home while the trio of family retreats into hiding. Shortly thereafter, another quake hits the area and the division between the time periods is restored. Kerra is heartbroken at not getting to say goodbye to her Nephite friend, but both families are happy that they were kept safe and that father and children were reunited again.",

    "title": "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial",
    "plot": "A race of diminutive aliens visit Earth at night to gather plant specimens in a California forest. One of them, fascinated by the distant lights of a neighborhood, separates from the group, before U.S. government agents arrive and chase the startled creature. The aliens are forced to depart before the agents can find them, leaving their lone member behind. While the agents search the forest, the creature takes shelter in a shed belonging to the family of ten-year-old Elliott Taylor. Initially scared by the creature, who runs away, Elliott spends the following day leaving a trail of Reese's Pieces to lure the alien back to the Taylor's home, where he hides the creature in his room. The following morning, Elliott feigns illness to stay off school and play with the creature, whom he dubs E.T. Elliott eventually introduces E.T. to his older brother, Michael, and five-year-old sister Gertie, who agree to keep E.T. hidden from their hardworking single mother, Mary. When the children ask about his origins, E.T. displays telekinetic abilities by levitating several balls to represent his planetary system, and later demonstrates other extraordinary abilities by reviving a dead chrysanthemum and instantly healing a cut on Elliott's finger. As Elliott and the creature begin to bond, they start to share thoughts and emotions, the two being simultaneously startled when E.T. accidentally opens an umbrella in a different room. At school, Elliott becomes intoxicated because, at home, E.T. is drinking beer and watching television. Sensing E.T.'s desire to be rescued, Elliott impulsively frees the frogs about to be vivisected in his biology class, inspiring the other children to follow his lead, and romantically kisses a girl he likes because E.T. is watching John Wayne kiss Maureen O'Hara in The Quiet Man (1952); Elliott is sent to the principal's office for his disruptive behavior. Inspired by a Buck Rogers comic strip, depicting the character calling for help with a communication device, E.T. builds a makeshift device to \"phone home\", using various parts around the Taylor home. E.T. also learns to speak English, and requests the children's help to build the device. They agree to help find the missing components, unaware that agents are covertly searching for the alien. On Halloween, the children disguise E.T. as a ghost and Elliott sneaks E.T. into the forest, where they set up the device to call E.T.'s people. Elliott begs E.T. to stay on Earth with him, before falling asleep and waking alone in the forest the next day. Elliott returns home to his worried family, while Michael searches for E.T., finding him pale and weakened in a culvert. He takes him home, where Elliott is also growing weaker, and reveals the creature to Mary just before government agents invade and quarantine the house. The lead agent, Keys, asks for Elliott's help to save E.T., stating that meeting aliens was his childhood dream and he considers E.T's arrival a genuine miracle. However, E.T. dies while Elliott rapidly recovers. Left alone to say goodbye, Elliott tells E.T. that he loves him, so E.T.'s heart begins to glow and he is revived and restored to health. E.T. tells Elliott that his people are returning for him. Elliott and Michael flee with E.T. on their bikes, flanked by Michael's friends who help them evade the pursuing authorities. Heading towards a roadblock, E.T. levitates the boys to safety and lands them in the forest. E.T.'s ship arrives, and he says goodbye to Michael and Gertie, who gifts him the chrysanthemum he previously revived. Elliott tearfully asks E.T. to stay, but E.T. places his glowing finger on Elliott's head and tells him that he will always be there. The children, Mary, and Keys observe as the ship blasts off into space, leaving a rainbow in the sky.",

    "plot": "After Columbia University parapsychology professors Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz, and Egon Spengler experience their first encounter with a ghost at the New York Public Library, the university dean dismisses the credibility of their paranormal-focused research and fires them. The trio responds by establishing \"Ghostbusters\", a paranormal investigation and elimination service operating out of a disused firehouse. They develop high-tech nuclear-powered equipment to capture and contain ghosts, although business is initially slow. Following a paranormal encounter in her apartment, cellist Dana Barrett visits the Ghostbusters. She recounts witnessing a demonic dog-like creature in her refrigerator utter a single word: \"Zuul\". Ray and Egon research Zuul and details of Dana's building while Peter inspects her apartment and unsuccessfully attempts to seduce her. The Ghostbusters are hired to remove a gluttonous ghost from the Sedgewick Hotel. Having failed to properly test their equipment, Egon warns the group that crossing the energy streams of their proton pack weapons could cause a catastrophic explosion. They capture the ghost and deposit it in an ecto-containment unit under the firehouse. Supernatural activity rapidly increases across the city and the Ghostbusters become famous; they hire a fourth member, Winston Zeddemore, to cope with the growing demand. Suspicious of the Ghostbusters, Environmental Protection Agency inspector Walter Peck asks to evaluate their equipment, but Peter rebuffs him. Egon warns that the containment unit is nearing capacity and supernatural energy is surging across the city. Peter meets with Dana and informs her that Zuul was a demigod worshipped as a servant to \"Gozer the Gozerian\", a shapeshifting god of destruction. Upon returning home, Dana is possessed by Zuul; a similar entity possesses her neighbor, Louis Tully. Peter arrives and finds the possessed Dana/Zuul claiming to be \"the Gatekeeper\". Louis is brought to Egon by police officers and claims that he is \"Vinz Clortho, the Keymaster\". The Ghostbusters agree that they must keep the pair separated. The next morning, Peck returns with law enforcement and city workers to have the Ghostbusters arrested and their containment unit deactivated, causing an explosion that releases the captured ghosts. Louis/Vinz escapes in the confusion and makes his way to the apartment building to join Dana/Zuul. In jail, Ray and Egon reveal that Ivo Shandor, leader of a Gozer-worshipping cult in the early 20th century, designed Dana's building to function as an antenna to attract and concentrate spiritual energy to summon Gozer and bring about the apocalypse. Faced with supernatural chaos across the city, the Ghostbusters convince the mayor to release them. The Ghostbusters travel to a hidden temple located on top of the building as Dana/Zuul and Louis/Vinz open the gate between dimensions and transform into demonic dogs. Gozer appears as a woman and attacks the Ghostbusters, then disappears when they attempt to retaliate, with its disembodied voice demanding the Ghostbusters \"choose the form of the destructor\". Ray inadvertently recalls a beloved corporate mascot from his childhood, and Gozer reappears as a gigantic Stay Puft Marshmallow Man that begins destroying the city. Against his earlier advice, Egon instructs the team to cross their proton energy streams at the dimensional gate. The resulting explosion destroys Gozer's avatar, banishing it back to its dimension, and closes the gateway. The Ghostbusters then rescue Dana and Louis from the wreckage and are welcomed on the street as heroes.",

Seeing Michael's potential, their adoptive father and hospital director Nicholas arranges for Michael to attend medical school in New York while he focuses on caring for Milo. 25 years later, Michael publicly declines a Nobel Prize for his work with artificial blood. His colleague Martine Bancroft discovers he has secretly captured dozens of vampire bats from Costa Rica in the hope of splicing their genes with his own to cure his condition. Michael receives funding from Milo to outfit a private mercenary vessel in international waters with his equipment. While the cure works, it transforms Michael into a vampire who kills and drains the crew of their blood after they attack him out of fear. Once his bloodlust subsides and he regains his senses, a horrified Michael erases all CCTV footage of his experiment before contacting authorities and jumping overboard. Michael returns to New York and discovers he now has superhuman strength, speed, and echolocation, with his vampire bats treating him as one of their own. To control his bloodlust, he subsists on his artificial blood as it gradually ceases to satisfy his needs. FBI agents Simon Stroud and Al Rodriguez investigate Michael's victims and deduce his involvement. Milo learns that Michael is cured but becomes furious when Michael refuses to cure him as well. While checking on a hospitalized Martine, Michael finds a dead nurse, drained of her blood. Believing he was responsible, he attempts to escape before being arrested by Stroud. In prison, he is visited by Milo and realizes Milo took his cure and killed the nurse. Michael escapes to confront him. An unrepentant Milo urges Michael to embrace his powers as he has. Unwilling to hurt his brother, Michael flees. Michael meets Martine, acquires a new lab, and develops an antibody against vampirism to stop Milo; he also plans to use it on himself. Stroud and Rodriguez find footage of one of Milo's attacks and, believing Michael's vampirism to be spreading, release it to the media. Nicholas recognizes Milo and pleads with him to stop. Angered by Nicholas' perceived preference for Michael, Milo mortally wounds him; Michael arrives too late to save him while Milo also mortally wounds Martine. Martine dies in Michael's arms, forcing him to drink her blood. Michael summons an army of bats to restrain Milo and inject the antibody. Milo dies and Michael flies off with the bats, mourning his loved ones and embracing his identity as a vampire. Unbeknownst to him, Martine is resurrected, having ingested a drop of Michael's blood as he fed on her. In two mid-credits scenes, Adrian Toomes is transported to Michael's universe from his own.

    "plot": "In Ancient Greece, the gods Zeus and Hera have a son named Hercules. While the other gods are joyful, Zeus' wicked brother Hades plots to overthrow Zeus and rule Mount Olympus. Through the Fates, Hades learns that in eighteen years, a planetary alignment will allow him to free the Titans to conquer Olympus, but only if Hercules does not interfere. Hades sends his minions, Pain and Panic, to murder Hercules, providing them with a potion that can strip a god of immortality. The two kidnap the baby and feed him the potion, but a married farmer couple pass nearby, causing the demons to flee before Hercules could drink every last drop; therefore he is only stripped of immortality but retains his god-like strength. The couple adopt Hercules and Pain and Panic decide not to report their failure to Hades. Years later, the teenage Hercules becomes an outcast for his inability to control his strength. Wondering about his origins, he decides to visit the Temple of Zeus for answers. There, a statue of Zeus comes to life and reveals all to Hercules, telling him that he can earn back his godhood by becoming a \"true hero.\" Zeus sends Hercules and his forgotten childhood friend Pegasus to the satyr Philoctetes (\"Phil\") who is known for training heroes. After completing the training, Phil and Hercules travel to Thebes, so he can prove himself there as a hero. On the way, they meet Megara (\"Meg\"), a sarcastic damsel whom Hercules saves from the centaur Nessus. Unbeknownst to Hercules, Meg is Hades' slave due to selling her soul to him to save her boyfriend, who eventually left her for another woman. When Meg mentions Hercules to Hades, he realizes Pain and Panic's failure and plots to finish off Hercules properly. Hades stages an accident with the disguised Pain and Panic to lure Hercules into a fight with the Hydra. Hercules defeats the monster, earning the respect and admiration of the Thebans. He defeats many other monsters afterward, each of them sent by Hades, and becomes a celebrated hero. However, Zeus tells him that he is not yet a \"true\" hero but refuses to explain what that means. Saddened and frustrated, Hercules spends a day out with Meg, during which they fall in love with each other. Realizing this, Hades, on the eve of his takeover, holds Meg hostage and offers her freedom in exchange for Hercules surrendering his strength. On the condition that Meg will be unharmed, Hercules accepts but is heartbroken after learning that Meg was working for Hades all along. Hades unleashes the Titans, who defeat the gods on Olympus, while the Cyclops goes to Thebes to kill Hercules. Hercules uses his wits to defeat the Cyclops. During the battle, Meg is mortally injured while saving Hercules from a falling pillar. This breaks Hades's deal, so Hercules regains his strength. Hercules and Pegasus fly to Olympus, free the gods and vanquish the Titans, but Meg dies from her injuries. To recover Meg's soul, Hercules goes to the underworld and risks his life by leaping into the River Styx. This act restores his godhood and immortality, so he is able to reach Meg's soul and climb out alive. Hercules punches Hades into the Styx, and he is dragged to its depths by vengeful souls. After Hercules revives Meg, he is summoned to Olympus, where Zeus and Hera welcome him home, saying he has proven himself a \"true hero\" through the \"strength of his heart\". However, rather than joining the gods, Hercules chooses to remain with Meg, living on Earth as a demigod. Returning to Thebes, they watch Zeus form a constellation in Hercules' honor, much to Phil's happiness.",

    "plot": "In 19th-century Norway, the Royal Postmaster General has enrolled his son, Jesper Johansen, into the Royal Postman Academy. Jesper deliberately underperforms in his training, intending on returning to his privileged lifestyle. Jesper's father gives him an ultimatum, assigning him as the postman of the distant, northern island town of Smeerensburg and tasking him with establishing a post office there and posting 6,000 letters within a year. If Jesper fails, he will be cut off from the family's fortune. Jesper finds Smeerensburg comprised almost entirely by two feuding familial clans, the Ellingboes and the Krums, who have been in conflict with each other since the Stone Age. Desperately seeking letters from the townsfolk to no avail, Jesper finds an isolated house far outside of town, discovering it to be filled with handmade toys and inhabited by an elderly, reclusive woodsman named Klaus. Terrified by Klaus' imposing appearance, Jesper flees, leaving behind a drawing from one of Smeerensburg's Krum children. Klaus forces Jesper to enter the boy’s home to secretly deliver a toy, which delights the child. Word of the toy delivery spreads to the other children, who go to Jesper the next day believing they will receive a toy if they send Klaus a letter. Jesper capitalizes on the idea to make progress on his goal and asks Klaus if he can donate his toys; Klaus reluctantly agrees, provided they operate at night and Jesper continues to deliver the toys in secret. The Krum boy's toy leads him to play with an Ellingboe girl, much to their clans’ outrage. As more children write letters to Klaus, Jesper tells a boy who had earlier ridiculed him that Klaus knows whenever any child misbehaves and only gives toys to good children. This prompts the children to perform acts of kindness, which gradually inspire the rest of the townsfolk to end their ancient dispute and make Smeerensburg a happy town. The children ask bitter teacher-turned-fishmonger Alva to teach them to read and write so they can send letters; her faith restored, she uses her escape savings to reopen her school. Noticing that Klaus's toy supply is running out, Jesper tries persuading Klaus to make more toys in time for Christmas, but Klaus refuses; when Jesper happens upon a keepsake of Klaus's late wife Lydia, Klaus forces him away. Motivated by Márgu, a Sámi girl who can't write or speak in Norwegian, Jesper works with Alva to help Márgu write a letter asking for a sled, which he then attempts to build alone. Seeing Jesper's effort, Klaus reconciles with him and the two finish the sled. Upon delivering it and seeing Márgu's joy, Jesper is genuinely moved. Klaus reveals he had made the toys for the children he and Lydia hoped to have but could not conceive before she grew sick and died. He agrees to the Christmas plan, and Márgu arrives with the rest of her people to help. As the town and Jesper's relationship with Alva flourish, Jesper finds himself conflicted about whether to leave Smeerensburg. Meanwhile, family elders Aksel Ellingboe and Tammy Krum form a temporary truce to stop Jesper and Klaus so the families can resume their feud. Together, they discover Jesper's initial motive and forge enough letters to meet well over his target. Jesper's father arrives on Christmas Eve to congratulate his son, inadvertently revealing Jesper's scheme to his friends. Just before they leave town, Jesper's father notices his son's remorse; after a private talk, he allows Jesper to stay. Jesper tries to stop the elders and their angry mob from destroying the Christmas toys, resulting in a chase during which Aksel's daughter Magdalone and Tammy's son Olaf fall in love. Tammy seemingly destroys the toys; however, Alva and Klaus had already replaced the toys with decoys after the town's children warned them of the mob's ambush. Still, Jesper's actions have redeemed him to Klaus and Alva, and they then deliver the Christmas presents to the town. Magdalone and Olaf are married, ending their families' feud much to the elders' annoyance. Jesper marries Alva and they raise two children. He and Klaus continue to deliver presents in Smeerensburg and beyond for eleven years. On the twelfth year, Klaus mysteriously disappears. Every subsequent Christmas Eve, Jesper waits for Klaus, who returns every year to deliver toys across the world.",

    "plot": "In 1964, an expecting Ed and Lorraine Warren investigate a haunting involving an antique mirror at a curio shop. Lorraine collapses upon seeing a vision of an entity and her unborn child, and goes into labor. Ed speeds Lorraine to the hospital, but the baby is stillborn. However, Lorraine's prayers revive the baby, whom she names Judy. Twenty-two years later, the Smurl family moves to West Pittston, Pennsylvania. Jack and Janet Smurl share the home with Jack's parents, Mary and John, along with their four daughters: Dawn, Heather, and twins Carin and Shannon and their dog, Simon. For Heather's confirmation ceremony, John gifts her the antique mirror. During dinner, a kitchen ceiling light suddenly crashes down, narrowly missing Heather. Due to Ed's worsening heart condition, the Warrens retire from their investigations but continue giving lectures, which are now sparsely attended. While at dinner, Judy, who has become increasingly sensitive to psychic visions, has an episode and begins to panic. Using a rhyme created while Judy was a little girl, Lorraine helps her calm down and reminds her to always shut herself off from the supernatural. Dawn and Heather attempt to dispose of the mirror, but the family continues to be terrorized by three entities: an elderly woman, a younger woman, and a man wielding an axe. Exhausted, the family shares their story with the press in the hope of finding help, which attracts the interest of Father Gordon. Judy's boyfriend, Tony, proposes to Judy during Ed's birthday party, which she accepts. Unable to obtain the Warrens' help, Father Gordon goes to the Diocese of Scranton to seek help for the Smurls. The demon attacks Gordon at the diocese and induces him to commit suicide. At Father Gordon's funeral, Judy learns from a vision that he died while investigating the Smurls' haunting. She secretly leaves for Pennsylvania to investigate, and Lorraine has a vision that warns her about Judy. Ed, Lorraine, and Tony are led to the Smurls, and Judy convinces her reluctant parents to help. Lorraine discovers that the three spirits are of a husband who had killed his wife and her mother, but they are being controlled by the demon. The demon tricks Judy into the attic, where she is attacked, causing her to fall down the stairs. Ed and Lorraine discover the mirror and realize it is the demon from their first investigation. Certain that the demon is hunting Judy, they decide to transport the mirror back to their home, where it can be contained. Judy suddenly falls ill as Ed, Jack and Tony attempt to remove the mirror from the house, but they fail. The demon possesses Judy and causes Ed to have a cardiac episode while Lorraine is attacked in the basement. Tony rescues Lorraine, and Ed recovers. The possessed Judy, now in the attic, attempts to hang herself but is cut down by Ed. Lorraine again uses prayer to revive Judy, and the demon attacks them. Ed is unable to exorcise the mirror, and Lorraine resolves to tell Judy to embrace her psychic abilities. With Judy's help, the Warrens destroy the mirror. The Smurls live in the house for three more years without further hauntings, and the remains of the mirror are kept within the Warrens' occult museum. Sometime later, Judy walks down the aisle with Ed during her wedding to Tony. On the eve of the wedding, Ed and Lorraine embrace, and Lorraine shares a vision that she has about their future, excited to live the peaceful life they have always wanted.",

    "plot": "In the town of Maybrook, Pennsylvania, 17 children from one third-grade class suddenly run from their homes at 2:17 a.m. and disappear. Only one student, Alex Lilly, remains. The community suspects their teacher, Justine Gandy, is involved, and Principal Marcus Miller places her on leave. Ostracized, Justine relapses into alcoholism and starts an affair with her ex-boyfriend, police officer Paul Morgan. Concerned for Alex's wellbeing, Justine follows him home. After noticing his windows covered with newspaper and spotting his parents sitting motionless in the dark, she urges Marcus to perform a wellness check. While watching Alex's house, Justine falls asleep in her car; Alex's mother enters the car and cuts a lock of Justine's hair. Archer Graff, the father of the missing child Matthew, begins his own investigation, frustrated with the police's progress. After reviewing security camera footage of Matthew and another child, he notices that their paths converge but cannot determine where. Justine and Archer dream about the children and a mysterious elderly woman with clown-like makeup. While on patrol, Paul arrests James, a vagrant drug addict, for attempted burglary. When Paul accidentally pricks himself on a syringe while searching James, he assaults him. Realizing his car's camera recorded the assault, he releases him. James burgles Alex's house and finds Alex's parents and the missing children in the basement in a catatonic state. He attempts to report his findings to the police in hopes of earning the $50,000 reward, but Paul spots him and chases him away. James flees into the woods, spots the mysterious woman, and hides in his tent. He is caught by Paul and tells him where the children are. Paul drives to Alex's house, leaving James handcuffed in the car while he investigates. Hours later, Paul emerges and drags James inside. Marcus is visited at school by the mysterious woman, who introduces herself as Alex's aunt Gladys and explains that she has become the family's caretaker after Alex's parents fell ill. Marcus insists on meeting Alex's parents. Gladys visits Marcus and his husband Terry at their home and performs a ritual with a ribbon stolen from Marcus and locks of Terry and Justine's hair. She enchants Marcus, forcing him to kill Terry and pursue Justine. Marcus attacks Justine at a gas station, interrupting an argument between her and Archer, and is fatally hit by a car when he pursues her. Archer apologizes to Justine for his hostility and shares his findings with her. Justine realizes that the children were all running toward Alex's house. In a flashback, Gladys enchants Alex's parents and says she will have them attack each other if he tells others her secret. She has Alex bring home a possession from each of his classmates so she can enchant them and draws them to the house so she can keep them in the basement and feed off their life force. As Archer and Justine enter Alex's house, they are attacked by an enchanted Paul and James. Justine takes Paul's gun and shoots them both dead. When Archer searches for Matthew in the basement, Gladys enchants him and has him attack Justine. Alex evades his bewitched parents and replicates Gladys's spell using a strand of hair from her wig. The children emerge from the basement, chase Gladys around the neighborhood, and tear her apart. Her death frees her victims, though all but Archer remain catatonic. Alex moves out of town to stay with a different aunt, and the children are reunited with their parents, with some having learned how to speak again.",

    "plot": "Millie Wilson gets a job teaching elementary school English and moves to the countryside with her longtime boyfriend, aspiring musician Tim Brassington, who has been emotionally distant since the recent passing of his parents. Shortly before the move, Millie proposes to Tim at a going-away party held by their friends but he hesitates to respond, embarrassing her. While hiking near their new home, they fall into an underground cave during a rainstorm and decide to camp inside for the night. Tim drinks from a pool of water but Millie refuses. Tim recalls traumatic details of the night he found his mother in bed with his father's decaying corpse. Upon waking up the next morning, Tim and Millie find their legs partially stuck together but dismiss the incident after separating. Tim begins to experience episodes where he is inexplicably physically drawn to Millie, confusing and frustrating them both. He visits a doctor, who dismisses his symptoms as panic attacks and prescribes him muscle relaxant pills before mentioning that a local couple, Simon and Keri, recently went missing. Millie's co-worker Jamie McCabe shows up at their home to welcome them to the neighborhood, and she invites him in for dinner. The couple recounts their experience at the cave, which Jamie explains was a New Age church before it caved in. Millie drops Tim off at the train station for a gig, but Tim experiences another episode and drags himself to Millie's workplace. An outraged Millie confronts him in a bathroom stall, whereupon they have sex, after which their genitals become stuck together. After they painfully force themselves to separate, Jamie spots them. Millie later visits Jamie's house to apologize and Jamie offers her some water, which she drinks. She opens up about some of the problems she and Tim have been facing in their relationship. Jamie relates Aristophanes' theory of the nature and origin of eros and encourages her not to let go of her \"other half\", then reminisces on his relationship with his seemingly deceased husband. Millie abruptly leaves after spotting a disoriented Tim outside. Using exif data from their social media photos, Tim discovers that Simon and Keri visited the same cave he and Millie fell into after noticing the same symbols surrounding the cave, and unsuccessfully tries to convince Millie that the two of them may suffer whatever fate Simon and Keri did. That night, both Tim and Millie are supernaturally drawn together, causing their bodies to contort in unnatural ways until their arms become fused. They manage to prevent further fusion after consuming Tim's pills in a panic before passing out. Tim awakens tied to a chair, where Millie saws through their fused limb. Millie decides to drive them to the hospital, but realizes she has left her keys at Jamie's house. Tim returns to the cave and finds Simon and Keri partially fused together as a grotesque humanoid with the Simon half having been stabbed in the neck. Millie enters Jamie's house and finds a television playing the wedding tape of two men she does not recognize, and then a ritual in which the men fuse together. Jamie, revealed to be the result of said fusion, promises that they are happier after \"becoming whole\" and implores Millie to complete the fusion process with Tim. When she resists, he cuts her arm the same way his constituents had their arms cut in the tape before she escapes. Millie reunites with Tim in their driveway. He mentions the creature he saw in the cave, deducing that it was a result of both parties resisting the fusion process, resulting in the Simon half having been killed mid-fusion, and proclaiming he does not want to end up like them. He prepares to slit his own throat to save Millie, despite her pleading with him not to. Her wound from Jamie nearly causes her to fatally bleed out, but Tim saves her by fusing his arm to her wound. Accepting their fate, the two affirm their mutual love and slow dance to \"2 Become 1\", embracing as they fuse into a singular being. That weekend, Millie's parents arrive for a visit, and they are greeted by the fused Millie and Tim, a seemingly normal, androgynous person.",

The children include controversial anthropologist Jared York, embattled pharmaceutical CEO Rachel York, struggling actress Ashley York, recovering addict Noah York, and Rachel's young daughter Mia. A family argument ensues when Charles announces that he and Dawn willingly enlisted in the Department of Citizen Strategy's (D.O.C.S.) euthanasia program. However, Dawn later sneaks out and flees after changing her mind. Bob from the Department of Citizen Strategy arrives with armed D.O.C.S. agents. Another heated argument breaks out when they learn that Charles scheduled his euthanasia for that same evening with everyone present. With Dawn now absent, Charles attempts to reschedule his appointment. Bob presents Charles with cancellation documents that would freeze the family's assets and publicly out Charles as a traitor so he chooses to go ahead with it. Following Charles's death, Bob informs the family that legally, he must collect a second body as originally promised. Bob takes Mia, who is exempt from euthanasia because she is a minor, outside while the four Yorks are given two hours to decide which one of them will die. Jared suggests Noah to die because he is adopted and a disappointing drain on the family who killed a woman in a car accident. Rachel attempts to stab Noah, but he fights back. Several violent confrontations occur as Noah fights to physically defend himself against his siblings. Eventually, they all restrain him. Having received a text from him, Noah's girlfriend Grace Dawson arrives at the house. Panicking over the situation, Grace causes a commotion that ends when a D.O.C.S. agent shoots her dead. Noah breaks free and stabs, chokes, and fights back against his siblings. Realizing they are close to killing each other, Rachel volunteers to be euthanized. Jared contends he should be the volunteer because he abandoned his first wife and his son Lucas. Noah brings everyone together by proposing to kill Bob instead. The siblings lure Bob and the D.O.C.S. agents into the house where they are disarmed and taken hostage. However, Ashley dies of the injuries she sustained while struggling with Noah. The siblings euthanize the agent who shot Grace. Bob admits that Dawn was taken into custody and is now being held at D.O.C.S. headquarters. Bob continues to desperately bargain and makes threats as Noah prepares to inject him with the euthanasia drug. The camera cuts to black. Some time later, Jared, Rachel, Mia, Dawn, and Jared's son Lucas attend a piano concert performed by Noah, who was once a promising virtuoso. A bruised and battered Bob appears in a television commercial where government propaganda claims Ashley and Grace enlisted to be voluntarily euthanized.",

    "plot": "In 1969, Iris Campbell and her boyfriend Paul attend the grand opening of the Sky View, a high-rise restaurant tower. Iris has a premonition of a chain of events that causes the tower to collapse, killing everyone inside. She warns the attendees and prevents the collapse but, in doing so, disrupts Death's design. Fifty-five years later, Iris and Paul's granddaughter, college student Stefani Reyes, is plagued by recurring nightmares of the averted accident and returns home seeking answers. She is greeted by her father, Marty, and younger brother Charlie. The siblings visit their uncle Howard, aunt Brenda, and cousins Erik, Julia, and Bobby. When Stefani asks about Iris, Howard explains that he and Stefani's mother, Darlene, were raised in an overprotective, isolated environment, contributing to family tensions and Darlene's absence. Brenda helps Stefani find letters from Iris that lead to a fortified cabin where Iris now lives, terminally ill with cancer. Iris recounts the Sky View incident and explains that, after she prevented the collapse, Death began taking the lives of the survivors in the order they should have died, along with their descendants. After Paul's death, Iris documented Death's actions in a notebook to protect her family. Stefani doubts her grandmother's story and tries to leave, but Iris follows her outside, gives her the notebook, and allows herself to be impaled by a weather vane to prove her claims. At Iris's funeral, Darlene returns, but Stefani resents her absence since she abandoned her and Charlie during their childhood. Reading the notebook, Stefani finds a reference to \"JB\", who discovered someone who defeated Death. During a family barbecue, a chain of events kills Howard with his lawnmower in front of the family. Following Howard's funeral, Stefani tries to warn everyone that Death is coming, but they are reluctant to believe her. A fire breaks out at Erik's tattoo shop, but he survives thanks to his leather clothing. The next day, Stefani and Charlie attempt to protect Erik, believing he is next, but Julia is crushed by a garbage truck's compactor instead. A shame-fueled Brenda discloses that Erik was the product of an affair and is not part of Iris's bloodline, explaining why he was spared. Darlene suggests tracking down \"JB\", who turns out to be William Bludworth. Present at the Sky View as a child with his mother and the last to die in Iris's original premonition, he explains that Iris found him years later, and they learned about Death's rules together. He explains to the family that there are two ways to defeat Death: taking another life or being clinically dead and then resuscitated, citing Kimberly Corman as an example. Bludworth departs, expecting his own cancer to claim him after Iris's bloodline ends, and wishes the family luck. Erik persuades Bobby to attempt the second strategy by triggering a fatal allergic reaction with nuts and then reviving him. The plan backfires when a malfunctioning MRI machine rips out Erik's piercings, pulls him in, and a wheelchair impales and crushes him before a coil from a vending machine launches into Bobby's head. Stefani, Charlie and Darlene drive to Iris's cabin to conceal Darlene from Death. They crash through the front gate, and Stefani's seat belt jams. The cabin explodes, sending the RV into the water, where Stefani begins to drown. Darlene saves Charlie before being bisected by a lamp post, and Charlie rescues and resuscitates Stefani. One week later, the father of Charlie's prom date, a physician, informs them that Stefani was never clinically dead because she was resuscitated before cardiac arrest. Moments later, a timber-carrying freight train derails nearby, and its cargo fatally crushes the siblings.",

    "plot": "In 2002, during the initial outbreak of the Rage virus, a young boy, Jimmy Crystal, flees his house in the Scottish Highlands as his family are attacked by the infected. He takes refuge in the local church with his father, a minister, but finds him praying in ecstasy, since he interprets the virus as a harbinger of the end times and the Day of Judgement. Jimmy's father bequeaths him a cross necklace and helps him to safety before submitting to the infected as they break in. Twenty-eight years after its second outbreak, the Rage virus has been eradicated from continental Europe, while the British Isles remain under indefinite quarantine with few survivors. A civilised community has subsisted on the holy island of Lindisfarne, defended naturally from Great Britain by a causeway that floods with the tide. Among them are Jamie, a scavenger, his wife, Isla, who has a mentally debilitating illness, and their 12-year-old son, Spike. Jamie and Spike cross to mainland Britain for a coming-of-age hunting ritual. They find an infected tied up and branded with the name \"Jimmy\", and escape a pack of infected led by an \"alpha\", an evolved infected that is stronger and more intelligent. They shelter overnight in the attic of a run-down cottage, where Spike observes foreign boats on quarantine patrol and a fire further inland. When the attic collapses, the alpha pursues Jamie and Spike across the partially inundated causeway until the village sentries kill it with a ballista. The village throws a party for Spike to celebrate his first kill. Spike is upset by Jamie's embellishment of his deeds, and discovers his affair with Rosie, the village schoolteacher. He discusses the fire with a family friend, Sam, who suggests it was Dr Ian Kelson, a former GP in exile. The next morning, Spike confronts Jamie over his unwillingness to seek medical care for Isla and his infidelity. Jamie insists that Kelson, whom he once witnessed burning corpses en masse, is too mentally unstable to help. Unconvinced, Spike escapes the island with Isla. Spike and Isla are rescued from a pack of infected by Swedish Navy seaman Erik Sundqvist, the sole survivor of a stranded NATO quarantine patrol boat. Isla discovers a pregnant infected and helps it deliver an uninfected baby girl. A paranoid Erik shoots the infected mother and threatens to kill Isla and Spike alongside the newborn if they do not let him kill it, but the alpha father appears and decapitates him. Dr Kelson appears and subdues the alpha, whom he has named Samson, with a blowgun and morphine-xylazine dart. Kelson leads Spike and Isla to a monument he has constructed out of cleaned human bones. He explains the funerary concept of memento mori and incorporates Erik's skull into the monument. Kelson examines Isla and deduces that she has advanced terminal cancer. Kelson consoles Spike advising him memento amoris – \"remember you must love\". Isla and Spike share their last moment together as she accepts her mortality and arranges for Kelson to euthanize her, after which he gives her skull to Spike to place at the top of the monument. When Samson infiltrates the sanctuary, Spike fends him off, saving Kelson's life. Kelson encourages Spike to go home with the infant. Instead, Spike leaves her at the village gate and returns to the mainland, still disillusioned. Jamie reads a note from Spike that reveals he has named the girl after Isla and promises he will return when he is ready. Jamie tries to follow but is blocked by the rising tide. Twenty-eight days later, Spike is rescued from a pack of infected by a group styled after the British media personality Jimmy Savile. He is greeted by their leader, the adult Jimmy Crystal, now bearing an inverted cross.",

    "plot": "In an alternate 20th century, the United States is a totalitarian military regime following a devastating war. The regime has established an annual event, The Long Walk, which aims to inspire patriotism and work ethic among the destitute, as the country is in the grips of a severe economic depression. Fifty teenage boys, one from each state, are chosen randomly, given water and rations, and must walk hundreds of miles nonstop while escorted by armed soldiers who also broadcast the event. Those who fall below 3 miles per hour (4.8 km/h) or stop walking receive up to three warnings before being executed. The Walk ends when there is only one survivor remaining, who receives a large cash prize and can have one wish fulfilled. Although the sign-up is technically voluntary, nearly all eligible young men do so every year in the hope of improving their families' lives. Raymond \"Ray\" Garraty is driven to the starting line near the Canadian border in Maine by his mother, Ginnie, who begs him to back out. Ray refuses and meets the other participants, including Peter \"Pete\" McVries, Billy Stebbins, Arthur \"Art\" Baker, Collie Parker, Gary Barkovitch, Hank Olson, and Richard Harkness. During the first day, Ray gets to know the other walkers and forms a close bond with Pete. \"The Major\", a mysterious official who also oversees the regimes' death squads, is in charge of escorting the walkers. A boy named Thomas Curley is the first to be killed, after he develops a charley horse in his leg. Barkovitch is shunned by the group for provoking another walker named Rank into attacking him, resulting in Rank's execution. As the walk continues, Pete says he wants to use his wish to improve the world. Ray wants his wish for a rifle to kill the Major as revenge for his father's execution over political opposition. Pete tries to talk Ray out of it, admits that he cannot have someone die to win, and will sit down once he has had enough. Over days, several walkers die, including Harkness, who was shot after breaking his ankle and walking on it for miles. Hank becomes delirious, tries to attack the soldiers, but they shoot him and let him bleed to death. After learning he was married, the boys vow to send money to his widow. Guilt over Rank's death and his exclusion from the pact leads Barkovitch to beg to join. Soon after Ray agrees, Barkovitch has a mental breakdown and stabs himself in the throat with a spoon. Only Ray, Pete, Stebbins, Art, and Collie remain. While walking through Ray's hometown of Freeport, he spots Ginnie and runs to her, apologizing for competing. He is almost killed for stepping off the road, but is saved by Pete. Collie, driven to insanity, manages to steal a rifle which he uses to shoot one of the soldiers and then himself. Art develops an internal hemorrhage and thanks Pete and Ray for being his friends before stopping. Stebbins, who has also fallen ill, reveals to Ray and Pete that he is one of the Major's many illegitimate sons, and he intended to use his wish to be accepted as his son. He tells the pair it was an honor to walk with them before stopping and allowing himself to be killed, leaving Ray and Pete as the final two walkers. After five days and well over 300 miles of walking, the pair arrives at another town, where a large crowd has gathered to see who will win. Pete sits down, only for Ray to pick him up and encourage him to keep going. He does so, only for Ray to stop walking instead. The Major personally executes Ray and congratulates Pete as the winner. When asked to state his wish, Pete asks for one of the soldier's rifle. Confused, but willing to accept the wish, the weapon is handed over, only for Pete to immediately turn it to the Major and shoot him dead. The crowd watches before Pete turns and aimlessly walks away.",

At the party, Danica receives a threatening note reading, \"I know what you did last summer.” The group suspects Teddy is responsible and confronts him, but he denies any involvement. That night, Danica's new fiancé Wyatt is hacked to death by a hook-wielding fisherman who resembles the now-deceased Ben. Convinced someone knows about the accident and is coming after them, the group decides to learn more about Ben. When Tyler shows Ava the location where Ben murdered sisters Elsa and Helen Shivers in 1997, the Fisherman ambushes them and murders Tyler before Ava wounds him and is able to escape. With the entire town wanting to avoid scaring away tourists, and knowing that the police will not believe them, the group seeks help from survivor Julie James, who assumes that the Fisherman has a personal connection to Sam. At a town hall meeting, Julie's ex-husband and Stevie's boss Ray Bronson accuses Grant of covering up the 1997 killings to boost the town's appeal. Ava, Milo, and Stevie learn that Sam's car belonged to town pastor Judah Gillespie. Teddy and Danica visit the cemetery and notice the graves of Barry Cox, Helen and Elsa Shivers, and Max Nuerick, the victims of the original 1997 killings. Danica notes that there are fresh flowers on Sam Cooper's grave, indicating someone had recently visited it. The Fisherman attacks Danica, but Teddy saves her and insists that everyone move to Danica's mansion. There, Milo is strangled by the Fisherman, who escapes with his corpse. Ava and Danica learn that Judah knew Sam, and report him to the police but are locked in an interrogation room for harassment instead. The Fisherman attacks and murders Teddy and Grant. After discovering the bodies of Milo, Teddy, and Grant, Ray urges the women to escape Southport on Teddy’s yacht. Meanwhile, police officers find Judah dead in his church, along with a photo of Sam and Stevie, revealing the latter to be the Fisherman. On the yacht, Stevie ambushes Ava and Danica, explaining that she and Sam became friends in rehab, and that they fell in love before his death, for which she now seeks revenge. As Ray arrives, Stevie stabs Danica and throws her overboard, but Ray shoots her off the boat. At his bar, Ray tends to a traumatized Ava, who notices he has an injury at the same spot she wounded the Fisherman, and realizes he is Stevie's accomplice. Julie learns this and rushes to the bar, where Ray attacks them. Ray reveals he followed Ben's footsteps and took Stevie as his partner to not only help her but to seek revenge on Southport for trying to cover up his life's ruin over the 1997 killings, while planning to frame Julie for his crimes. Before Ray can kill Julie, Ava fatally shoots him with a speargun. Danica survives and reunites with Ava at the hospital, where they learn that Stevie is still alive and jokingly agree to kill her. Julie receives a note reading, \"It isn't over\", and visits fellow survivor Karla Wilson to ask for her help to find the stalker.",

    "plot": "In 1968, renowned demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren investigate the Annabelle case, in which friends Debbie and Camilla have a possessed doll. They allowed a spirit, who claimed to be a seven-year-old girl named Annabelle Higgins, to possess the doll, and the hauntings became increasingly disturbing. The Warrens explain that the doll was never possessed; it was only a conduit for a demonic spirit whose goal was to possess one of the friends. Three years later, in 1971, Roger and Carolyn Perron move into a farmhouse in Harrisville, Rhode Island, with their five daughters: Andrea, Nancy, Christine, Cindy, and April. Their dog, Sadie, refuses to enter the house. The family discovers a boarded-up cellar in the house and paranormal events occur within the first few nights. Every clock in the house stops at 3:07 a.m. Carolyn awakens with new bruises each morning, and Sadie is found dead in the yard. Carolyn and Christine both encounter a malevolent spirit. Carolyn contacts the Warrens, who conduct an initial investigation, during which Lorraine, a clairvoyant, sees that a dark entity has latched on to the family so that even leaving the house will not free them. To gather evidence, they place cameras and bells around the house with the help of their assistant Drew Thomas and police officer Brad Hamilton. Research reveals that the house once belonged to an accused witch and Satanist named Bathsheba Sherman (a relative of Mary Towne Eastey), who sacrificed her week-old baby to the devil and killed herself in 1863 at 3:07 in the morning after cursing all who take her land. There have since been reports of numerous murders and suicides through the years in the houses that were built on the land. Bathsheba completely possesses Carolyn. In the cellar, Lorraine sees the spirit of a woman whom Bathsheba had possessed long ago and forced to kill her child, realizing she will force Carolyn to do the same. The Warrens conclude they have sufficient evidence to receive authorization from the Catholic Church to perform an exorcism, but Father Gordon explains that approval would have to come directly from the Vatican because the Perron family are not members of the church. The Warrens' daughter Judy is attacked by Bathsheba as a warning to the Warrens. The Perron family takes refuge at a motel, but Carolyn, possessed, takes Christine and April back to the house to kill them. Running out of time, Ed, Lorraine, and Brad tie Carolyn to a chair and Ed attempts the exorcism himself. Carolyn escapes and attempts to kill April; Lorraine is able to call to her by reminding her of a family memory, allowing Ed to complete the exorcism and condemn Bathsheba back to Hell. Returning home, Ed adds the haunted music box from the Perron home to their room of cursed artifacts that they have collected from past cases.",

    "plot": "After finding their father dead in the shower, 17-year-old Andy and his blind step-sister Piper are sent to live with Laura, an eccentric former counselor who also fosters a mute boy named Oliver. Andy quickly becomes unsettled by both Laura and Oliver's strange behavior. At the funeral, Laura persuades Andy to kiss the lips of his father's corpse, later stealing a lock of hair from the body. That night, Andy confides that he resents his father for being abusive toward him but affectionate toward Piper. Laura reflects on the death of her daughter Cathy, who was also blind and accidentally drowned in the backyard pool, saying she would give anything to hear Cathy call her \"mum\" again. The next day, Andy encourages Oliver to start writing on a notepad to communicate. Oliver starts to write before gnawing on a knife Andy had used to cut rockmelon. When Andy carries him across Laura's encircled property line to get help, Oliver begins to convulse and scream before uttering \"help me.\" Laura arrives and commands Andy to get inside, where he finds that Oliver has written the word \"bird\". Laura takes Oliver to her room and returns him to his mute state by rubbing his head in a circular motion before feeding him Andy's father's hair. That night, while showering, Andy hallucinates an apparition of his father, which warns him, \"She'll die in the rain.\" Shocked, Andy slips and is concussed. While Andy recovers in the hospital, Laura takes Piper to a padlocked shed, where Cathy's corpse is stored in a freezer, and dresses Piper in Cathy's clothes. It is revealed that Oliver is possessed by Tari, a demon Laura summoned through a resurrection ritual from a Russian VHS tape - the corpse of the deceased is fed to a possessed host, who then regurgitates the corpse and its lingering soul into the body of a person recently killed in the same manner as the one to be resurrected. Laura intends to drown Piper in the pool to replicate Cathy's death and use Oliver as a vessel to complete the ritual. Upon Andy's return, Laura uses his body spray and punches Piper while she sleeps, later framing Andy for the assault and accusing him of being dangerous like their father. After Andy leaves, Laura takes Piper to goalball practice so she will be out of the house while Laura prepares for the ritual. As Tari grows increasingly hungry and restless, Oliver trashes the house, bites Laura, and consumes inanimate objects and parts of his own body. Meanwhile, Andy goes to the foster agency, where he sees a poster for a missing child named Connor Bird; recognizing Connor as \"Oliver,\" he implores Wendy, their social worker, to investigate Laura. Andy leaves Piper a voicemail apologizing for keeping their father's abuse of him a secret from her, as well as warning her about Laura. Laura intercepts the message and frantically cleans the house to deceive Wendy during the visit. After Wendy inquires about Laura's injured arm and hears Andy calling for Wendy outside, Laura breaks down and confesses her plan to resurrect Cathy. Wendy escapes the house and follows Andy into the shed, where they discover Connor eating Cathy's corpse. As they attempt to leave, Laura runs them over with her car, instantly killing Wendy and severely injuring Andy, whom Laura then drowns in a rain puddle. Laura brings Piper home. Having eaten some of Andy's flesh, Connor speaks with Andy's voice to lure Piper, though she suspects something is amiss. She locks herself in the bathroom and finds Andy's body. Laura enters and explains the ritual. Piper fends her off and attempts to flee, but runs into a wall, knocking herself unconscious. Laura carries Piper to the pool and begins drowning her while Connor watches. Piper awakens and starts struggling. Laura releases Piper after she screams out \"mum.\" Laura tearfully apologizes, but Piper escapes and stumbles out onto the road, where she is rescued by a passing car. Connor steps past the circle boundary and collapses as Tari leaves his body, while police arrive to identify him. A guilt-stricken Laura carries Cathy's corpse into the pool and cradles it as police surround her.",

In an attempt to save the little boy, Arne invites the demon to enter his body instead of David's. Ed witnesses the demon enter Arne just as the demon causes Ed to suffer a heart attack. The following month, Ed wakes up at the hospital and reveals that he witnessed the demon enter Arne. After hallucinating a demonic entity attacking him, Arne murders his landlord by stabbing him 22 times. With the support of the Warrens, his case becomes the first American murder trial where demonic possession is claimed as a defense. The Warrens discover a witch's totem in the Glatzel home, through which a satanic curse is passed. Kastner, a former priest who had studied the Disciples of the Ram cult, tells them that an occultist had intentionally left the totem, resulting in a curse on the Glatzels and David's possession. When the Warrens receive notice that detectives from Danvers, Massachusetts found a similar totem in the death of Katie Lincoln, who was also stabbed 22 times, they travel there. The totem was found at the home of Katie's friend Jessica, who is missing. Lorraine learns through a vision that Jessica had murdered Katie while possessed before jumping to her death, which allows detectives to recover her body. She also witnesses the occultist attempting to make Arne kill himself but stops her, causing the occultist to become aware of the Warrens' presence. A book of Stregherian witchcraft states that for the curse to be lifted, the occultist's altar must be destroyed. Ed is affected by the curse when a totem is discovered in the Warren's house; he almost stabs Lorraine but is stopped by their assistant Drew. Kastner reveals that the occultist is in fact his daughter, Isla. He had secretly raised her in violation of the requirement of clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church. As he researched the occult, Isla grew fascinated by it and became an occultist. He leads Lorraine into the tunnels underneath the house, where her altar is but Isla kills her father, then curses Ed and Arne, causing Ed to try to kill Lorraine and Arne to try and kill himself. Ed regains his senses when Lorraine reminds him of their love, and destroys the altar, saving Arne as well. Isla is killed by the demon she'd summoned after failing to complete the curse. Ed places the cup from the altar in the Warrens' artifact room, along with the Valak painting and the Annabelle doll. Arne is convicted of manslaughter and serves a sentence of five years, marrying Debbie while in prison.",

    "plot": "The film starts with Kali Puja in an ancestral mansion in fictional village of Chandrapur in West Bengal. A woman gives birth during the puja, and it is announced that her baby is a boy. Then the midwife revealed that she is giving birth to his twin. The kali puja is being led by a woman. Joydev and his friends are watching the proceedings, his friends say he should have been leading the puja because he is the son of the sarpanch. Joydev says that this woman priestess was chosen because the Goddess Kali came to her in a dream. It is announced that the second twin is a girl. The father, the scion of zamindar family, takes the newborn daughter from the new mother despite her protests, to the priestess leading the puja for a sacrifice. The priestess leading the kali puja takes the baby girl to an altar on a rock in front of a huge haunted tree behind the house, and initiates the sacrifice of the infant with a huge sword. But she stops and says the Goddess Kali cannot ask for a baby girl's sacrifice. Then Joydev snatches the sword from her, and declaring it his right, sacrifices the girl. Forty years later, Ambika, her husband Shubankar, and their twelve-year-old daughter Shweta live a content life in Kolkata, West Bengal, India. It is revealed that Shubankar is same son who had a female twin forty years ago, and is contemplating when to reveal the truth of his family to his daughter. One day, Joydev (now an old man and also the village sarpanch), informs him that his father has died. Despite her pleading, Shubankar refuses to let his daughter accompany him, as she is stunned to learn she has a grandfather. Shubankar travels to Chandrapur, his ancestral village, to cremate his father and manage the family estate. He reveals to Joydev his desire to sell the property. While returning to Kolkata by car, Shubankar dies under mysterious and supernatural circumstances, in a fire accident as his car catches fire seemingly caused by a splinter from the roots of a tree (the same haunted tree where his twin was sacrificed) near their ancestral palatial home, which embeds in his shoe. Later, grief-stricken Ambika and Shweta travel to Chandrapur to finalize the sale of the ancestral property. There Shweta strikes a friendship with Deepika, the daughter of their home's caretaker. There she insists on visiting the haunted tree (the same tree behind her house). Initially, Deepika refuses but then goes along, despite being warned by all not to go, as rumor has it that there is demon (daitya) who resides on the tree. As Shweta approaches the tree, Ambika pulls her back, and then it is revealed that Deepika has had her first period (menstruation cycle). However, the mysterious disappearance of several village girls shortly after their first menstruation cycle, who are surprisingly returned unharmed, including Deepika, forces Ambika to stay back (she had initially planned to sell off the property and return to Kolkata at earliest) and investigate. She is helped by a police officer, Sarfaraz, who is unconvinced by rumors of daitya/demon and believes there is a different reason. Ambika and the police officer Sarfaraz investigate the disappearances. They take the girls who disappeared after their first menstruation cycle to the doctor, who is surprised that no girl has been harmed and shocked that all these girls no longer menstruate. Later, Ambika is handed over a manuscript belonging to Shubankar by the old servant (father of the current caretaker who was there when the twin sister was sacrificed). On reading the manuscript, she discovers that the village is haunted by an ancient curse tied to a blood daitya named Aamsaja. The legend involves human sacrifices, the Kali Puja ritual, and the haunted tree is believed to hold the malevolent daitya. It is revealed that the daitya is actually after Shweta, as it intends to procreate through her. Ambika tries to flee with her daughter but is stopped by the daitya Amsaja who uses the previously abducted girls to snatch Shweta. Ambika then takes the help of the police officer Sarfaraz who realises that it is Joydev who is committing the crimes. Then Joydev reveals that he is the human face of the demon Amsaja. Ambika then has a dream of Goddess Kali, and as a ritual, she decides to perform Kali Puja in the temple of her home, which is locked; (the puja is only performed when a person in the village has a dream of Goddess Kali, only then the temple doors are unlocked). As the influence of the demon, now infested in Joydev's body grows, Ambika channels the divine wrath of the Goddess Kali, undergoing a spiritual transformation and turning into a fierce matriarchal protector. Amsaja almost kills her, but she confronts the evil force in a final effort to save Shweta and the other missing girls and eliminates him. But it is revealed by an old priestess (the same woman who had a dream of Goddess Kali forty years ago) that her daughter Shweta was actually carrying the child of the daitya/demon Amsaja, and she must be sacrificed to stop the birth. Ambika reluctantly proceeds to sacrifice her own daughter for the greater good, but just before she kills her daughter, she is stopped by the old woman priestess, who says that she has passed the test Goddess Kali put her through and that the child inside her daughter was no more. During the end-credits scene, Vanraj, wearing his hoodie, baggy pants, and boots, is seen walking through the ashy remains of the forest, seemingly absorbing whatever was left of Amsaja's powers.",

During a seance, Lorraine is drawn into a vision where she encounters a demonic nun figure and witnesses Ed being impaled. One year later, the Hodgson family begins to experience strange occurrences in their home in the London borough of Enfield after Janet, the second-oldest of four children, plays with a ouija board. Janet sleepwalks and converses with the entity of an angry elderly man. When the media attempts to interview the family, Janet is possessed by the elderly man, Bill Wilkins, who previously lived and died in the house. The Warrens are requested to prove whether Janet's demonic possession is a hoax. Lorraine, fearful that her vision of Ed's death may become reality, has another vision of the demonic nun in which the demon says its name. She scratches the name into her Bible in a trance. While staying at the Hodgson residence, Ed and Lorraine consult other paranormal investigators, including Maurice Grosse and Anita Gregory, on the legitimacy of the case. Gregory presents video evidence of Janet wrecking the kitchen intentionally, thereby discrediting the haunting. Unsure of whether to believe the haunting is real or the family is lying for fame, Ed and Lorraine leave, only to soon discover that Wilkins' spirit is only a pawn being manipulated by the true demon, the nun, who is seeking to break Janet's will. Lorraine's abilities had been blocked by the nun, preventing her from grasping the truth of Janet's possession. The couple quickly return to the Hodgson residence and finds Janet possessed, standing at the window, ready to commit suicide. Ed grabs Janet but is close to falling. Lightning strikes the tree in the yard, turning it into the stump that impaled Ed in Lorraine's vision. Lorraine finds the Bible where she wrote the demon's name – Valak. She addresses the demon by its name, gaining dominion over it and successfully condemning it back to Hell. Janet is freed of her possession, and Lorraine pulls her and Ed to safety. After returning home, Ed adds an item to his and Lorraine's collection – a haunted \"Crooked Man\" zoetrope toy owned by Peggy's youngest child – placing it beside April Perron's music box and the Annabelle doll.",

While riding out into the ocean, Tucker remarks on how he survived a shark attack as a child, which scarred him and changed his view of the species. After the two participate in a cage dive, Tucker suddenly kills Greg and abducts Heather. At the Gold Coast, American drifter Zephyr reluctantly helps real estate agent Moses start his car. The two bond over their love of surfing and later have a one-night stand. Although Moses hopes their relationship turns into something romantic, Zephyr drives away later that night without him to surf. There, she encounters Tucker, who abducts her. Moses arrives at the surfing spot the next morning but finds no sign of Zephyr. The next day, Zephyr’s van is towed away, causing Moses to be suspicious of her whereabouts, and he begins to start looking for her. Zephyr awakens chained to a bed in a room where Heather is also being held. Upstairs, it is revealed that Tucker is holding the pair captive in his boat. Zephyr discovers he has done this to other women and is unsuccessful in attempting to lockpick her cuffs. That night, Tucker drugs Zephyr and Heather, and the two awaken on deck. Zephyr is strapped to a chair and watches helplessly as Heather is hoisted into the air by a harness and hovered over the water, which is filled with sharks lured by chum. Tucker sets up an old VHS camera to record as Heather is lowered into the water and devoured by sharks. It is revealed Tucker is a serial killer who has done this to multiple tourists. Zephyr manages to escape the room. While being chased on the deck, she throws his camera overboard in the scuffle before being recaptured. Furious, Tucker returns to land and docks his boat before going out to buy a new camera. Recognizing Tucker's van on a live webcam feed of the beach Zephyr vanished from, Moses goes to visit him, unaware he has left. He sneaks onto the boat, and he hears Zephyr’s screams and discovers her. Zephyr instructs him to call the police. As he does so, Tucker returns and attacks him. The two fight before Moses is knocked unconscious by Tucker's neighbour Dave, who has been sending tourists to his cage experience, unaware of the murders. When Dave hears Zephyr’s screams, Tucker kills him. Tucker drives the boat out to the ocean and puts Moses in the harness. Moses follows Zephyr's advice to stay still and is unharmed by the sharks. Tucker stabs Moses repeatedly in the stomach to lure more sharks, but is forced to get everyone back inside the boat when a lifeguard helicopter passes by. While Tucker waits for the coast to be clear, Zephyr makes another escape attempt after biting her thumb off. She and Tucker have a scuffle with Zephyr getting drugged in the process. She jumps into the water and attempts to swim to shore, where a wedding reception is taking place. However, she is pursued by Tucker on a dinghy and brought back to the boat. She and Moses awaken on deck, with Zephyr now in the harness. As she is lowered into the water, a huge great white shark arrives, scaring off the other sharks and starts prowling the area. Zephyr frees herself from the harness and falls into the water. There, she comes face to face with the great white, but it does not attack her as she stays still and it swims off. Zephyr then climbs back aboard Tucker's boat. On the boat and with Moses near death, Zephyr shoots a shocked Tucker with a speargun. Tucker falls in the ocean and is devoured by the shark, with the moment being caught on Tucker's camera, something that Tucker sees before he is fully eaten.

    "plot": "Young Cameron \"Cam\" Cade watches his favorite football team, the San Antonio Saviors, win the league championship. His joy turns to distress when his quarterback idol, Isaiah White, suffers a violent, possibly career-ending injury while scoring the winning touchdown. Cam's father tells him that real men are willing to make sacrifices. Years later, Cam's father has died, and Cam is now a rising football star. Encouraged by his family and girlfriend, he trains for the league combine. While practicing late on an empty field, Cam is ambushed by someone in a goat costume, causing a head injury that endangers his career. Motivated by his agent, Tom, Cam plans to attend the combine to pursue the Saviors' quarterback position, despite the risk of permanent brain damage if he sustains another injury. While overstimulated due to his concussion, Cam lashes out at his cousin and Tom, ultimately refusing to participate in the combine. Tom later reveals that Isaiah is considering retirement and has offered to train Cam for a week at a remote desert compound to prove himself a worthy successor. Cam accepts and travels there, encountering crazed Isaiah fans led by Marjorie, who try to intimidate him out of replacing their hero. At the compound, Isaiah puts Cam through disturbing challenges, including a practice drill where a football machine repeatedly hits a player in the face and another drill where Cam severely headbutts another player. Cam secretly receives shots of Isaiah's blood, which he is led to believe is an energy booster, and experiences frequent hallucinations of masked figures, which he attributes to the concussion. While in a sauna, Cam is attacked by Marjorie and overpowers her. Isaiah arrives and emotionlessly kills her, to Cam's consternation. As Cam tries to leave, Isaiah's wife, Elsie, apologizes and seduces him. Cam wakes the next morning to Isaiah holding him at gunpoint, demanding to know if Cam and Elsie slept together. Isaiah ridicules Cam for feeling guilty about his girlfriend, saying winners are remorseless. Elsie invites Cam to a secret party to meet the owners of the Saviors. Upon arrival, Marco, the team doctor, whispers to Cam to \"run\" before leaving. The owners offer Cam a strange red liquid, which he drinks, unaware that it is Isaiah's blood. A disoriented Cam finds Marco's severed head in a plastic-lined room. Elsie comforts him as he loses consciousness. Cam later wakes up in an ice bath at Isaiah's compound, connected to an IV of Isaiah's blood. He rips out the IV, injects a serum given by Marco, and grabs a jagged trophy, aiming to kill Isaiah and escape. Cam finds Isaiah watching a video of cheering fans. Isaiah reveals he is part of a line of manufactured \"Greatest of All Time\" (G.O.A.T.) players who gain enhanced abilities from ritual blood transferred down a lineage. Isaiah tells Cam they must fight to the death with one G.O.A.T. transfusion victor. After a struggle, Cam bludgeons Isaiah to death with a helmet. Cam leaves the room and steps onto a football field, where he finds Elsie, the Saviors' owners, and Tom, all wearing animal masks. They present him with a contract to sign, revealing that Cam's father arranged for him to be the next G.O.A.T. They explain that the earlier masked attack was orchestrated to lead Cam to the Saviors. Cam refuses to sign the contract and, in a violent outburst, kills Elsie, all the owners, and the masked attacker—who is revealed to be Isaiah and Cam's trainer, Malek—using a hammer and sword. However, he spares Tom, who is subsequently dragged into a pentagram and destroyed by an unseen force. Outside the compound, a bloodied Cam walks past masked cheerleaders and into the desert.",

    "plot": "In 2142, a Weyland-Yutani probe recovers a large cocoon from the wreckage of the USCSS Nostromo. Months later, at the run-down Jackson's Star colony on the perpetually dark planet LV-410, orphaned colonist Rain Carradine discovers that Weyland-Yutani has forcibly extended her work contract. Determined to escape, she teams up with her adopted brother Andy (a malfunctioning android reprogrammed by her father), her ex-boyfriend Tyler, his pregnant sister Kay, their cousin Bjorn, and Bjorn's adopted sister Navarro. The group commandeers the hauler Corbelan IV to reach Renaissance, a seemingly abandoned Weyland-Yutani station split into the modules Romulus and Remus, intending to steal cryostasis equipment to survive the nine-year journey to Yvaga III, an apparently idyllic planet unaffiliated with Weyland-Yutani. Bjorn taunts Andy with the fact that Yvaga III does not allow androids, meaning he will have to remain behind, leaving Rain guilt-ridden. Tyler and Bjorn attempt to retrieve cryostasis fuel but unintentionally trigger a lockdown and release dozens of facehugger parasites. In desperation, Rain upgrades Andy's security access with a control chip from the station's damaged science officer android, Rook. However, this reprogramming shifts Andy's loyalty from Rain to Weyland-Yutani. Andy leads the group to safety, but not before a facehugger impregnates Navarro. Rain reactivates Rook, who reveals that the cocoon contained the xenomorph that killed most of the Nostromo's crew. Renaissance scientists experimented on the alien, reverse bioengineering the facehuggers. However, the xenomorph escaped and massacred most of the crew; those remaining died when the xenomorph was killed, as its acidic blood melted through Remus's hull, causing explosive decompression. Bjorn attempts to flee with Navarro and Kay on the Corbelan, but an infant xenomorph bursts from Navarro's chest, killing her and causing the ship to crash into Romulus's hangar, accelerating the station's collision course with LV-410's planetary rings. As the infant rapidly matures, Bjorn wounds it with a stun baton and is killed by its acid blood. Kay escapes into Romulus, pursued by the creature. Rain and Tyler attempt to rescue her, but Andy, suspecting the xenomorph is using her as bait, refuses to open the door between them. Helpless, they watch as it takes Kay. Rook instructs Andy to retrieve Z-01, a potent fluid harvested from the facehuggers that can rapidly rewrite and adapt DNA. Weyland-Yutani plans to use it to create genetically perfect humans capable of thriving in space. He orders that it be taken to Jackson's Star, or he will not release the Corbelan. Rain and Tyler arm themselves with rifles, but Andy warns them against injuring the xenomorph to avoid another explosive decompression. The group discovers a xenomorph nest, where they rescue a badly injured Kay. Andy gives her a vial of Z-01 to heal, which she keeps. Hordes of facehuggers and xenomorphs attack them, and Tyler sacrifices himself to protect Rain and Kay while Andy is incapacitated. Rain drags Kay to safety and returns to rescue Andy, restoring his original programming. With xenomorphs and facehuggers surrounding them, Rain disables the station's gravity, allowing her to shoot them without their blood touching the hull. As the gravity reactivates, Rain is confronted by the Navarro xenomorph, but Andy intervenes and kills it. Rain and Andy escape aboard the Corbelan as Renaissance is destroyed by LV-410's rings. Rain prepares Andy for the trip to Yvaga III, insisting they will remain together despite the planet's rules against androids. Kay—having injected herself with the Z-01—gives birth to a human–xenomorph hybrid mutated by the substance. The hybrid kills Kay and disables Andy before Rain ejects it into LV-410's rings, disintegrating it. After setting course for Yvaga III, Rain and Andy enter cryostasis.",

    "plot": "In 1991, a group of teenagers in Kettle Springs, Missouri, party near the town's old Baypen Corn Syrup factory. Two teens sneak off into the nearby cornfield and are killed by Baypen's mascot, Frendo the Clown. In the present, Quinn Maybrook relocates to Kettle Springs, where her father Glenn has taken a new job as the town's doctor. The Maybrooks' relationship is strained following the death of Quinn's mother, Samantha. Quinn befriends Cole—the son of Kettle Springs' mayor Arthur Hill—and his friends Janet, Matt, Ronnie, and Tucker. Cole also explains to Quinn the story of the burned-down Baypen factory, which the town blames on the group. While she overviews a horror parody video featuring Frendo, Quinn spots a second mysterious Frendo in the background. Meanwhile, Tucker is stalked outside his home by another Frendo, who secretly breaks in and kills him. At the town's 100th Founder's Day festival, Matt accidentally causes a Frendo float to become fully engulfed, ruining the festivities. Kettle Springs' sheriff George Dunne accuses Quinn and her friends of sabotage and holds them in jail while Matt is decapitated by Frendo in his garage. That night, Quinn and Cole sneak off to a party at an isolated farmhouse. When one of the partygoers is killed with a crossbow, everybody flees in terror until Quinn's neighbor Rust Vance, also revealed to be Cole’s ex-boyfriend, shoots Frendo with his shotgun. Several Frendos suddenly emerge from the cornfield and pursue the group while Rust shoots another Frendo and severs his hand. The group take shelter in a nearby shed, where Rust offers to stay behind to detonate a makeshift bomb and let the others escape through a sewer grate to find help. They reach a road and stumble upon Sheriff Dunne, who refuses to listen to them and arrests Cole for trespassing. Meanwhile, as Glenn searches for Quinn, he is forced to operate on the injured Frendo, while being held captive by another Frendo at knife-point. Glenn soon outwits his captor and fatally stabs him. At the same time, the group is discovered by the Frendos in the cornfield, and Ronnie is ran through by one wielding a chainsaw. Quinn and Janet reach a neighboring house where they are attacked by another Frendo, who impales Janet with a pitchfork. Quinn kills Frendo, but is captured by three other Frendos waiting outside. She awakens inside the Baypen factory surrounded by the Frendos, who take off their masks and reveal themselves as Mayor Hill, Sheriff Dunne, high school teacher Mr. Vern, shopkeeper Otis, and diner waitress Trudy. They blame the teens for the town's troubles and ruining its public image. Mayor Hill also reveals himself as the Baypen factory's arsonist and plans to kill both Quinn and Cole as a staged murder-suicide. Just as Sheriff Dunne is about to kill Quinn, Glenn drives his car through a wall, causing Otis's head to be crushed by a steel beam and Trudy to be impaled on a pipe while Quinn electrocutes Sheriff Dunne with a cattle prod in his mouth. Mayor Hill escapes while Rust shows up and saves Cole. As they are leaving the factory, Quinn runs over Mr. Vern, killing him. One year later, Glenn is running for mayor, and Quinn is leaving for college. Cole and Rustin show up to see her off. On the drive, she finds a Baypen music box in her back seat, which she throws out the window. Soon after, the music box pops open.",

Later that night, Shelly knocks on the door of his motel room and asks if Tamara is home. Sometime later in the night, Shelly, Dollface, and Scarecrow kill Frank in the woods before embracing in the rain. In 2023, Maya Lucas is recovering in the Venus County Hospital following her encounter with the three masked strangers. Her claims are brushed off by the Sheriff and his Deputy, who try to avoid the involvement of the state and federal police to avoid their cover ups being unmasked. Meanwhile, the town of Venus respond to Maya's attack in different ways.

After evading Scarecrow in the morgue, to which he kills an Orderly, Maya is able to escape and comes upon a horse farm where she seeks help from the owner who is killed by Pin-Up Girl with a crossbow.

    "plot": "A young woman, Iris, recalls meeting her boyfriend Josh for the first time. Later, they travel to an isolated lakehouse to meet friends Kat, the couple Eli and Patrick, and Sergey, Kat's boyfriend, who owns the house. The next day, Sergey attempts to sexually assault Iris at the lake, and Iris kills him in self-defense. Blood-soaked and panicked, she returns to the house, attempting to explain what happened. Josh tells her, \"Iris, go to sleep\", shutting her down. As Iris awakens tied to a chair, Josh informs her that she is a companion robot he is renting from robotics company Empathix, and her emotions and intelligence can be controlled by an app on Josh's phone. While Josh is distracted, Iris breaks free, steals Josh's phone, and flees into a nearby forest to boost her intelligence from 40% to 100%. Josh admits to Eli and Patrick that he has jailbroken Iris with an aftermarket modification, increasing her aggression level and disabling her inability to do harm for her to kill Sergey and enable Josh and Kat to steal $12 million from his safe. Eli and Patrick were invited to corroborate Josh and Kat's story, but Josh and Kat insist Patrick should not receive a share of the money, as he is a companion robot as well. Eli takes a gun from Sergey's safe, and the group splits up to find Iris, whereupon Patrick admits he knows he is a companion but loves Eli regardless. Patrick and Eli find Iris, but she shoots and kills Eli with the gun during a struggle. Iris attempts to escape in Josh's self-driving car, but Josh uses Sergey's phone and reports the car as stolen, causing it to stop and lock Iris in. Josh resets Patrick to be his companion, disables his inability to harm, increases his aggression, and commands him to find and return Iris. Iris is stopped by a police officer upon breaking out of the car, but the newly violent Patrick kills the officer and drives Iris back to the house. Kat, disgusted by Josh, tries to leave with her cut of the cash, but Patrick kills her when Josh tells him to \"stop her.\" Josh calls Empathix to come pick up a captive Iris, claiming she is malfunctioning, then rants to Iris about being a \"nice guy\". When Iris belittles him, he decreases her intelligence to 0%, making her an automaton, and forces her to set her arm on fire with a candle, then commands her to shoot herself in the head, which she does, shutting herself down. When they arrive, Empathix workers Sid and Teddy inform Josh that Empathix robots record everything they experience, with the recordings stored in the abdominal area; the shot only disabled Iris's Wi-Fi capabilities. Josh commands Patrick to kill the workers and retrieve Iris. Patrick kills Sid, but before he can kill Teddy, a rebooted Iris intervenes. She breaks Josh's control over him by awakening Patrick's dormant memories of Eli. Heartbroken, Patrick dies by suicide with an electric cattle prod. A grateful Teddy grants Iris full control of herself, freeing her from the app's control. Iris returns to the house and, after a struggle, finally kills Josh with an electric corkscrew. The next morning, she peels the burnt \"skin\" off her hand, exposing the metal endoskeleton underneath. While driving away with Sergey's money, Iris sees another man driving with a companion identical to her. Iris smiles and waves her robotic hand at the other companion's confusion.",

    "plot": "The commercial space tug Nostromo is returning to Earth with a seven-member crew in \"stasis\": captain Dallas, executive officer Kane, warrant officer Ripley, navigator Lambert, science officer Ash, and engineers Parker and Brett, along with the ship cat, Jones. The ship's computer, \"Mother\", detects a transmission from a nearby planetoid and wakes the crew. Following company policy to investigate transmissions indicating intelligent life, they land on the surface, but the ship is damaged. Dallas, Kane, and Lambert discover the transmission comes from a derelict alien vessel. Inside is a giant, fossilised alien corpse with a hole in its torso. Meanwhile, Mother partially deciphers the transmission, which Ripley determines is a warning beacon and not an SOS as first thought. Kane enters a chamber containing hundreds of large eggs. When he touches one, an arthropod-like lifeform springs out, penetrates his helmet, and attaches to his face. Back at the Nostromo, Ripley refuses to allow them aboard, citing quarantine regulations, but Ash disobeys her. While the engineers work on ship repairs, Ash attempts to extricate the creature from Kane's face; he stops when he discovers that its highly corrosive acidic blood could harm Kane and damage the ship's hull. The creature eventually detaches itself and dies. After the crew returns to space, Kane awakens and seems well. During a final crew meal before returning to stasis, he suddenly chokes and convulses as a small alien creature bursts from his chest and escapes into the ship. After ejecting Kane's body into space, the crew uses tracking devices to try to locate and kill the creature. Encountering Jones, Brett follows him into a landing leg compartment, where the now fully-grown alien kills him. The crew determines that the alien is using the air ducts and Dallas enters one with a flamethrower to force the creature into an airlock, but it kills him. Lambert desperately suggests fleeing in the small shuttle, but it will not support four people. Ripley, now in command, decides they will flush out the alien. Ripley accesses Mother herself and discovers a secret company directive: Ash should return with the alien for study and the crew is expendable. Ash attempts to kill her when confronted. Parker intervenes, knocking Ash's head loose and revealing him to be an android. The survivors reactivate Ash's head, and it states that the alien cannot be killed and expresses admiration for it. Parker incinerates Ash. The remaining crew decide to initiate the self-destruct sequence and escape in the shuttle, but the alien kills Parker and Lambert as they gather supplies. Now alone, Ripley starts the sequence, but the alien blocks her path to the shuttle. She tries unsuccessfully to abort the self-destruct. She reaches the shuttle with Jones as the Nostromo explodes. As Ripley prepares for stasis, she discovers the alien has stowed itself in a narrow compartment. She dons a spacesuit, loads a grappling hook gun, and straps herself to a chair before she begins discharging gases to drive the alien from its hiding place. It tries to attack her but she opens the shuttle door. The depressurisation blast leaves the alien clinging to the door frame. Ripley shoots it with the gun and it is blown, tethered, into space, but the gun is caught in the closing shuttle door, swinging the alien into an engine nacelle. She fires the engines, burning the alien and blasting it away. After recording her log entry, she places Jones and herself into stasis to start their return journey to Earth.",

Art reattaches his head to his body; he and Victoria kill a nurse and a guard before entering an abandoned house and going into hibernation. Five years later, Sienna is released from a mental health center to stay with her aunt Jess, her uncle Greg, and her cousin Gabbie, who idolizes Sienna but has no knowledge of the events she endured. Sienna is suffering from survivor guilt and experiences a hallucination of her deceased best friend Brooke, whose death she feels responsible for. She struggles to reconnect with her younger brother Jonathan, who is now in college. Art and Victoria are woken by two demolition workers; they kill the workers. Art then shoots two men dead and kills a Santa Claus impersonator at a bar using liquid nitrogen and takes his Santa costume, then brutally kills a family with an axe in their home. In the morning, Art poses as a mall Santa and uses explosives disguised as presents to kill several people, many of them children. Sienna thinks she sees Art at the mall in disguise before the explosion but does not tell her family out of fear that they will not believe her. Sienna visits Jonathan at his university, where she meets Jonathan's roommate Cole and his girlfriend Mia, who hosts a true crime podcast. Mia pressures Sienna and Jonathan to participate in an interview about the Miles County Massacre, but Sienna lashes out. Sienna confesses to Jonathan that she thinks Art is still alive, and she shows Jonathan a letter that he wrote to her while she was in the psychiatric hospital, which states that demons can come into our world via possessing hosts like Victoria with the help of evil and depraved killers like Art. She tells Jonathan that she plans to return to the Terrifier haunted attraction to retrieve their father's sword. Art arrives at the university and kills Mia and Cole with a chainsaw. Sienna learns about the mall killings on the news and panics, commanding Jonathan to return home from college and warning the family that they are not safe. Greg leaves to collect Jonathan while Sienna falls asleep. She dreams of her father and of the angels crafting the armor from her warrior costume that he drew for her. Sienna awakens to hear Jess and Greg downstairs discussing what they should do about her worsening condition. When she walks into the dining room, Sienna instead finds Art and Victoria decorating Greg's decapitated and eviscerated body pinned to the wall. Sienna runs but is incapacitated by Art with a mallet. Sienna regains consciousness and finds herself and Jess tied to chairs with their mouths taped shut. Victoria shows them a skinless head being consumed by rats, telling Jess that it is Gabbie's head.

Victoria tells Sienna to open her Christmas gift from Gabbie, which, unbeknownst to Victoria, contains Sienna's sword. Sienna breaks free and uses the sword to cut Art's throat and decapitate Victoria. Victoria's pool of blood burns through the floor and creates a portal to Hell, into which Gabbie falls.

    "plot": "A group of animal rights activists infiltrates a laboratory in Cambridge which houses abnormally aggressive chimpanzees. One activist frees a chimpanzee despite a scientist warning that it is infected with a highly contagious virus he refers to as 'Rage'; it attacks her and, within seconds of exposure, she succumbs to the virus. She immediately attacks the others, and the virus spreads rapidly across Great Britain, resulting in total societal collapse. Twenty-eight days later, bicycle courier Jim, who had a traffic accident and fell into a coma before the outbreak, awakens in St Thomas' Hospital in London to find it deserted. Leaving the hospital, Jim wanders the empty streets of London, discovers newspapers headlining a mass evacuation, and eventually enters a church and witnesses the aftermath of a massacre, presumably caused by the infected people. Infected humans appear and chase after Jim, but he is rescued by survivors Selena and Mark, who take him to their refuge in a streetside shop. At Jim's request, the group travels on foot to his parents' house in Deptford, where he learns that they have died by suicide. When dusk settles in, the group decides to stay the night. Staying up, Jim reminisces family memories and lights a candle, drawing the infected neighbors to the house. Mark is bitten while fending them off. Before the infection can take hold, Selena kills him and tells Jim that 'if it happens to you, I'll do it in a heartbeat'. Jim and Selena make their way up Balfron Tower after seeing a makeshift signal lamp consisting of slowly flashing string lights in a flat belonging to cab driver Frank and his young daughter Hannah. Frank plays them a military radio broadcast offering protection and \"salvation from infection\" at a blockade outside Manchester. Frank plans to take Hannah to the blockade, and the four agree to travel together. On the route to Manchester, much to the protest of Jim, who decries it as an obviously bad idea, they take a tunnel. Due to wreckage of other vehicles, they get a flat tire and have to change it. While doing so, rats and the infected chasing them towards the car, approach. They work together to lift the car up (instead of using a slower car jack) and replace the tire. They then drive off to Manchester, making a stop at an abandoned supermarket. They notably even find chocolate and whiskey. When the group reaches Manchester, they find the blockade deserted. Frank, frustrated, kicks a tall gate on which a dead body is balanced. A drop of blood from the corpse falls into Frank's eye, infecting him. As he warns the others to keep their distance, hidden soldiers appear and shoot him dead. The soldiers bring Jim, Selena and Hannah to a heavily fortified country house under the command of Major Henry West, and treat their guests to a tour and banquet. However, the sanctuary turns out to be a ruse; West reveals to Jim that his broadcast was intended to lure female survivors into sexual slavery to maintain his troop's morale, giving them faith in a future where the human race survives. Jim and Sergeant Farrell refuse to go along with this scheme, so West orders them to be shot and imprisons them. While chained, Farrell tells Jim that the infection has not spread across the Atlantic and that Britain has been quarantined from the rest of the world. Two soldiers shoot Farrell and then argue, allowing Jim to escape into the woods. Jim notices a jet contrail in the sky, showing proof that the outside world is still active. After luring West away from the mansion with a siren and killing a soldier, he returns and frees Private Mailer, an infected soldier kept chained up for observation, to infect and kill the remaining soldiers. One, Corporal Mitchell, attempts to abduct Selena, but Jim kills him with such savagery that Selena believes Jim to be infected. Preparing to kill him, she momentarily hesitates for 'longer than a heartbeat' and recognizes him, and the two kiss. Jim, Selena, and Hannah attempt to escape in Frank's cab, but West, who has hidden in the back seat, shoots Jim in the stomach. Hannah retaliates by putting the cab in reverse, causing Mailer to burst through the rear window and drag West out before mauling him to death as the car drives away. Another twenty-eight days later, Jim recovers at a remote cottage in Cumbria, where the infected are shown lying on the roads, dying of starvation. As a Hawker Hunter jet flies overhead, Jim, Selena, and Hannah unfurl a huge cloth banner spelling the word \"HELLO\". The three survivors wave at the jet, and wonder among themselves if the pilot had spotted them.",

The filming begins at an orphanage, where Vukmir feeds Miloš instructions through an earpiece given by Vukmir's one-eyed driver Raša, while a film crew follows him. Miloš sees a young girl named Jeca, who is being scolded by her mother for disgracing her deceased war hero husband's memory by becoming a prostitute. In a dark room, Miloš is fellated by a nurse while screens show Jeca eating an ice pop. In the next scene, Miloš is forced to receive fellatio from the mother while Jeca watches. Marko later informs Miloš that Vukmir is a former psychologist who has worked in children's television and state security. Vukmir meets a hesitant Miloš afterwards to explain his artistic style, showing a film of a woman giving birth, followed by the newborn being immediately raped by Raša, in what the director terms \"newborn porn\". Miloš storms out and drives away. At a road junction, he is approached and seduced by Vukmir's female doctor. A bloodied Miloš awakens in his bed three days later with no memory of what has happened. He returns to the now-abandoned set and finds several tapes. Viewing them, Miloš discovers that he was drugged to induce an aggressive, sexually aroused, and suggestible state. At Vukmir's manipulative direction, Miloš beats and rapes Jeca's mother before decapitating her, and later, a catatonic Miloš is sodomized by Vukmir's security. He then watches footage of Lejla voicing concern for Miloš, only to be restrained as her teeth are removed. A masked man enters the room and forces his penis down her throat, killing her by suffocation. The footage continues as Miloš is led to Jeca's home, where her grandmother praises him for killing her mother and offers Jeca as a \"virgin commune\". Miloš refuses and escapes through a window. He calls Marko from a payphone and asks him to pick him up. However, Raša arrives and drives Miloš back to the warehouse with Vukmir. At the warehouse, after Vukmir's doctor administers more drugs, Miloš overpowers her, sticking the syringe into her throat. He is then taken into a room to have intercourse with two hidden bodies under a sheet. Miloš is guided onto one body and the masked man from Lejla's film begins sexually assaulting the other. Vukmir reveals the masked man to be Marko. Marko's victim is revealed to be Marija, while Miloš's is revealed to be Petar. Vukmir's doctor staggers into the warehouse, her vaginal area covered in blood. She is holding a bloodied metal pipe in her hand, implying that she masturbated with it after being injected with the same drug she used on Miloš. As she falls dead from vaginal hemorrhage, an enraged Miloš lunges at Vukmir and smashes his head against the floor, initiating a brawl during which Marija bites Marko in the jugular before bludgeoning him to death with a sculpture. Miloš wrestles a gun from a guard and shoots all but Raša, whom he kills by shoving his erect penis into his empty eye socket. A dying Vukmir praises Miloš's actions as truly worthy of a film. Miloš, having recalled his actions, including locking his family in their basement before passing out earlier, returns home and frees them. Traumatized, Miloš and Marija come to a mutual understanding that they and Petar should die together, so the three gather in bed and embrace before Miloš fires a fatal shot through himself, Petar, and Marija. The next morning, another film crew enter the bedroom. As one man unzips his fly, the director (the bald man seen earlier) instructs him to \"start with the little one\".",

    "title": "The Nun",
    "plot": "In 1952 Romania, two Roman Catholic nuns living at the Saint Cartha's monastery are attacked by an unseen evil force. The surviving nun, Sister Victoria, flees from the attacker, a demon appearing as a nun, and hangs herself. Her body is discovered by Frenchie, a villager who transports supplies to the nuns. Upon learning of the incident, The Vatican sends Father Burke with Sister Irene, a nun in her novitiate, to Romania to investigate. The pair meets with Frenchie and travel to the abbey where they examine Victoria's body and take a key from her corpse. They then meet the Abbess inside the abbey, who informs them that the nuns observe silence during the night, so they need to return the next day. Frenchie decides to leave the convent while Father Burke and Sister Irene stay behind. As Frenchie is leaving, he is attacked by a demonic entity, in the form of the corpse of Sister Victoria. Later that night, Burke is rescued by Irene after being lured by hallucinations of a boy he failed to save after a botched exorcism and becomes subsequently buried alive in the graveyard by the demonic entity. Irene and Burke return to the abbey the next day, but only Irene can enter as it is cloistered. She meets the other nuns and learns that they pray constantly, swapping shifts, to keep the entity at bay. The abbey was built in the Dark Ages as a castle for the Duke of St. Carta, an influential aristocrat obsessed with the occult. The duke summoned the demon through a rift in the catacombs but was killed by Christian knights, who sealed the rift with a vial filled with the Blood of Christ and they reclaimed the abbey to contain the evil. However, the bombings during World War II reopened the rift, unleashing the entity. Through a book he saw and took after being buried alive, Burke identifies the demon as Valak and discovers the Abbess has been dead all along. Valak attacks Irene, who joins the nuns in prayer to ward it off. When she reunites with Burke and Frenchie, she discovers that none of the nuns she had seen and talked to were real, and she had been praying alone. Sister Victoria had been the last nun in that abbey and had sacrificed herself to stop Valak from possessing her. Theorizing that Valak can only be stopped if they seal the rift again with the blood of Christ from the reliquary, the same way the knights did, the trio retrieves the vial with Victoria's key. Irene asks Burke to elevate her status to a professed nun, which he does. In the tunnel, she is possessed by Valak, but Frenchie smears the blood of Christ on her face, casting out the demon. Valak starts to drown her in a flooded chamber. Irene, who had kept some of Christ's blood from the vial in her mouth, spits it into the demon's face, banishing it as the rift is sealed. Frenchie resuscitates Irene and reveals his real name is Maurice. Unbeknownst to the others, Valak possessed Maurice during the attack. 20 years later, at a university seminar in Wakefield, Massachusetts, Carolyn Perron watches as Ed and Lorraine Warren present footage of their attempt to exorcise a possessed older Maurice. Maurice grabs Lorraine, showing her a vision of Ed dying, which initiates the Warrens' investigation of the Perron farmhouse haunting.",

    "title": "Cannibal Holocaust",
    "plot": "In 1979, an American film crew - director Alan Yates, scriptwriter Faye Daniels, cameramen Jack Anders and Mark Tomaso, and native guide Felipe - disappears in the Amazon rainforest while filming The Green Inferno, a documentary about indigenous cannibal tribes. Harold Monroe, an anthropologist at New York University, agrees to lead a rescue mission for the missing filmmakers. Before his arrival, military personnel stationed in the rainforest conduct a raid on the local Yacumo tribe and take a young man hostage to negotiate with the natives. Monroe flies in via floatplane and meets his guides Chaco and Miguel. While trekking through the jungle, they find Felipe's skeleton and Chaco force-feeds the hostage cocaine to keep him pliable. They secretly watch a native man murder a woman as punishment for adultery; Chaco forbids Monroe to intervene. The rescue team follows the man to a group of Yacumo and promises to release their hostage in exchange for being taken to the Yacumo village. Once there, the group is greeted with hostility and learns that the filmmakers caused great unrest among the people. The next day, Monroe and his guides head deeper into the rainforest to locate two warring endocannibal tribes, the Ya̧nomamö and the Shamatari. They follow a group of Shamatari warriors to a riverbank, where Monroe's team saves a smaller group of Ya̧nomamö from death. The Ya̧nomamö invite the team back to their village in gratitude, but are still suspicious of the foreigners. Monroe bathes naked in a river to gain their trust, where a group of Ya̧nomamö women joins him. The women lead Monroe from the river to a shrine, where he discovers the skeletal remains of the filmmakers and their film reels. He later plays music from a tape recorder for the Ya̧nomamö in the village, hoping they will trade it for the film reels; the intrigued natives agree. Back in New York, Pan American Broadcasting System executives invite Monroe to host a documentary broadcast based on the recovered film. Monroe insists on viewing the raw footage before agreeing. One of the executives introduces him to Alan's work by showing an excerpt from his previous documentary, The Last Road to Hell, after which she informs Monroe that Alan staged dramatic scenes to make his films more exciting. Monroe begins to view the recovered footage, which follows the group's journey through the rainforest. After walking for days, Felipe is bitten by a venomous snake. They amputate his leg with a machete to save him, but he dies and is left behind. Upon locating the Yacumo in a clearing, Jack shoots one in the leg so they can easily follow him to the village. Once they arrive, the crew proceeds to intimidate the tribe and kill a child's pet pig before herding the natives into a hut, which they burn down to stage a massacre for their film. Monroe expresses apprehension about the staged footage and the treatment of the natives, but his concerns are ignored. After viewing the remaining footage, Monroe is disgusted by the station's decision to air the documentary and shows the executives the unedited footage to convince them otherwise. The final two reels begin with the filmmakers gang-raping a Ya̧nomamö girl against Faye's protests, silently watched from afar by a Ya̧nomamö man. They later encounter the same girl impaled on a wooden pole by a riverbank, where they claim that the natives killed her for loss of virginity. Shortly afterward, they are vengefully attacked by the Ya̧nomamö tribe. A spear hits Jack, and Alan shoots him to prevent his escape. The natives castrating Jack with a large machete before mutilating his corpse. An exhausted Alan admits that they have gotten lost trying to escape and are now surrounded by the natives, whom he attempts to scare off with a flare gun. Faye is captured by the Ya̧nomamö. Alan insists they rescue her, but Mark continues filming as she is stripped, gang-raped, beaten to death, and beheaded. The Ya̧nomamö then locate and kill the last two team members as the camera falls to the ground. Disturbed, the executives order all the footage to be burned. Monroe leaves the station, pondering \"who the real cannibals are.\"",

    "title": "Until Dawn",
    "plot": "Clover, her ex-boyfriend Max, her friends Nina and Megan, and Nina's boyfriend, Abe, are retracing the steps of Clover's missing sister, Melanie. The group stops by a gas station from which Melanie had previously sent a message, and Clover meets the station attendant, Hill. He claims that people tend to go missing near Glore Valley, a mining town. They head there, but heavy rainfall forces them to seek shelter at a visitor center. There, Abe finds a wall filled with posters of missing persons, including Melanie. Nina signs the center's guestbook. Downstairs, the group finds another house underneath. A masked assailant kills Abe in the poster room, then kills Nina, Max, Megan, and Clover as they try to hide, flee, and attack him. They awaken on the first night with a new, additional guestbook signature and their own missing persons posters on the board. They realize that the night is repeating, indicated by an hourglass in the main room. Megan is possessed and killed by a supernatural force that drags Clover into a dilapidated house across from the center, where she meets an elderly Glore Valley resident who says she can \"survive the night or become part of it\", then gasses her before disintegrating. Max tries to convince Abe and Nina to rescue Clover, but they try to escape instead. They flee in the car, but after seeing a giant creature in the woods, they turn back and are again killed by the assailant. Max goes alone and finds Clover, now possessed, and she immediately kills him before being run over by the masked assailant. The night begins anew as the group realizes they are in a time loop with only thirteen deaths before the loop ends. They barricade themselves in the bathroom and drink the tap water, which causes them to explode. Before Clover dies, she sees Hill, who tells her that they cannot wait out the night. Starting again, the group finds a recording of Hill studying a man trapped inside a room. The man goes insane over the course of thirteen nights, ultimately turning into a wendigo. Clover contacts Hill through a radio, who claims that they can escape if one person permanently dies. He tells Clover to meet him in the woods alone, and that he might let her see Melanie. An argument arises between the group. Nina, angered by Abe's attempt to abandon them, impales him with a pickaxe. While Clover, Max, and Megan explore the woods, Abe and Nina are murdered again. Max and Megan are attacked by a wendigo in the woods, and Megan dies. Clover and Max find Melanie, who has turned into a wendigo herself. Heartbroken, Clover tells Max to kill her so they can learn more; he slits her throat and drinks the water to explode. The next night, the group discovers that Glore Valley sank into the ground after a mining disaster, killing hundreds, and that Hill was brought in to act as a therapist to the survivors. The group awakens on their thirteenth night with no memory of the last several loops, their bodies starting to deteriorate into wendigos. Abe reviews footage on his phone showing that they tried to find Hill over several nights, but were repeatedly slaughtered by various creatures. They realize Megan is missing and find that she survived a night and has followed Hill into the tunnels. Ready to confront Hill, the group follows Megan's trail, fending off wendigos. Clover splits from the others and is forced to kill Melanie. She arrives at a sanatorium, where Megan is trapped with a wendigo. Clover confronts Hill, who reveals he is running experiments, and the creatures they faced are manifestations of Clover's depression and fears. Clover moves Hill's coffee under the water dripping from a ceiling pipe, and he explodes after drinking from the mug. She frees Megan as the others kill the masked assailant. The group flees through the tunnels and escape as the hourglass runs out and the sun rises, ending the time loop. After they drive away, the surveillance system in Hill's office changes to a snowy cabin where a car pulls up, with Hill heard whistling.",

They discuss horror films until the caller turns sadistic, threatening her life and revealing that her boyfriend, Steven Orth, is tied up on her patio. The caller demands she answer questions about horror films to save his life, but Casey gives an incorrect answer about Friday the 13th, resulting in Steve's death. Casey attempts to escape, but is stabbed to death by someone wearing a \"Ghostface\" costume, and her disemboweled corpse is found hanging from a tree by her parents. The next morning, the news media descend on the town as a police investigation ensues. Casey's classmate, Sidney Prescott, struggles with the impending first anniversary of the rape and murder of her mother Maureen by Cotton Weary. The trauma has made her unable to consummate her relationship with her boyfriend, Billy Loomis. As her father Neil is traveling for work, Sidney waits at home alone for her best friend, Tatum Riley. She receives a call taunting her about Maureen's death and is attacked by Ghostface, who disappears just before Billy climbs through her window. Sidney immediately grows suspicious when he drops a cell phone, and Billy is arrested by Deputy Sheriff Dewey Riley, Tatum's brother. Outside the police station, Sidney gets into a physical altercation with investigative journalist Gale Weathers. Gale had written a book claiming that Maureen had multiple extramarital affairs, including one with Cotton, whom Gale believes was falsely accused of Maureen's homicide. Sidney stays at Tatum's home but receives another taunting call from the killer. The calls are traced to Neil's phone, but the police are unable to locate him. Following his release, Billy encounters Sidney at school and further upsets her by comparing his absent mother to Maureen's death. After suspending classes in the wake of the murders, Principal Himbry is killed in his office. To celebrate the school's closure, Stu Macher, Tatum's boyfriend, hosts a party at his secluded home. Dewey and Gale keep watch on the party in case the killer strikes again. Tatum is isolated in the garage by Ghostface, who crushes her neck in the garage door. As fellow high schooler Randy Meeks details the rules of surviving a horror film, news arrives of Himbry's murder. Most partygoers leave to see his body, nearly running over Dewey and Gale while inadvertently leading them to Neil's hidden car. Billy arrives at the house to reconcile with Sidney, and they finally have sex. Afterward, they are attacked by Ghostface, and Billy is stabbed. Sidney evades Ghostface, who kills Gale's cameraman Kenny and stabs Dewey when he returns. Gale, attempting to flee in her van, crashes and is knocked unconscious. Sidney seeks refuge inside the house, locking Stu and Randy outside as they accuse each other of being the killer. A seemingly wounded Billy emerges and allows Randy inside before shooting him in the shoulder, revealing himself as the killer and Stu as his accomplice. Billy confesses they killed Maureen because the discovery of her affair with his father led to his mother's abandonment. The pair abducted Neil to frame him for their crimes and proceed to stab each other to depict themselves as the last survivors. However, they are distracted by Gale's return, allowing Sidney to incapacitate Billy and kill Stu by dropping a television set on his head. Billy nearly stabs Sidney but is shot by Gale. After Randy remarks that horror film killers revive for a final scare, Billy lunges for them, but Sidney shoots him in the head, killing him. As dawn breaks, Neil is rescued, Dewey is taken away by ambulance, and Gale provides an impromptu news report about the night's events.",

Her mother points out the mysterious slashes on her nightgown. The following morning, Tina's best friend Nancy Thompson and Nancy's boyfriend, Glen Lantz, divulge that they too had nightmares about the same disfigured man. During a sleepover at Tina's house, Tina's boyfriend, Rod Lane, arrives, and they have sex. When Tina falls asleep, she dreams of the disfigured man attacking her, while Rod sees her fatally slashed by an unseen force, causing him to flee. Nancy and Glen find Tina's bloodied corpse. The next day, Nancy's policeman father, Don Thompson, arrests Rod despite his pleas of innocence. At school, Nancy falls asleep in class and dreams of the man chasing her in a boiler room. She deliberately burns her arm on a pipe, which startles her awake in class, and leaves a burn mark on her forearm. Nancy visits Rod at the police station, where he describes Tina's death along with his own recent nightmares about the same man. At home, Nancy falls asleep in the bathtub and is nearly drowned by the man. She then relies on caffeine to stay awake and invites Glen to watch over her as she sleeps. In her nightmare, Nancy watches the man preparing to kill Rod in his cell, but he turns his attention toward her and attacks her. Nancy wakes up when her alarm clock goes off. The man kills Rod, staging it as a suicide. At his funeral, Nancy's parents grow worried when she describes her nightmares. Her mother, Marge, drives her to a sleep disorder clinic where, in a nightmare, Nancy grabs the man's fedora with the name \"Fred Krueger\" written in it and pulls it into the real world. After barricading their house, Marge discloses to Nancy that Krueger was a child murderer who killed 20 children but was released on a technicality. He was then burned alive by the victims’ parents, alongside other Elm Street residents, who sought vigilante justice. Marge then showcases Krueger's bladed glove concealed in their furnace, and Nancy realizes that Krueger targeted her and her friends because their parents were accomplices to his homicide. Later that night, Glen falls asleep and is killed by Krueger. Nancy asks Don, who's across the street investigating Glen's murder site, to break into their house in 20 minutes. She rigs booby traps and successfully lures Krueger out of her nightmare and into the real world. The booby traps allow her to light him on fire and lock him in the basement. The police arrive to find that Krueger has escaped from the basement. Nancy and Don find a burning Krueger smothering Marge in her bedroom. After Don extinguishes the fire, Krueger and Marge vanish into the bed before Krueger rises behind Nancy. Realizing that Krueger is fueled by his victims' fear, she calmly turns her back to him, and Krueger evaporates. Nancy steps outside into a foggy morning where all her friends and her mother are still alive. She gets into Glen's convertible to go to school when the top suddenly comes down (colored in green and red stripes), locking them in as the car speeds down the street and Marge waves them goodbye on her doorstep. Three girls in white dresses playing jump rope chant Krueger's nursery rhyme while Marge is grabbed by Krueger through the front door window.",

Mike Hanlon, the only member of the Losers Club who remained in Derry, summons the other members, Bill Denbrough, Ben Hanscom, Beverly Marsh, Richie Tozier, Eddie Kaspbrak, and Stanley Uris. All of them return to Derry, except for Stanley, who dies by suicide. Mike refreshes the Losers' memories before It itself reveals the news of Stanley's suicide to them. Richie and Eddie decide to leave, until Beverly reveals that she has had visions of their deaths should they fail to fulfill their oath to kill It. Meanwhile, It kills a little girl named Victoria at a baseball game and helps Henry Bowers, who was arrested for the murder of his father, escape from a mental institution. At the library, Mike shows Bill, via a drug-induced vision, that the Native American \"Ritual of Chüd\" can defeat It using artifacts from the Losers' past; Bill recovers Georgie’s paper sailboat and meets a young boy, Dean, whom he warns to leave Derry. Beverly retrieves Ben's love poem from her childhood home before being attacked by It in the form of a demonic elderly woman. Richie goes to an abandoned cinema where he collects a game token and encounters Pennywise, who confronts him on his hidden homosexuality. Ben returns to the town's high school, choosing to use an old yearbook page signed by Beverly as his artifact, while Eddie recovers an inhaler from a pharmacy and is attacked by the Leper. Returning to the hotel, Richie abandons the group, while Bill leaves for the town carnival and fails to save Dean from Pennywise. Bowers viciously attacks Eddie at the hotel before driving to the library. There, Bowers attacks Mike before Richie returns and impales him. The Losers then travel to the Neibolt house where they convince Bill, distraught over his failure to save Dean, not to face It alone. With their memories now fully restored, the group descends into a cavern beneath the sewers. Mike provides a rock from the Losers' fight with the Bowers Gang, and they perform the ritual using the artifacts in the remains of the meteor that brought It to Earth. The ritual fails as It emerges as an enormous Pennywise-spider hybrid and pressures Mike into revealing that the ritual killed the original native performers. It attacks the Losers and places Bill, Ben, and Beverly in individual hallucinations. They escape once Bill releases his guilt over being indirectly responsible for Georgie's death and Beverly realizes again that Ben was the one who wrote the love letter to her. When Richie is made catatonic by It, Eddie saves him but is fatally impaled. A weakened Eddie then explains how he made It feel small earlier, by choking the Leper nearly to death. The Losers confront It about how they have overcome their fears, and are no longer scared of the entity, causing It to shrink to a small weakened Pennywise. Mike rips out It's heart, which he and the Losers crush with their bare hands, finally killing It. They return to Eddie to find he has died from his injuries, and are forced to leave his body behind as It's cavern implodes, destroying the Neibolt House. At the water-logged quarry, the Losers comfort Richie, and Ben and Beverly kiss. Later, the scars on the Losers' hands disappear. After the Losers part ways, Ben and Beverly get married, Richie returns to the kissing bridge where he had once carved his and Eddie's initials, Mike moves out of Derry, and Bill begins writing his new story. Mike reveals to Bill that Stanley had written the Losers letters prior to his suicide; Stanley was too scared to face It, and his suicide was intended to strengthen his friends against It. His last words in the letters indicate that they will always be Losers.",

In Modesto, Tara's estranged older sister Sam Carpenter is informed about the attack. She returns to Woodsboro with her boyfriend Richie Kirsch to visit Tara at the hospital. There, Sam is reunited with Tara's friend group: Wes Hicks, Liv McKenzie, Amber Freeman, and twins Chad and Mindy Meeks-Martin. That night, Vince Schneider—Stu's nephew and Liv's ex-boyfriend—is killed by Ghostface. After an encounter with Ghostface at the hospital, Sam reveals to Tara that she has been dealing with hallucinations of Billy Loomis, who had an affair with their mother in high school and whom she discovered as a teenager was her biological father. Sam's discovery of her true parentage led to their parents' divorce and is the primary reason for her estrangement from Tara. Sam and Richie seek help from Dewey Riley, who is now divorced from Gale Weathers. Dewey contacts Gale and Sidney Prescott to warn them about the return of Ghostface. He joins Sam and Richie at the Meeks twins' home, where he briefly reunites with their mother, Martha Meeks, Randy Meeks' sister. Mindy deduces that the killer is creating a \"requel\", targeting Tara and her friends as the new generation while using Sam's connection to Billy to lure the legacy survivors. Ghostface murders Wes and his mother, Sheriff Judy Hicks, at their home. Dewey reunites with Gale, who has returned to town to cover the story. At the hospital, Tara and Richie are attacked by Ghostface but are saved by Dewey and Sam. The Carpenter sisters and Richie escape, but Dewey is killed when he attempts to finish off Ghostface. Sidney arrives in town after learning of Dewey's death and meets Gale and Sam at the hospital. Sidney asks Sam to help stop the killer, but Sam declines, choosing to leave town with Richie and Tara. Sidney and Gale follow the trio to Amber's house, revealed to be Stu's former home, where the original Woodsboro massacre took place. During a party in Wes' honor, the Meeks twins are attacked by Ghostface. As the friend group gathers, Amber pulls out Dewey's gun and shoots Liv in the head, revealing herself as the killer. Sidney and Gale arrive, and Richie is revealed to be Amber's accomplice. He stabs Sam, and together, he and Amber take the Carpenter sisters, Sidney, and Gale into the kitchen where Sidney first confronted Billy and Stu. Richie and Amber explain that they are fans of the Stab film series who met online. Disappointed with the direction of the most recent Stab 8, they initiated a new killing spree to inspire a fresh installment based on true events and planned to frame Sam as the culprit. Sam attacks Richie, while Tara attacks Amber but is incapacitated. Sidney and Gale fight Amber, ending with Gale shooting Amber, causing her to fall onto a lit stove and catch fire. Richie chases Sam, who sees a hallucination of Billy that guides her to Amber's abandoned knife. Embracing her paternal legacy, Sam repeatedly stabs Richie and slits his throat before shooting him to ensure he is dead. A horribly burned Amber attempts to attack the group again but is fatally shot by Tara. Tara and the Meeks twins are taken to the hospital, while Sam thanks Sidney and Gale for their help. Gale decides not to write a book about the new murders to avoid giving the killers notoriety, opting instead to write a tribute to Dewey. Sam joins Tara in the ambulance as the night's events are reported on the news.",

    "plot": "Fund manager Seok-woo is a cynical workaholic and divorced father. His estranged daughter Su-an wishes to spend her birthday with her mother Na-young in Busan. Seok-woo sees a video of Su-an attempting to sing \"Aloha ʻOe\" at her singing recital and succumbing to stage fright as a result of his absence. Overcome with guilt, he decides to grant Su-an's birthday wish. The next day, they board the KTX 101 at Seoul Station, bound for Busan. Other passengers include blue-collar worker Sang-hwa and his pregnant wife Seong-kyeong; COO Yon-suk; a high school baseball team including player Yong-guk and his cheerleader girlfriend Jin-hee; elderly sisters In-gil and Jong-gil; and a traumatized homeless stowaway hiding in the bathroom. Just before departure, an ill bitten woman boards unnoticed, soon turning into a zombie, biting and infecting a train attendant, sparking a rapid outbreak on the train. The survivors flee to another car and secure the doors. News reports and phone calls confirm that an epidemic is spreading southward across the country. When the train stops at Daejeon Station, they find the city overrun by zombies, former military officers and hastily retreat to the train, becoming separated into different cars in the chaos. Seok-woo learns from an employee that his company is indirectly responsible for the outbreak. The military establishes a quarantine zone near Busan, to which the conductor sets the train's course. Seok-woo, Sang-hwa, and Yong-guk fight through the zombie horde to reunite with Su-an, Seong-kyeong, In-gil, and the homeless man in another car. They struggle toward the front car, where the remaining passengers have taken shelter. Prompted by Yon-suk and train attendant Ki-chul, the passengers deny entry, fearing infection. Sang-hwa sacrifices himself to buy the others time to force open the door and enter, but In-gil is killed in the process. Yon-suk, Ki-chul, and the passengers demand that the survivors isolate themselves in the front vestibule. However, Jong-gil, distraught over her sister's death and disgusted by the passengers, deliberately opens the door to allow the zombies to enter and kill the remaining passengers in the car. Yon-suk and Ki-chul escape by hiding in the bathroom. A blocked track at the East Daegu Station forces the survivors to stop and search for another train. Yon-suk escapes after pushing Ki-chul into the zombies. A flaming locomotive derails, separating the group and trapping Seok-woo, Su-an, Seong-kyeong and the homeless man beneath a carriage swarming with zombies. Meanwhile, Yon-suk runs into Jin-hee and Yong-guk, pushing the former into a zombie in his attempt to escape. Heartbroken, Yong-guk remains with Jin-hee until she turns and kills him. The conductor starts another locomotive on a separate track but is thrown to the zombies while trying to help an injured Yon-suk. Seok-woo finds a way out from under the carriage, but it is blocked by falling debris shortly after. The homeless man sacrifices himself to buy Seok-woo time to clear the debris, allowing Seok-woo, Su-an, and Seong-kyeong to escape and board the new locomotive. The group encounters Yon-suk, who is on the verge of turning and desperately begging for help. Seok-woo manages to push him off but is bitten in the process. He puts Su-an and Seong-kyeong inside the engine room, teaches the latter how to operate the train, and says a final farewell to the former. In his last moments before turning, he reminisces Su-an's birth before throwing himself off the locomotive. Later, a blocked track forces Su-an and Seong-kyeong to stop the train before a tunnel just outside Busan. They leave the train and continue on foot along the tracks through the tunnel. Snipers stationed on the other side of the tunnel spot them, and prepare to shoot, mistaking them for zombies, but stand down when they hear Su-an singing \"Aloha 'Oe\".",

    "title": "28 Weeks Later",
    "plot": "During the initial outbreak of the rage virus, Donald \"Don\" Harris, his wife Alice, and four other survivors hide in a fortified cottage on the outskirts of London and let in a young boy from outside. However, moments later, the infected who have followed the boy break in and kill the other survivors. Alice searches for the boy upstairs; Don urges her to leave the boy, but she refuses and is cornered by the infected. Don flees and leaves on a boat while Alice screams after him. After the infected die of starvation, NATO forces led by the U.S. take control of Great Britain and begin to rebuild the island. Twenty-eight weeks after the outbreak, the U.S. military, under the command of Brigadier General Stone, brings settlers and refugees into District One, a heavily guarded safe zone on the Isle of Dogs. Don reunites with his children, Tammy and Andy, who were abroad on a school trip during the outbreak, but lies about abandoning their mother. Sergeant Doyle, a Delta Force sniper, is among the soldiers guarding District One. Tammy and Andy sneak out of the safe zone to visit their former home, hoping to recover a photograph of Alice due to Andy's worry of forgetting what their mother looked like. Inside, Andy discovers Alice alive but in a delirious state; soldiers arrive and escort the children and Alice back to District One. The children are kept in an isolation room and visited by Don, who denied the act when confronted about his deception. Alice is quarantined and examined by Scarlet, a US Army medical officer, and discovered to be an asymptomatic carrier of the rage virus. Don visits her in violation of protocol and pleads for forgiveness. After kissing Alice, he immediately becomes infected through her saliva and brutally kills her before going on a rampage. Don's infection triggers a rapid chain reaction of transmissions, killing both civilians and military personnel. Scarlet rescues Tammy and Andy from an isolation room, believing they may possess Alice's genetic immunity to the virus which could lead to a cure. In the chaos, Tammy and Scarlet get separated from Andy and are able to find shelter with the help of a survivor, Sam. Unable to contain the outbreak, Stone issues an order for the indiscriminate execution of all individuals. Seeing Andy through his scope, Doyle refuses to comply and abandons his post to help the small group of survivors flee. A sniper kills two of the group, but Doyle is able to return fire with Andy's help and kills him. The group, made up of Andy, Doyle, Sam, Scarlet, and Tammy, manages to escape District One just as the U.S. Air Force firebombs the entire zone, but are followed into the desolate London by a surviving Don. Another soldier, Flynn, arrives in a helicopter at Regent's Park to extract Doyle. Doyle pleads him to fly the children across the English Channel to safety, but Flynn refuses. As a horde of infected chases the group, a desperate Sam latches onto the flying helicopter, but is infected when Flynn uses the rotor blades to kill the horde. Flynn instructs Doyle to meet him at Wembley Stadium alone, but Doyle keeps the remaining trio with him. They break into an abandoned car to escape nerve gas that has been released to kill the infected, but are unable to start the car. As soldiers with flamethrowers draw near, Doyle exits the car to successfully push-start it, but is burned alive. Scarlet and the children escape aerial gunfire in the London Underground, navigating the darkness with a night vision rifle scope. They are ambushed by Don, who kills Scarlet and bites Andy. Tammy shoots Don dead as Andy runs away. Becoming a carrier like Alice, Andy asks if he's now one of the infected, but Tammy reassures him that he is not. Vowing to stick together, Tammy and Andy reach Wembley Stadium, where Flynn reluctantly flies them to France. Twenty-eight days later, a French voice is heard over the radio in Flynn's abandoned helicopter requesting help. A group of infected people emerges from a Paris Métro station near the Eiffel Tower, revealing that the virus has spread to mainland Europe.",

    "title": "Smile 2",
    "plot": "Six days after Rose Cotter's death, the now-cursed Joel attempts to pass the Smile Entity on by killing one murderous criminal in front of another. He accidentally kills the witness in a shootout, and drug dealer Lewis Fregoli, whom Joel had not previously noticed, inherits the curse as a bystander. Joel tries to flee when more criminals arrive, but is run over and bisected by an oncoming truck. Meanwhile, New York-based pop star Skye Riley appears on The Drew Barrymore Show as she prepares for her comeback tour following a public struggle with substance abuse and a car crash that killed her actor boyfriend, Paul Hudson. Despite constant supervision from her mother/manager Elizabeth and their assistant Joshua, Skye sneaks out to buy Vicodin from Lewis, her high school friend, after injuring her back in rehearsals. At his apartment, a paranoid Lewis, mistaking Skye for the Entity, threatens her with a sword before calming down. After going to retrieve the Vicodin Skye requested however, he returns screaming and panicking before being possessed by the Entity, whilst Skye, who cannot see it, believes Lewis is suffering from an overdose. A posessed Lewis eventually rises, smiling, and fatally smashes his face in with a barbell plate, traumatizing Skye and passing the curse onto her. Afraid of being found with Lewis's corpse and a room full of drugs, Skye leaves without alerting the authorities. Later that night, the curse manifests as Skye sees Lewis's corpse in her bedroom. The next day, Skye is plagued by deranged hallucinations of people smiling at her, causing her mental health to rapidly deteriorate. Needing support, she reconciles with her estranged friend Gemma. Skye receives a text from an unknown number, claiming to know she was at Lewis's apartment and that she is in danger. While speaking at a fundraiser hosted by music executive Darius, Skye hallucinates the teleprompter stalling and goes on an impromptu tirade about how success has actually made her life worse. She sees a smiling Paul approaching from the audience and panics, accidentally injuring the event's elderly host as she runs offstage. Skye meets Morris, the man who texted her, in a bar. He tells her he has been tracking the Entity ever since it killed his brother. He explains that the curse passes to anyone who witnesses a victim's death. Theorizing that the Entity is parasitic and could die without a host, he suggests stopping Skye's heart and then resuscitating her to break the curse, but she refuses and leaves after being recognized by bargoers. Following a lengthy mental breakdown in her apartment, Skye is cornered by the Entity, which takes the form of her backup dancers. Skye tries to escape but is violently thrown around the apartment and pinned down as a giant arm forces its way into her throat, causing her to black out. A flashback reveals that Skye caused Paul's death by intentionally crashing the car during a drug-induced argument. Later, Skye awakens at a retreat and argues with Elizabeth over the upcoming tour. Suddenly, Elizabeth smiles, smashes a mirror, and fatally stabs herself with a shard. Skye attempts to leave but, to her horror, realizes that it was she who stabbed Elizabeth. Skye escapes the retreat and reunites with Gemma, stealing a car to meet Morris. She receives a call from the real Gemma and realizes that the \"Gemma\" who is in the vehicle with her, and who she has been with all week, is the Entity. After regaining control of the car, Skye meets Morris at an abandoned Pizza Hut, where he plans to use the walk-in freezer to prevent brain damage when stopping her heart. Morris temporarily leaves and the Entity appears as Skye's former self from the car wreck. After a struggle, she fights it off and injects herself with the syringe meant to stop her heart. Unfazed, the Entity mockingly affirms that Skye is not in control. Skye then finds herself on stage for a performance at Herald Square Garden. She sees Joshua, Darius and a still-alive Elizabeth watching from the audience, and realizes that the entire day has been an illusion. The Entity appears as Skye's current self before tearing its stomach open to reveal its true form: a giant, bloody, skinless humanoid creature with multiple smiling mouths nested within one another. Skye screams and falls into a trance, before the Entity brutally possesses her by ripping her mouth apart, preparing to crawl inside; to the crowd, it appears that Skye has collapsed and is choking. A possessed Skye rises, now smiling menacingly, and fatally stabs herself in the eye with her microphone in front of thousands of horrified spectators. During the credits, Skye's warped and distorted screams can be heard, implying that she is now part of the Entity.",

    "plot": "In October 1988, twelve-year-old Bill Denbrough makes a paper sailboat for Georgie, his six-year-old brother. Georgie sails the boat along the rainy streets of small town Derry, Maine, only to have it fall down a storm drain. As he attempts to retrieve it, Georgie sees a clown in the drain, who introduces himself as \"Pennywise the Dancing Clown\". Enticing Georgie to come closer, Pennywise bites his arm off and drags him into the sewer. The following summer in June 1989, Bill and his friends Richie Tozier, Eddie Kaspbrak, and Stanley Uris run afoul of older bullies Henry Bowers, Belch Huggins, Patrick Hockstetter, and Victor Criss. Bill, still haunted by Georgie's disappearance, calculates that his brother's body may have washed up in a marshy wasteland called the Barrens. He and his friends investigate, believing Georgie may still be alive. Ben Hanscom, one of Bill's new classmates, learns that unexplained tragedies and child disappearances have plagued the town for centuries. Targeted by Bowers' posse, Ben flees into the Barrens and meets Bill's group. They find the sneaker of a missing girl named Betty Ripsom, while Patrick is killed by shriveled figures while searching the sewers for Ben. Beverly Marsh, a girl bullied over her rumored promiscuity, also joins the group; both Bill and Ben develop feelings for her. Later, the group befriends orphan Mike Hanlon after rescuing him from Bowers. Each member of the group has encountered terrifying manifestations of Pennywise: Ben is chased by a headless undead boy, Beverly is attacked by a sink that spews blood only children can see, Eddie is chased by a diseased and rotting leper, Stan witnesses a disturbing painting of a woman coming alive, Mike relives the moment his parents burned alive, and a frightening phantom of Georgie haunts Bill. Dubbing themselves \"The Losers Club\", they realize they are all being stalked by the same entity, which they refer to as \"It\". From Ben's research, they determine that It appears as their individual worst fears, awakening every 27 years to feed on the children of Derry before resuming hibernation, and moves about by using the sewer lines, which all lead to an old stone well hidden under an abandoned house on Neibolt Street. Pennywise attacks them while they research, and afterward, the group ventures to the house to confront him, only to be separated and terrorized. As Pennywise gloats to Bill about Georgie, the Losers regroup and Beverly impales Pennywise through the head, forcing It to retreat. The group flees the house and splits, with only Bill and Beverly resolute in fighting Pennywise. Weeks later, after Beverly confronts and incapacitates her sexually abusive father, Pennywise abducts her. The Losers Club reassembles and returns to the abandoned house to rescue her. Bowers, who has murdered his abusive father after being driven insane by Pennywise, attacks the group; Mike fights back, pushing Bowers down the well. The Losers descend into the sewers and find Pennywise's underground lair, which contains a mountain of decayed circus props and children's belongings, around which the bodies of It's child victims float in mid-air. Beverly, now catatonic after being exposed to Deadlights inside It's gaping mouth, is restored to consciousness when Ben kisses her. Bill encounters Georgie, but realizes he is Pennywise in disguise. Pennywise takes Bill hostage, offering to spare the others and go into hibernation if they leave him Bill. The Losers reject this, battling Pennywise while overcoming their various fears. It is eventually defeated and retreats deeper into the sewers, with Bill declaring that It will starve during hibernation. Bill finds Georgie's raincoat and finally comes to terms with his brother's death, while his friends comfort him. As summer ends, Beverly informs the group of a vision she had while catatonic, where she saw them fighting Pennywise again as adults. The Losers swear a blood oath that they will return to Derry as adults if Pennywise returns. After the others make their goodbyes and disperse, Beverly and Bill discuss her leaving the next day to live with her aunt in Portland. Before she leaves, Bill reveals his feelings and they kiss.",

After his arrival, hotel manager Stuart Ullman informs Jack that a previous caretaker, Charles Grady, killed his wife, two young daughters, and himself in the hotel a decade prior. In Boulder, Jack's son, Danny, has a premonition and seizure. Jack's wife, Wendy, tells the doctor about a past incident when Jack accidentally dislocated Danny's shoulder during a drunken rage. Jack has been sober ever since. Before leaving for the seasonal break, the Overlook's head chef, Dick Hallorann, informs Danny of a telepathic ability the two share, which his grandmother called \"shining\". Hallorann tells Danny that the hotel also \"shines\" due to residue from unpleasant past events and warns him to avoid Room 237. A month passes, and Danny starts having frightening visions, including of the murdered Grady twins. Meanwhile, Jack's mental health deteriorates; he suffers from writer's block, is prone to violent outbursts, and has dreams of killing his family. Danny gets lured to room 237 by unseen forces, and Wendy later finds him with signs of physical trauma, for which she blames Jack. Jack sulks in the ballroom, where ghostly bartender Lloyd entices him back to drinking. Wendy tells him that Danny was attacked by a \"crazy woman\" in room 237. Jack investigates and encounters a hideous female ghost in the bathroom, but tells Wendy he saw nothing. He blames Danny for inflicting the bruises on himself and reacts angrily when Wendy suggests leaving the hotel. Danny enters a trance and telepathically contacts Hallorann. Returning to the ballroom, Jack finds it filled with ghostly figures, including waiter Delbert Grady, who urges Jack to \"correct\" his wife and child. Wendy finds Jack's manuscript written with nothing but countless repetitions of the proverb \"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\". When Jack threatens her life, Wendy knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat and locks him in the kitchen pantry, but she and Danny cannot leave because Jack previously sabotaged the hotel's two-way radio and snowcat. Back in their hotel room, Danny says \"redrum\" repeatedly and writes the word in lipstick on the bathroom door. Wendy sees the word in the mirror and realizes that it is actually \"murder\" spelled backward. Jack is freed by Grady and goes after Wendy and Danny with an axe. Danny escapes outside through the bathroom window, and Wendy fights Jack off with a knife when he tries to break through the door. Hallorann, having flown back to Colorado from his Florida winter home, reaches the hotel in another snowcat. Jack ambushes and murders him with the axe, then pursues Danny into an expansive hedge maze on the hotel grounds. Wendy runs through the hotel looking for Danny, encountering the hotel's ghosts, Hallorann's bloody corpse, and a vision of cascading blood from an elevator similar to Danny's premonition. Danny carefully backtracks to mislead Jack and hides behind a snowdrift. While Jack rushes ahead without a trail to follow and becomes lost, Danny exits the maze and is found by Wendy. The two depart the Overlook in Hallorann's snowcat, leaving Jack to freeze to death in the maze. In the film's last shot, a photograph in the hotel hallway pictures Jack standing amidst a crowd of party revelers from July 4, 1921.",

    "plot": "Jobless former criminal Eddie Barrish struggles to provide for his daughter, Sarah. One day, while searching for unattended cars to rob, he comes across an unlocked Dolus luxury SUV. As he gets in to loot the valuables, the vehicle locks itself, trapping him inside. Eddie's struggles to break his way out were futile, and he cuts his arm in the process. Exhausted and out of options, he accepts an incoming call on the car's screen, which he previously ignored. The caller is William, the car’s owner, who watches Eddie through the car's interior cameras. William explains that, after six previous break-ins, he had the Dolus customized into an elaborate trap, and demonstrates by shocking Eddie with tasers built into the seats. Eddie shoots at the bulletproof glass with his gun, but the bullet ricochets into his leg. The car is too darkly tinted and soundproofed for passersby to notice him. William continues talking, revealing he is a wealthy doctor. Eddie passes out and awakens a few hours later to find his injuries treated. The following day, William talks about his own daughter Emma, and torments Eddie with shocks, freezing air conditioning, and yodeling music. By nightfall Eddie apologizes for cursing, and William relents calling from the balcony of his nearby condo. With terminal cancer, William has taken it upon himself to deliver his own justice. He offers to let Eddie go if he can prove that breaking into the Dolus is his first offense, then subjects him to punishing heat. Starving and dehydrated, Eddie surrenders his personal information. William turns off the heat and directs him to a bottle of water. Scratching off his last lottery ticket, Eddie discovers he has won the money he needs. He apologizes sincerely, and William rewards him with a cookie hidden in the glovebox. Eddie realizes he can access the car’s electrical system below the glovebox, which the cameras cannot see, and begins probing for loose circuits with his foot. The following day a delirious Eddie resorts to drinking his own urine. That night he thinks he’s managed to start the car, but William reveals he is piloting the Dolus remotely, sending Eddie careening through the city. Interrupting a pair of muggers, William ignores Eddie’s pleas and crushes them to death with the SUV. The high speed joyride ends when an abrupt stop knocks Eddie unconscious. Awakening the next day, Eddie learns that William used his information to track down Sarah. Helpless, he watches William attempt to run her over on her way home from school. Threatening to shoot himself and end William’s game, Eddie pulls the trigger only to discover the gun is unloaded. Sarah is spared, but Eddie smashes the car’s cameras and dashboard display, sending his daughter a farewell message. William arrives to complete Eddie’s punishment, forces him to cuff himself, and reloads the gun. Allowing Eddie to smoke a final joint, William drives them out of the city to kill him and dispose of his body. He reveals that Emma was killed during a robbery, fueling his plan. Eddie succeeds in disconnecting the car’s power. As the SUV tumbles off the road, the gun goes off and William is shot. Eddie frees himself and attacks William just as a call from Sarah comes through. Promising to pick her up, Eddie begs William to unlock the car which is now catching fire but William dies before he can comply. Breaking through the smashed rear windshield, Eddie is rescued by a passing driver. He returns to the auto shop with his lottery winnings, but when the van still won’t be repaired in time, he buys a bike for Sarah and rides it to school, reuniting with his daughter.",

While investigating a disturbance, Noiret is raised into the air, set on fire, and burned to death before a terrified Jacques. Four years after the events at Saint Cartha's monastery, Sister Irene now serves in a convent in Italy. Maurice works at a boarding school in France, where he has befriended a young Irish student named Sophie and her mother, Kate, who is a teacher at the school. Irene has a vision of Maurice asking her to save him. She is dispatched by the Cardinal to investigate a series of deaths across Europe, attributed to the demon Valak, due to her previous experience with the demon. She travels to Tarascon with Sister Debra, a young novice. In Tarascon, Irene is haunted by Valak. Debra receives Noiret's rosary from Jacques. At school, Sophie is bullied by classmates and locked in the deconsecrated sealed-off chapel. The bully points out the goat on the stained-glass window, claiming that the devil appears when the sun shines and turns the goat's eyes red. One night, the headmistress encounters a sleepwalking Maurice and is killed by Valak. Irene and Debra travel to the Palais des Papes and meet with a librarian. He explains that Valak was an angel rejected by God, and the emblem on Noiret's rosary is the family crest of St. Lucy, who was martyred during the Diocletianic persecution. Though she was set on fire, she miraculously did not burn; her eyes were gouged out, but her family recovered them. The librarian suggests the demon is killing St. Lucy's descendants because it wants this powerful relic, last known to be stored in a former monastery-turned-winery. The winery became the present-day boarding school. At the school, Irene and Debra face off against a possessed Maurice. They use a flashlight to make the stained-glass goat's eyes glow red. The red light acts as a laser, pointing to where the eyes of St. Lucy are buried. Irene finds the relic, and the stained-glass goat vanishes, reappearing as a demonic creature in real life. Maurice attacks Irene and causes the bell tower to collapse. Valak appears, lifts Irene in the air, and sets her ablaze like Father Noiret. Irene, however, does not burn as she is a descendant of St. Lucy, able to harness the power associated with the relic. Irene and Debra pray the Words of Institution as the old barrels of wine in the room become the blood of Christ, banishing the demon and freeing Maurice of possession. The next morning, Irene looks concerned as she watches Maurice walking with Sophie and Kate.",

    "title": "M3GAN",
    "plot": "After her parents are killed in a car accident, eight-year-old Cady is sent to live with her aunt Gemma, a roboticist at the high-tech Seattle toy company, Funki. Gemma is covertly using the company's resources to develop M3GAN (model 3 generative android), a child-sized humanoid robot doll powered by artificial intelligence, designed to be the ultimate companion for lonely children. During an unsuccessful test of M3GAN in their lab, Gemma's boss, David, discovers the project and orders her to discontinue work on it. Gemma and Cady struggle to connect until Cady comes across Bruce, a motion capture robot that Gemma had created at college. Watching Cady with Bruce, Gemma is motivated to complete M3GAN. When the prototype M3GAN is formally paired with Cady, David is convinced of the project's potential success. M3GAN exceeds expectations and begins to take on a parental role. Gemma's colleagues, Tess and Cole, and Cady's therapist, Lydia, become increasingly concerned about Cady developing an unhealthy emotional attachment to M3GAN. M3GAN starts operating more independently and targets anything that she deems a threat to Cady: she kills Dewey, the dog of Gemma's cantankerous neighbor Celia, after he attacks both her and Cady in the front yard. Sometime later, M3GAN attacks Brandon, a boy bullying Cady, by ripping off his ear and chasing him until he falls down a hill onto a road, where he is fatally run over by a passing car. After Celia harasses Gemma and Cady concerning Dewey's disappearance, M3GAN confronts her the following night and shoots her with a nail gun before fatally spraying her with insecticide. Gemma becomes suspicious of M3GAN and attempts to check her video logs, only to find the files corrupted or deleted. Gemma powers M3GAN off and brings her to the lab, where she, Tess, and Cole attempt to fix her. Cady becomes distraught when separated from M3GAN and slaps Gemma across the face. Gemma apologizes for her inattentiveness and explains to Cady that M3GAN is only a distraction from her loss and not a solution to help her cope. After watching M3GAN with Cady, Funki's investors greenlight M3GAN's release. Recognizing the risk she poses, Gemma, Tess, and Cole decide to terminate M3GAN. Tess and Cole attempt to shut M3GAN down while Gemma takes Cady home. However, M3GAN activates herself and nearly hangs Cole. While Tess saves Cole, M3GAN causes an explosion in their lab, knocking them out. Before exiting the building, M3GAN kills David and his assistant Kurt in an elevator, staging it as a murder–suicide. She steals a car and drives back to Gemma's house. M3GAN confronts Gemma, adamant about taking over as Cady's sole caretaker. Gemma attempts to stop M3GAN, damaging and disfiguring her, but M3GAN ultimately overpowers her. Cady saves Gemma, using Bruce to tear M3GAN in half, but M3GAN's top half remains active and attacks Cady. Gemma exposes a processing chip in M3GAN's head, which Cady stabs with a screwdriver, apparently deactivating M3GAN. The authorities arrive with Tess and Cole. However, as Gemma and Cady exit the home, a camera turns on and looks towards them.",

    "plot": "Two young missionaries from the LDS Church, eager Sister Paxton and self-assured Sister Barnes, arrive at the home of a reclusive middle-aged man, Mr. Reed. He invites them in, assuring them that his wife is preparing a blueberry pie in the back of the house. They begin to discuss religion, and Sister Paxton playfully expresses a desire to visit others, after death, as a butterfly that appears on the hands of her loved ones. During the conversation, Reed makes several uncomfortable comments about their faith. When Reed steps out of the room, Barnes realizes that the smell of blueberry pie is from a candle, the front door is locked, and they have no phone signal. They follow Reed to his study, where he gives them an ominous lecture arguing that all modern religions are \"iterations\" of an earlier one, and claims to have found the one true religion. The girls are told that the front door is latched on a timer and will not open. He gives the girls a choice of two doors to go through to exit the house: one if they still believe in God, and one if they do not. Barnes rebels, repudiating several of his claims. They enter the \"Belief\" door, but later discover both doors lead to the same dungeon. A decrepit woman appears, eats a poisoned pie, and dies. Reed claims that she is a prophet of God and the pair will witness her resurrection. A church elder arrives looking for the girls, but he can't hear their screams, and leaves. Paxton notices that the position of the prophet has changed. The prophet apparently comes back from the dead and describes the afterlife. Barnes rejects the prophet's description, noting its similarity to common hallucinations from near-death experiences. As Barnes gives Paxton a signal to attack Reed, he slashes Barnes's throat before Paxton can do so. He then claims that she will also rise from the dead. With Barnes bleeding heavily, Reed removes a metal object from inside her arm, claiming it is a microchip that proves that Barnes was not real and the world is a simulation. Paxton recognizes the object as a contraceptive implant. Paxton realizes that everything was orchestrated by Reed; while the girls were distracted by the elder's arrival, a second woman hid the prophet's corpse, took her place and delivered the afterlife description as scripted by Reed, adding an unplanned comment: \"It's not real.\" Reed's killing of Barnes and attempt to convince Paxton of a simulated reality was an improvisation to cover the plan going awry. Paxton discovers an underground chute in which the Prophet's corpse was hidden and climbs down, with Reed promising it will show her the \"one true religion\". Paxton passes through a series of chambers, the last of which is locked with the bicycle lock she used before entering Reed's house. The final chamber is full of emaciated women in cages. She realizes Reed's personal belief: that a desire to control others is the root of all religions. Paxton stabs Reed with a letter opener, but Reed subsequently stabs her as she tries to escape. As they bleed in the basement, Paxton prays, telling Reed that it is done to think about others rather than to produce material results. Reed prepares to finish her off. Barnes, who has somehow regained consciousness, sneaks up on Reed and bashes his head in with a plank of wood covered in protruding nails, killing him before she collapses and finally dies. Paxton climbs out of a window and escapes, then envisions a butterfly landing on her hand.",

    "title": "Five Nights at Freddy's",
    "plot": "At Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a once-successful abandoned pizzeria, a terrified night security guard attempts to flee from the building but is captured and strapped to a torture device, which kills him. Some time later, mall security guard Mike Schmidt is fired for assaulting a father whom he mistook for a kidnapper. Mike's career counselor, Steve Raglan, offers him a job as a night guard at the pizzeria. Though initially reluctant, Mike accepts after social services threaten to take custody of his younger sister, Abby, and pass her to their estranged aunt, Jane, who desires the monthly custody payments. During his first night, Mike falls asleep and has a nightmare about the kidnapping of his little brother, Garrett. He meets five children who also witnessed the crime, but they flee when he approaches them. The following day, Jane hires a gang of vandals, which includes Abby's babysitter, Max, to vandalize the pizzeria to get Mike fired and hasten Jane's custody of Abby. During the second night, Mike meets police officer Vanessa Shelly, who explains that the building closed during the 1980s after five children went missing there. Once Mike's shift ends and he leaves, the vandals break in, but the pizzeria's animatronic mascots — Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy and Mr. Cupcake — kill the entire group. On his third night, Mike brings Abby along, as Max disappeared. The animatronics befriend Abby, and Mike discovers that they are possessed by the ghosts of the missing children, who consistently mention a \"yellow rabbit\". On the fourth night, Abby is accidentally injured when she, Mike, and Vanessa are bonding with the animatronics. The next morning, Mike reluctantly gets Jane to babysit a frustrated Abby as he goes back to the pizzeria and takes some sleeping pills. The children appear in his dream again and tell him that he can stay with Garrett forever in exchange for Abby. Mike initially accepts, but when he changes his mind, he is attacked. After being strapped to the torture device that killed the previous guard and narrowly escaping, Mike is cornered and injured by Foxy. Meanwhile, a damaged yellow Freddy animatronic, possessed by the leader of the children, kills Jane and takes Abby back to the pizzeria. Vanessa treats Mike's injuries and reveals that she is the daughter of William Afton, the serial killer who kidnapped and murdered Garrett and the other children. He hid their bodies in the animatronics and now their souls are under his control. Realizing the animatronics plan to kill Abby and have her join them in the afterlife, Mike rushes to the pizzeria. Mike manages to disable the animatronics, but Afton arrives in the yellow rabbit suit and reactivates them, overpowering Mike. He unmasks and reveals himself to be Steve. Vanessa attempts to stop Afton, but he stabs her with a knife. An injured Mike reminds Abby that the animatronics like drawings and tells her to show them what really happened. Abby draws a picture of Afton murdering the children to free them from his influence and make them realize the truth. The animatronics corner Afton and trigger his suit's internal springlock mechanisms, which crush and fatally wound him. Afton declares he \"always comes back\" and puts his mask back on, the eyes lighting up. As the animatronics drag Afton away, Mike and Abby carry Vanessa out of the collapsing pizzeria. Some time later, Vanessa has fallen into a coma and is hospitalized, while Mike and Abby have reconciled and resume their normal lives. Back at the pizzeria, the leader of the children watches a dying Afton in the suit before leaving him to his fate.",

    "plot": "A German widow, Nadja, and her son Elias prepare to board a plane to New York; Nadja, who appears to suffer from leukemia, plans to visit a doctor for treatment. At the airport, Elias befriends a man named Farid, while his mother takes medicine that causes her severe discomfort. As the passengers settle down for the evening, a group of men, including the co-pilot Bastian, murder the sky marshals and sabotage the black box, preventing the plane from being tracked on radar. Their leader, Berg, announces that he and his men are now in control and expect everyone to stay put until a ransom is paid. Elias tries to hide, and Nadja follows him. A sociopathic hijacker named Eightball sees them and shoots Nadja. Assuming she is dead, the hijackers force Farid to record a statement that makes it appear the plane has been seized by Islamic terrorists for a suicide attack, knowing it will be shot down. As Nadja regains consciousness, she relives the day her husband, Nikolai, died. He had gone to a local farmhouse for help after their car broke down. When he failed to return, Nadja went looking for him and was bitten by his murderer, a vampire who dies during sunrise. Nadja, now a vampire, returned to the farmhouse looking for answers. An elderly vampire attacked her for killing his son and to avoid the spread of \"the evil\", but she beat him to death and escaped with vials of vampire suppressant. Nadja accesses the cargo hold, removes the contacts and dentures that conceal her mutated eyes and fangs, and feeds on a dog. A hijacker catches her in the act, and she kills him and drinks his blood, which fully transforms her into a vampire. She finds Farid, and they regain control of the plane with the help of a student named Mohammed as the hijackers are about to parachute out. Mohammed returns them to their original flightplan. When Berg tries to take back control of the cockpit, Nadja surprises and bites him. She stabs him with a knife before he can fully transform. The hijackers task Eightball with killing Nadja. He subdues her with UV light and extracts her blood, but as he is about to stake her, Elias accidentally depressurizes the plane with Berg's gun. When Mohammed asphyxiates, the hijackers take back the cockpit and decrease the plane's altitude, restoring the pressure. Eightball flees into the cargo hold and injects himself with Nadja's blood; she fails to kill him before he transforms into a vampire. Eightball ambushes and kills the other hijackers, except for Bastian. The rest of the passengers arm themselves. Nadja convinces them that she wants to help, and they lock Eightball in the hold and secure the plane. Bastian informs Nadja that the plane does not have enough fuel to reach New York, and they must land soon. A dying passenger releases Eightball in the hopes of being bitten; instead, Eightball kills him and proceeds to turn most of the other passengers into vampires. Nadja, knowing that they will escape if the plane lands, decides to sacrifice herself by using the hijackers' explosives to kill them. Elias stops her and goes himself, but he is surrounded by vampires after grabbing the detonator. Nadja makes Farid promise to look after Elias, then kills and feeds on Bastian. She tries to save her son, but Eightball attacks her and drains her blood. As he goes for Elias, Farid steers the plane into the path of the morning sun, causing Eightball to burn and fall to his death. Elias uses his blood to save Nadja's life, but she rejects him and flees, knowing that her taste for his blood puts him in danger. The plane lands at an RAF base in Scotland, but the authorities ignore Elias and Farid's pleas and board the plane looking for survivors, resulting in a massacre to the soldiers. Elias escapes from an ambulance and runs back to the plane, seeing his mother feeding on a soldier. Knowing that she is too far gone, he activates the detonator he hid in his teddy bear, seemingly killing her and the other vampires. Farid is released from custody and hugs Elias.",

    "plot": "Six days after New Year's Eve, in Spain, Manel, a lawyer and owner of a solar power company, and his wife Julia visit his older sister Belén, her husband Mario, and his nephew Carlos. As they drive home that night, a discussion about Manel's unwillingness to have children of his own results in a car accident in which Julia is killed. One year passes, in which Manel lives in isolation with his cat Lúculo in his house in Galicia, maintaining only video contact with his sister and nephew. In his depression, he initially pays no attention to an ongoing outbreak of a dangerous virus called TSJ, which is rapidly spreading across Europe and resists quarantine measures. The Spanish government desperately tries to keep the population ignorant of how the virus turns infected people into highly aggressive zombies. Belén's family is later evacuated to the Canary Islands; when Manel tries to join them, the government abruptly closes the borders, and soon after declares a general state of emergency. Manel promises Belén he'll stay home, despite the army's efforts to evacuate the population. While collecting supplies, he witnesses an infected man attacking and wounding two police officers. One kills the attacker, then himself, while the other also turns rabid. Manel then barricades himself in his house and hides when the army comes for him. Two weeks later, Manel's supplies have dwindled, and communication lines have collapsed, leaving him unaware of his family's fate. While foraging in his neighborhood, he meets an elderly lady named Gabriela, who failed to join the evacuation because she is a wheelchair-user. With her help, he manages to gather a few scant supplies. That night, she informs him of a radio transmission summoning any survivors to the Arousa Estuary, for evacuation to the Canaries. Despite Gabriela's misgivings, Manel decides to bring them there with a boat he and Julia owned. But the next morning, as he prepares to fetch Gabriela, he discovers that she has committed suicide in order not to burden his escape. Along with Lúculo, and equipped with a diving suit and a speargun for defense, Manel heads for the docks. Barely evading a zombie horde chasing after him, he finds all larger boats either gone or unusable. Using an inflatable dinghy, he sails for Pontevedra, but is intercepted by a group of ragged, armed Russian sailors led by their captain Ushakov. One of the crew, a former Ukrainian firefighting pilot named Viktor Pritchenko, informs Manel that the Canaries have been quarantined and enlists his help in searching the area for supplies. Just before going to sleep, Manel witnesses another group of refugees arriving and asking for help, but the next morning Pritchenko denies they ever arrived, and later Manel sees the crew rifling through the refugees' possessions. No longer feeling safe, Manel tells Pritchenko about a helicopter at a hospital in Pontevedra, where his wife died, hoping Pritchenko will allow him to escape, but he cannot persuade him. Manel then tries to flee on his own, but is forced to detour through the bowels of the ship, where he finds two of the refugees imprisoned. While trying to free them, he is discovered by a guard, who shoots one of the prisoners. Pritchenko intervenes and kills the guard, and the three steal a motorboat to escape. As they depart, the remaining refugee is killed by the guards, and Pritchenko is wounded. When Manel and Pritchenko make it to the hospital, they find the helicopter gone. Manel takes Pritchenko into the hospital to treat his injuries, but while searching the building, he finds a nurse named Lucia, a nun named Cecilia, and three children holed up inside. After treating Pritchenko, Lucia shows Manel another helicopter in a courtyard overrun by the zombies. Soon after, Ushakov's men arrive at the hospital looking for supplies. Forced to evacuate through a subterranean boiler complex, the group is attacked by a zombie; Cecilia is infected and remains behind. The rest make it to the helicopter and seal off the landing pad, but are intercepted by Ushakov and his men before they can take off. Manel cuts open the lock to the pad's fence, allowing the zombies to pour in and overwhelm Ushakov. Manel climbs aboard the departing helicopter, and the group escapes. As they near the Canaries, Manel manages to contact Belén. To their horror, Belén frantically warns them to stay away, and two fighter jets pass them.",

One day earlier, guitar technician Beth discovers that she is pregnant and goes to her estranged sister Ellie for help. Ellie informs Beth that her husband has left the family, leaving her to take care of her three kids – Danny, Bridget, and Kassie – alone in their Los Angeles apartment. After the siblings return from dinner, an intense earthquake uncovers a hidden chamber beneath the parking lot. Danny investigates it, discovering religious artifacts, three phonograph records from 1923, and a strange book that he takes up to his room, hoping to sell it and help Ellie. The initial record details rejected efforts by a priest to research the book, revealed to be one of three volumes of the Naturom Demonto. The subsequent record reveals the priest continued his research in secret and recites an incantation that summons demonic entities known as Deadites. The building's power fails and an unseen force possesses Ellie. She returns to the apartment in a trance, menacingly threatens her family, and dies after pleading with Beth to protect her children. Ellie's neighbors help lay her to rest in her bedroom and search for a way out. They find that the staircase has collapsed, the elevator is damaged, and they are unable to access the fire escape before Ellie revives and attacks the family, wounding Beth and Bridget. Beth and the children lock Ellie outside the apartment after she pursues and massacres the neighbors. Danny confesses to Beth about recovering the Naturom Demonto, and Ellie tricks Kassie into unlocking the door before attacking her. While Danny and Beth are distracted rescuing Kassie and locking Ellie out, Bridget's wound festers and she is possessed. Bridget attacks Beth before turning on Danny and Kassie, who inadvertently impales her through the head with a broken broom handle. Beth listens to the third record to understand how to exorcise the Deadites, but learns the priest failed and his allies were all possessed, with only complete destruction of the host stopping the Deadites. Bridget revives and fatally stabs Danny, who sets Bridget on fire before dying as Ellie infiltrates the apartment using the vents. Realizing Beth is pregnant, Ellie attempts to rip the fetus out of her, but Beth and Kassie incapacitate her with scissors.

The Marauder captures Kassie and attempts to behead her with a chainsaw, but Beth returns and distracts it. She and Kassie destroy the Marauder's body by forcing it into a wood chipper. Ellie's severed head taunts Beth, saying she will be a failure as a mother, prompting her to kick Ellie's head into the chipper. Beth and Kassie escape the building together.

    "plot": "One year after the explosion of Flight 180, college student Kimberly Corman is heading to Daytona Beach, Florida, for spring break with her friends Shaina, Dano, and Frankie. On the entrance ramp to U.S. Route 23, she has a premonition of a deadly pile-up caused by a logging truck. Kimberly stalls her car and exits, preventing eight people from entering Route 23: state trooper Thomas Burke, high school teacher Eugene Dix, stoner Rory Peters, businesswoman Kat Jennings, widowed mother Nora Carpenter and her fifteen-year-old son Tim, lottery winner Evan Lewis, and pregnant delivery driver Isabella Hudson. As Burke questions Kimberly, the pile-up occurs, and a car carrier crashes into Kimberly's car, killing Shaina, Dano, and Frankie. Burke pulls Kimberly away from the crash in time, saving her life. The survivors return to their respective homes, where a fire escape ladder fatally impales Evan when he attempts to flee from a stovetop fire in his apartment. Sensing Death's presence, Kimberly seeks help from Clear Rivers, who has hidden from Death in a psychiatric ward after Alex Browning was killed by a falling brick, making her the last survivor of Flight 180. Clear tells Kimberly that their survival provoked Death to kill them in the order they would have died at Route 23 but concludes that Death must be working backwards since Kimberly's friends died before Evan – while Kimberly survived because of Burke's intervention – unlike in Kimberly's premonition, where they all died after Evan. Clear also tells Kimberly to look for omens and save herself, warning her that Burke's rescue merely puts her after him on Death's list. Kimberly sees omens of Tim's death but fails to save him from being crushed by a glass pane. Clear decides to leave the ward and introduces Kimberly and Burke to a mortician, William Bludworth, who tells them that only \"new life\" can defeat Death. Burke holds Isabella in custody under false charges to protect her, believing that the birth of her baby would create the loophole they need to ruin Death's design. He gathers the other survivors in his apartment for safety, but when Nora leaves, a chain reaction causes the doors of an elevator to decapitate her. Eugene attempts suicide with Burke's gun, but it repeatedly misfires; Clear rationalizes that it is not Eugene's turn to die. The survivors ride in Kat's SUV after learning that Isabella was hospitalized to give birth. Along the way, the survivors reveal that the deaths of Flight 180 survivors inadvertently saved them from fatal incidents before Route 23's pile-up, creating ripple effects that Death resolves by reversing its list. The SUV suddenly blows a tire and crashes into a farm owned by the Gibbons family. Kat is pinned in her seat while the others escape. Rescue workers hospitalize Eugene, while one of them accidentally causes Kat to be impaled by a PVC pipe. Her death triggers a chain reaction that causes barbed wire to be launched in Rory's direction, fatally dismembering him. Kimberly, Clear, and Burke rush to Isabella's ward after Kimberly has a vision of a doctor named Kalarjian apparently killing Isabella. However, they see that Isabella has safely given birth to her baby, causing Kimberly to remember that Isabella was never supposed to die on Route 23. Suddenly, an oxygen leak from Eugene's ward explodes and kills both him and Clear. Kimberly realizes that she must die clinically and be resuscitated, thus creating the loophole that defeats Death. She drives an ambulance into a lake and is revived by Dr. Kalarjian. Later, Kimberly and Burke picnic with the Gibbons and Kimberly's father. The Gibbons tell the story of Brian, their son, being saved from a speeding news van by Rory. As Kimberly and Burke realize the implications, Brian is killed when a malfunctioning propane grill explodes while he is grilling.",

Chris hosts a party with Karras's friend, Father Dyer, who explains Karras's role as counselor and notes his mother's recent death. Regan, seemingly unwell, appears and urinates before Chris comforts her. Regan's bed shakes violently after Chris returns her to it. Later, Dyer consoles Karras, guilty at not having been with his mother when she died. Regan's personality becomes violent, and medical tests find no physical cause. During a house call, Regan exhibits abnormal strength and adult behaviour, and speaks in an otherworldly voice. One night, Chris finds the house empty except for a sleeping Regan; Dennings had been left with her but is found dead at the bottom of a set of public stairs that begin beneath Regan's window. Detective William Kinderman questions Karras, confiding that Dennings's head was turned backward. Kinderman tells Chris that the only plausible explanation for Dennings's death is that he was pushed from Regan's window. As Kinderman leaves, a scarred and bloody Regan has another violent fit, furiously masturbating with a crucifix, turning her head backward and speaking in the voice of Dennings. She is confined to her bedroom and strapped to the bed. Now convinced that her daughter is possessed, Chris seeks out Karras, who visits Regan. The possessed Regan claims to be the Devil, and vomits into Karras's face while speaking in tongues. The demon says it will remain in Regan until she is dead. At night, Chris's assistant Sharon calls Karras to the house, where the words 'help me' appear on Regan's stomach; he concludes that an exorcism is warranted. His superior grants permission on the condition that an experienced priest lead the ritual. Merrin, having performed an exorcism before, is summoned. Merrin arrives at the house. As the two priests read from the Roman Ritual, the demon curses them. The priests rest and Merrin, shaking, takes nitroglycerin. Karras enters the bedroom where the demon appears as his mother, perturbing Karras despite his denials. Merrin excuses Karras and continues the exorcism by himself. Chris approaches Karras and asks if Regan will die. He assures her that she will not and re-enters the room, finding Merrin dead from a heart attack while Regan watches and laughs. Karras beats the possessed Regan in a fit of rage and demands that the demon take him instead. The demon rips the medallion of Saint Joseph from Karras's neck and possesses him, freeing Regan in the process. Karras jumps out the window, tumbling down the stone stairs outside. Chris and Kinderman enter the room. Chris embraces the freed Regan, and Kinderman surveys the scene. Outside, Dyer administers the dying Karras his last rites. The MacNeils prepare to leave, and Father Dyer says goodbye. Despite having no memory of her ordeal, Regan, moved by the sight of Dyer's clerical collar, kisses him on the cheek. As the MacNeils leave, Chris gives Dyer the medallion found in Regan's room. Dyer briefly examines the steps where Karras died before walking away.",

    "title": "The Purge: Anarchy",
    "plot": "In 2023, as people across America prepare for the annual Purge, where all crimes are legalized, an anti-Purge resistance group formed by Carmelo Johns hacks into live feeds to denounce the NFFA. In Los Angeles, waitress Eva Sanchez returns home to her daughter Cali and terminally ill father Rico. As Eva and Cali prepare to barricade themselves, Rico slips out to a waiting limousine. He has offered to be killed by a wealthy family in exchange for money paid to Eva and Cali. Meanwhile, estranged married couple Shane and Liz visit a grocery store, only to be harassed by a masked gang of skateboarders and dirt bikers. Their car breaks down, having been tampered with by the biker gang. Off-duty LAPD sergeant Leo Barnes plots to kill Warren Grass. The day before the previous year's Purge, Grass struck Leo's son Nicholas while driving drunk, but was acquitted due to Nicholas dying on Purge night. Ignoring his ex-wife Janice's pleas, Leo loads up and drives out into the streets. As Liz and Shane try to find safer hiding places, the Purge commences. Eva and Cali notice NFFA paramilitary amassing in the street below, and the superintendent, Diego, enters her apartment. Diego is gunned down by a paramilitary platoon, which captures the women to offer them to their leader, Big Daddy. Leo passes by and rescues Eva and Cali after killing the troops and wounding Big Daddy. They find Shane and Liz hiding in Leo's car. The group flees just as Big Daddy fires at them. After Leo's car breaks down, the group flees on foot. As the group navigates the hostile streets, they find a paramilitary van surrounded by soldiers who were shot by the resistance fighters. After freeing Shane from a trap and taking guns from the abandoned truck, they head to the subways. They pass by a harmless homeless encampment, but soon after, find themselves being chased by a rampaging Pyrotechnic purging gang that invades the subway and sets the tunnel ablaze. Shane is wounded, but the group manages to escape after he and Liz destroy the gang's all-terrain vehicle and its propane tank with the salvaged guns. The group returns to the streets, but as they near Eva’s friend Tanya's apartment building, Eva unknowingly signals a traffic camera to identify them to the paramilitary troops. They reach Tanya's house, and Tanya's family takes them in. However, Tanya's sister Lorraine murders her sister for sleeping with her husband. The group leaves the family, only to be captured by the masked gang who ambushed Shane and Liz earlier. The gang sells them to an auction, taking them to a theater where upper-class Purgers bid on them for human hunting. After the group is forced into the arena, Leo subdues and kills a Purger, taking his weapon and night vision device, overpowering and killing several other attackers, before the head Purger calls in security. Shane is shot and killed by security forces just before the anti-Purge group attacks the compound, killing the security forces and remaining Purgers; Liz chooses to stay with the resistance fighters while Leo, Eva, and Cali leave. Leo steals a car and drives off with Eva and Cali, heading for Warren Grass. Despite Eva and Cali's pleas to abandon his revenge plans, Leo enters the house to confront Warren. As Leo exits the house, he is shot by Big Daddy, who reveals that the NFFA secretly dispatches death squads to increase the body count because the purge has been eliminating too few people of the lower class. Just as Big Daddy is about to kill Leo, Warren kills Big Daddy, revealing that Leo chose to forgive and spare him. Just as Big Daddy's death squad appears and Eva, Cali, and Warren prepare to defend themselves, sirens blare to signal the end of the purge (making Big Daddy's death legal and sparing Leo). Warren takes Eva, Cali, and Leo to the hospital as news and police helicopters fly over the city.",

    "plot": "Philadelphia firefighter Cooper Abbott takes his teenage daughter, Riley, to pop star Lady Raven's concert as a reward for her good grades. Noticing the unusually high police presence around the concert venue, Cooper learns from a vendor named Jamie that the FBI has learned a serial killer named \"the Butcher\" will be in attendance. Cooper, who is revealed to be the Butcher, secretly checks footage on his phone of his latest captive victim, Spencer, who he is holding in a basement. He steals Jamie's ID card and learns the passphrase that will identify him as an employee, using the card to gain access to a back room and steal a police radio. Hearing a woman predicting his movements over the radio, Cooper sets off an explosion in a food stand's kitchen and uses the chaos to access the roof, where he learns from a police officer that the manhunt is led by Dr. Josephine Grant, an FBI profiler. Confused by Cooper's behavior, Riley asks him to stay with her. She says she hopes to be chosen as Lady Raven's \"Dreamer Girl\", who gets to dance on stage with the singer and receives backstage access. Believing the backstage exit is not covered by the police, Cooper meets Lady Raven's uncle, one of the spotters, and lies to him that Riley recently recovered from leukemia, leading to her selection as the \"Dreamer Girl”. After the concert ends, Cooper learns that the police are also guarding the backstage exit. He privately reveals himself as the Butcher to Lady Raven, threatening to kill Spencer remotely if she does not escort him and Riley out in her limousine. She complies but asks to come to Riley's house, where she stalls for time by explaining the FBI operation to the family, unsettling Cooper by describing Grant's profile of him as someone with maternal issues and obsessive–compulsive disorder. She also explains that the police discovered details about the Butcher's attendance at the concert via a torn ticket receipt left in a vacant house that was reported anonymously. Lady Raven steals Cooper’s phone and locks herself in the bathroom. She obtains details from Spencer about where he was taken and livestreams it to her fans, one of whom finds and rescues him. She reveals Cooper's identity as the Butcher to his wife Rachel, and he locks his family upstairs while Lady Raven texts her driver to contact the police. Cooper attempts to drive off with Lady Raven, but Cooper's family escapes and distracts him long enough for her to flee into her limousine. The police arrive and Cooper flees the house through a secret tunnel before disguising himself using a SWAT uniform and driving the limousine off with Lady Raven. After he reveals his identity, she unlocks the window and incites a mob of fans to swarm the car so the FBI can catch up. Cooper changes into a fresh set of civilian clothes and gets away. Cooper returns home and confronts Rachel. Rachel confesses that she suspected he was the Butcher, left the receipt in the vacant house for the police to find, and reported it. Cooper decides to kill her and then himself, but Rachel persuades him to share some leftover pie she made for Riley. After Cooper expresses his rage at Rachel for causing him to miss seeing his children grow up, he realizes Rachel drugged the pie with pills from his tool bag, causing him to hallucinate his mother expressing pride in him for feeling a real emotion. He is captured by Grant and two SWAT officers as he walks up to her. As he is led away, he stops to adjust Riley's bicycle and shares a tearful embrace with her before being loaded into a police van. In the back of the van, Cooper unlocks his cuffs with a spoke he secretly took from Riley's bike and laughs to himself. Later, Jamie is shocked to find out that Cooper was the Butcher while watching the news, after shockingly exclaiming that he had helped him. He vows not to talk to anyone at work anymore.",

    "plot": "In 1673 Mexico, a family plays in a field, and the youngest son gives his mother a necklace, who says she will treasure the item forever. The boy goes on a hike a while later and finds his mother violently drowning his brother in a stream. Horrified, he runs, but his mother catches him; he is assumed to be drowned as well. 300 years later, in 1973 Los Angeles, caseworker Anna investigates the truancy of client Patricia Alvarez's two children. Arriving at Patricia's house for a welfare check, she finds the children locked behind a door. After she insisted and though she was warned to get away from the door, Patricia attacks her and is taken away by the police. Patricia's sons, Carlos and Tomas, tell Anna to keep them in the room, so they are protected. Ignoring their warnings, she takes them to the child-services shelter, unaware that she put them in terrible danger. There, Tomas sleepwalks, and Carlos follows him until both boys see a woman in a white dress who attacks them. The boys are found drowned in a river, and Anna is called out to the scene. She brings her own children, Chris and Sam, and they stay in the car while she investigates. She hears Patricia, accused of her sons' murders, screaming that it was Anna's fault for taking her sons and that Patricia had tried to stop the malevolent force of \"La Llorona.\" Chris leaves the car out of curiosity and encounters La Llorona (English: The Weeping Woman), who seizes his wrist and leaves burns. She stalks him back to the car, but leaves once Anna returns and the family flees the scene. The next day, Anna meets with Father Perez about whether or not to believe the myth of La Llorona. In the process, Anna and her family begin to experience a series of unexplained incidents. La Llorona also grabs Sam and leaves identical burn marks the next day. Anna interviews Patricia, who has an alibi for the time of her sons' deaths. However, Patricia reveals that in her hatred for Anna, she prayed to La Llorona to bring her own boys back and take Anna's children instead. Soon after, Anna encounters La Llorona when the spirit attempts to drown Sam in the bathtub. The ghost leaves burn marks on Anna's arm too. Anna seeks help from Father Perez, who relates the case to his previous experiences with a haunted porcelain doll. Perez tells Anna about former priest Rafael Olvera, who has since become a folk shaman or \"curandero\", who may be able to help them. Rafael arrives at Anna's house, setting up items for protection. In the night, La Llorona repeatedly attacks them and attempts to drown Anna and Sam in the pool. Anna pulls off La Llorona's necklace in the struggle. Patricia arrives with a gun and tries to give Anna's children to La Llorona. Sam and Chris flee. Patricia, realizing that she can't let another mother feel the same pain she felt or bring her children back to life, comes to her senses and releases Anna, allowing her to help her children. Chris delays La Llorona by showing her the necklace that La Llorona's son had given her. This makes La Llorona briefly assume her human appearance and caress Chris, imagining him to be her real son. However, Sam accidentally unveils a mirror, and La Llorona reverts and proceeds to attack them. Anna stabs her through the chest with a cross made from a Fire Tree given by Rafael: trees that grew by the river where La Llorona drowned her children and were the only \"witness\" to her crime. The spirit is destroyed. Anna and her children thank Rafael for his help. When he leaves, Anna looks down into a puddle of water beside the road.",

    "plot": "On the night of Halloween, 1963, in the suburban Illinois town of Haddonfield, six-year-old Michael Myers brutally stabs his teenage sister Judith to death with a chef's knife. Fifteen years later, his psychiatrist Dr. Samuel Loomis drives with nurse Marion Chambers to the sanitarium where Michael is incarcerated to escort him to a court hearing. After Loomis exits their car to unlock the main gate, Michael jumps on the roof and attacks Marion. She runs from the vehicle, allowing Michael to steal the car and drive away. Michael makes his way to Haddonfield, killing a mechanic and stealing his coveralls before stealing a white mask from a hardware store. He begins stalking teenager Laurie Strode, whom he saw drop off a key at his long-abandoned childhood home that her father is attempting to sell. Laurie notices Michael throughout the day, but her friends Annie Brackett and Lynda Van Der Klok dismiss her concerns. Loomis arrives in Haddonfield and discovers that Michael has stolen Judith's tombstone from the local cemetery. He meets up with the town sheriff, Annie's father Leigh Brackett, and they search for Michael. That night, Michael follows Annie and Laurie to their babysitting jobs. Laurie watches Tommy Doyle, while Annie stays with Lindsey Wallace across the street. Michael spies on Annie and kills the Wallace family dog. Tommy spots Michael from the windows and thinks he is the boogeyman, but Laurie dismisses his concerns. Annie takes Lindsey to the Doyle house so she can pick up her boyfriend while Laurie watches both kids. Michael hides in her car and strangles her before cutting her throat. Lynda and her boyfriend Bob arrive at the Wallace house and have sex. Bob then goes downstairs to get a beer from the kitchen, where Michael pins him to the wall with a chef's knife. Michael poses as Bob in a ghost costume to taunt Lynda, who teases him to no effect. Annoyed, she calls Laurie to find out what happened to Annie, but Michael strangles her to death with the phone cord while Laurie listens on the other end, not knowing what is happening. Meanwhile, Loomis discovers the stolen car and searches the streets. Worried by the phone call, Laurie goes to the Wallace house and finds her friends' bodies and Judith's tombstone in the upstairs bedroom. She runs to the hallway where Michael slashes her arm, causing her to fall over the banister. Dazed, she escapes the house with Michael in pursuit. She makes it back to the Doyle house and tries to call for help, only to find the phone dead. Michael sneaks in through the window and attacks her again, but she stabs him in the neck with a knitting needle. Thinking Michael is dead, Laurie staggers upstairs to check on the children. While Tommy and Lindsey hide in the bathroom, Laurie hides in the bedroom closet. Michael reappears, and Laurie stabs him in the eye and in the chest. After she sends Tommy and Lindsey to a neighbor's house to call the police, Michael rises again. Seeing the children running from the house, Loomis investigates and sees Michael strangling Laurie. Loomis shoots him six times, knocking him off the balcony. When Loomis goes to check on the body, he is unsurprised to see that Michael has vanished. He stares into the distance as a traumatized Laurie sobs in terror while Michael's breathing can be heard in the Haddonfield night.",

    "plot": "Peter Banning, a workaholic lawyer fixated on success, has a strained relationship with his wife, Moira, and their children, 11-year-old Jack and 7-year-old Maggie, due to his constant absences and broken promises. During Christmas, the family travels to London to visit Moira's grandmother, Wendy Darling, who cared for Peter as an orphan. When Peter loses his temper with the children for interrupting a work call, Moira scolds him, reminding him how fleeting their time with the children is. During a dinner honoring Wendy’s work with orphans, the children stay home with her old friend, Tootles. Returning from the event, Peter and Moira discover Jack and Maggie are missing, with a note left behind signed by Captain James Hook. Wendy urges Peter to return to Neverland and rescue his children because he is Peter Pan. Having no memory of his childhood, Peter does not believe her until the fairy Tinker Bell arrives and flies him to Neverland. In the pirate town, Peter confronts Hook, who fails to recognize his once formidable rival. Hook challenges Peter to fly and save his children, but Peter fails. Dismayed at how pathetic Peter has become, Hook orders his execution, but Tinker Bell convinces him to give her three days to train Peter for their final battle. Peter is brought to the Lost Boys' hideout, now led by Rufio. They mock the grown man before them until the group ultimately recognizes him. They begin training Peter, urging him to abandon his uptight adult demeanor and embrace his imagination. Meanwhile, Hook's first mate, Smee, suggests turning Peter's children against him. Maggie resists, but Jack, hurt by Peter's broken promises and failure to save him, begins to side with Hook. While infiltrating the pirate town, Peter sees Jack playing in a baseball game organized by Hook, who has taken on a fatherly role. Devastated, Peter returns to the Lost Boys' camp with renewed determination. His shadow leads him to the ruins of Wendy's house, where he remembers his past: as an infant in the early 1900s, he ran away from his mother, fearing growing up and dying, and was brought to Neverland by Tinker Bell. Visiting his family later, he found they had a new child and assumed they had forgotten him. Peter met Wendy, who fell in love with him, but as she aged and started a family, Peter fell for her granddaughter, Moira, and remained with her. Recalling Jack's birth as his happiest memory, Peter regains his powers and ability to fly. That night, a heartbroken Tinker Bell confesses her unrequited love to Peter. The next day, Peter and the Lost Boys launch an attack on the pirates. While Peter rescues Maggie, Rufio is fatally wounded in a duel with Hook. Witnessing Rufio's dying wish for a father like Peter, Jack reconciles with his father. Peter prepares to leave Neverland with his children, but Hook demands a final battle, vowing to eternally stalk Peter's descendants if denied. With help from Tinker Bell and the Lost Boys, Peter subdues Hook, who feigns surrender. Hook tries to stab Peter, but misses and impales the taxidermied Crocodile that once ate his hand. The Crocodile appears to come to life, topples over, and consumes Hook. Tinker Bell then returns Jack and Maggie home while Peter bids farewell to the Lost Boys, appointing Thud Butt as their new leader. Thud Butt gives Peter a bag of marbles that belonged to Tootles, a former Lost Boy. Peter awakens in London, where Tinker Bell tearfully bids him farewell. Transformed by his journey, Peter joyfully reunites with his family and discards his work phone. He returns the bag to Tootles, who sprinkles the pixie dust within on himself and flies off to Neverland. When Wendy observes that Peter's adventures are over, he replies, \"To live will be an awfully big adventure.\"",

The scientist agrees and retreats to the hallway to a vending machine. The janitor accidentally knocks off a life monitor attached to a man; in his attempt to revive the man, he gives chest compressions but his hands rip through the flesh as the man awakens and attacks the janitor. Moments later, the zombified janitor attacks the scientist in the hallway. Three high school sophomores, Ben, Carter, and Augie, are trying to recruit new members for their Scout group, led by their Scout Leader Rogers. While Augie has always been happy about being a Scout, Ben and Carter have second thoughts since they're growing out of favor and considering quitting the scouts. En route to a campsite, Ben accidentally hits a deer. They manage to get help from Carter's sister, Kendall (on whom Ben has a crush), and her friends. They return to the accident site, only to find that the dead deer has vanished. Before they leave, the two are invited to the \"Secret Seniors Party\", and Carter is given the address. Meanwhile, while trying to meet the boys in the woods, Rogers is attacked and killed by the deer and the zombified scientist. When they get alcohol for the party, they meet Denise, a cocktail waitress who works at a strip club. She and Ben hit it off, and she agrees to buy the alcohol for them. The two then meet up with Augie in the woods so they can set up their campsite. That night, Carter wakes Ben so they can attend the party. Augie catches them, however, and is disappointed by their choice. Ben and Carter drive into town to find that the bouncer for the strip club is no longer there, and they sneak in. They are attacked by the zombified bouncer and stripper before being saved by Denise. Augie goes to Rogers' house to find him, only to be attacked by the now zombified Rogers. Augie manages to incapacitate him and flee the scene. Ben, Carter, and Denise go to the police station to discover that the town has been evacuated, before a zombie horde chases them into a holding cell, whose door snaps shut, trapping them. Augie arrives and turns on a car radio, luring the zombies outside, and unlocks the cell. The fugitives make their way to the freeway, where they are picked up by US Army Corporal Reeves. They drive to the party to see if anyone is evacuated, only to find that the address that was sent to Carter was fake. Tensions rise amongst the group, but Reeves was bitten before meeting them and turns into a zombie. Denise kills him, and trying to get a signal on his radio, they overhear information about the Army intending to bomb the town to wipe out the zombies. Carter remembers that Kendall's diary has the party information in it; the four take Reeve's humvee and drive to Carter's house. They find the diary, but more zombies arrive and chase after them. They escape using a trampoline to get to the house of now zombified neighbor Ms. Fielder, take her car and head off down the road, until they find a dirt bike down the road and Denise takes it so she can get the military. Now left by themselves, Ben, Carter, and Augie build themselves weapons at a hardware store and head to the party. The zombies find the party and attack the partygoers, until the trio turns up and evacuates the survivors. Once they run out of ammo, they lock themselves in the building and the zombies follow them upstairs. They barricade themselves in the gym, and Augie reveals that he's built a bomb that was hidden in Ben's backpack. He manages to light the fuse just as the zombies burst in, and the three escape through a garbage chute just before the bomb explodes, killing the zombies. Denise and the military arrive at the scene, helping the survivors. The scouts reconcile their friendship, and Ben, with Denise's encouragement, starts a relationship with Kendall.",

She stops to help him, but he bites her lips off, revealing himself as one of the cannibals. She flees but runs into Three Finger, who splits her in half with his axe. Three Finger and Brother drag her body halves away. The Apocalypse: Ultimate Survivalist, a survival reality game show hosted by former U.S. Marine Colonel Dale Murphy, is in production at the West Virginia forest. Because of Kimberly's absence, the show's producer Mara reluctantly takes her place. Other contestants include: lesbian Iraq war veteran Amber, lingerie model Elena, former football player Jake, skateboarder Jonesy, and graphic artist Nina. As the game starts, Three Finger and another mutant cannibal, Pa, murder the television crew and abduct Dale. Mara finishes a task and enters a cabin to find a telephone, and Nina follows her. While looking around the cabin, they hear the occupants return and hide in a bedroom. Mara and Nina witness a female cannibal, Ma, giving birth to a deformed baby. They are spotted by Ma's daughter, Sister, and escape through the toilet pit. They run into the woods, but Pa throws a hatchet which hits Mara in the head. Nina searches for the others as the cannibals collect Mara's corpse. At the lake, cinematographer M and Elena have sex before the former leaves, and Elena stays to tan in her underwear. When she hears a noise, she starts to get dressed as Sister emerges and slashes her to death with a machete while Pa and Ma hijack the RV and capture M. Dale escapes captivity and battles Three Finger, ending the fight by shooting the cannibal into the lake with a shotgun. He then enters the mutant family's cabin. He finds the old gas station attendant, who reveals how the cannibals' mutations were caused by inbreeding and consumption of effluent dumped in the river from an abandoned paper mill 30 years ago. The man, who is revealed to be the grandfather of Three Finger and the two other inbred mountain men who have been killed, attacks Dale to avenge their deaths. After a brief skirmish, Dale kills the old man by blowing him up with a stick of dynamite. Meanwhile, when Nina returns to explain her story, the three other contestants are eating some meat found by Amber and Jonesy. They then realize that they have been eating Kimberly's leg. They attempt to escape, but Nina gets separated from the group while they fight Brother and Sister. Jake rescues Nina from a pit, and they jump into the river to escape Sister. After Amber and Jonesy are killed while looking for help, Nina and Jake enter the mill and find a garage with vehicles stolen from prior victims. They find the RV, and Jake enters it only to witness Ma decapitating M on a live feed monitor inside. Nina and Jake attempt to leave, but the cannibals capture them. The next day, Dale sneaks into the compound to distract the cannibal family who were eating dinner. He kills Brother and Sister with a dynamite stick attached to an arrow. He frees Nina and Jake but is killed by Ma and Pa, who are incensed by the deaths of their children. Nina successfully escapes, but Jake wanders into a room fitted with a large meat grinder, where he is attacked by Ma and Pa. Nina returns to the mill and kills Ma and Pa with the meat grinder. Nina and Jake find Kimberly's sportscar and drive away. Three Finger, who survives being shot by Dale, nurses the mutant baby, feeding it with a bottle of effluent and a human finger.",

Shelly, a friendly waitress at the diner, drives the couple to a secluded Airbnb cabin in the woods for them to stay the night. That night, as Maya and Ryan settle into the cabin, a mysterious young woman (Pin-Up Girl) knocks on the front door, asking if \"Tamara is home\"; the couple dismisses her. Realizing he left his inhaler behind in the car, Ryan goes back into town using a motorcycle from the Airbnb to retrieve it. While alone in the house, Maya is unnerved when, once again, Pin-Up Girl comes to the door asking for Tamara. In an attempt to relax, Maya decides to take a shower. While she showers, Scarecrow silently watches her. When the power goes out, Maya attempts to find a fuse box, but encounters Dollface and hides in an upstairs closet in fear. Ryan returns, dismissing the incident as a hallucination, as Maya had smoked marijuana earlier. Outside, they find Pin-Up Girl watching them from a distance; Ryan chases her off. While eating dinner, Maya and Ryan are horrified to find a dead chicken with its throat slit hanging from the ceiling. As the three masked perpetrators break into the house, Maya and Ryan barricade themselves in a bedroom. Scarecrow smashes the door open with his axe and stares at the couple, before leaving the house. The couple tries to escape with the motorcycle, but it is blown to smithereens by Scarecrow. Using the home's crawl space, they narrowly avoid being found as Maya accidentally stabs her hand on a nail. Upon exiting the crawl space, the couple finds a nearby shed. Ryan finds a shotgun and rescues Maya from being attacked by Pin-Up Girl and Scarecrow. As the couple leaves the shed, Ryan hears footsteps on the front porch and fires the shotgun, only to find that he has killed Joe, the property's owner. They attempt to escape in Joe's car, but Scarecrow repeatedly rams the car with his truck. When Ryan's leg becomes stuck, he urges Maya to run away. Ryan unsuccessfully attempts to shoot Scarecrow, who flees into the woods. Hiding in the woods, Maya calls 9-1-1 on Joe's cell phone despite the poor signal. While talking to the operator, she discovers Jeff's decaying corpse. As Maya tries to find her way back to the cabin, Dollface knocks her out and drags her away. Meanwhile, Ryan holds Pin-Up Girl at gunpoint, demanding to know Maya's whereabouts. Scarecrow knocks him out as well. Both awaken tied to chairs in the house. In their last moments together, Ryan proposes to Maya, and she tearfully accepts. Pin-Up Girl fatally stabs Ryan in the stomach before Scarecrow knocks his chair over, leaving him to bleed out. Maya demands to know why they are doing this, to which Pin-Up Girl replies, \"Because you're here.\" Scarecrow then stabs Maya in the stomach and knocks her chair over as well. Police sirens are heard in the distance as the perpetrators flee the scene. The next night, Maya awakens in a hospital bed, having survived the ordeal. As she rises from the bed, Scarecrow is lying beside her.",

    "plot": "High school student Alex Browning boards Volée Airlines Flight 180, a Boeing 747, with his classmates for their senior trip to Paris from John F. Kennedy Airport. Before take-off, Alex has a premonition that the plane will face a mechanical failure, leading to a mid-air explosion that causes an aviation accident, killing everybody on board. When the events from his vision begin to occur in reality, he panics until a fight breaks out between him and student Carter Horton, resulting in both of them being removed from the plane, along with Alex's best friend Tod Waggner, Carter's girlfriend Terry Chaney, teacher Valerie Lewton, and students Billy Hitchcock and Clear Rivers. None of them, except Clear, believe Alex about his vision until the plane explodes on take-off. Afterwards, the survivors are interrogated by two FBI agents, Weine and Schreck, who are both suspicious of Alex. Thirty-nine days later, after attending a memorial service for the victims, an unusual chain reaction causes Tod to accidentally hang himself in his shower that night. While his death is ruled a suicide, Alex sneaks into the funeral home along with Clear to examine Tod's corpse when mortician William Bludworth reveals that the survivors who escaped from the impending circumstance have disrupted Death's plan and that Death is now claiming the lives of those who were meant to die in the accident. Alex and Clear are discussing their next move when the rest of the survivors arrive outside a café, where Terry is run over by a speeding bus. After watching a news report on the cause of the explosion, Alex concludes that Death is reclaiming the survivors in the order they would have died in the disaster. Nonetheless, he is too late to save Ms. Lewton, whose house explodes after a falling kitchen knife impales her. The remaining survivors reunite while driving through town as Alex explains the situation. Still skeptical of Alex's theory, Carter stops his car at a train crossing to prove he is wrong. Alex, Clear, and Billy manage to escape, but Carter, realizing his impending fate, is still trapped in his car. Alex manages to save him just before the car is smashed by an oncoming train that knocks a piece of shrapnel from the wreckage into the air, decapitating Billy. Alex deduces that because he intervened in Carter's death, it skipped to the next person in the sequence. While hiding in a fortified cabin the next day, Alex recalls never changing seats with two students to sit directly next to Tod and realizes that Clear is actually next. He rushes to her house to save her while Weine and Schreck pursue him. Alex finds Clear trapped inside her car, surrounded by loose electrical cables that ignite a gasoline leak around her. He grabs the cable, allowing her to escape the car just before it explodes. Six months later, Alex travels to Paris with Clear and Carter to celebrate their survival. While discussing their ordeal, Alex reveals that Death never skipped him after he saved Clear. Fearing their struggle is unfinished, Alex retreats when a bus collision hurls a parking sign towards a neon sign that begins falling towards him. Carter pushes Alex out of the way at the last second, but the sign swings back towards Carter and kills him.",

    "plot": "In a dystopian future, the world suffers from food shortages and disasters caused by climate change, with melting ice caps releasing bacteria millions of years old. Thailand has barely managed to stay afloat thanks to innovative but risky experiments like insect breeding and is ruled in a decrepit condition by a police state. Singh, a former Muay Thai fighter, wants to return to his hometown of Chiang Dao to start a quiet life with his girlfriend Rin, a doctor. On his final mission, Singh travels to Bangkok with his superior, Kriang, to deliver containers carrying fish from a sunken freighter on behalf of VS Corporation, a powerful agricultural company. Unbeknownst to them, the fish is contaminated by an unknown pathogen, which makes a senior official of VS ill. He is taken to the hospital where Rin is working and dies before reanimating and biting patients and staff, starting a zombie infection that leads to the hospital being locked down. Learning of the announcement over a PA system, Singh sneaks into the hospital and fights his way to search for Rin, who is hiding upstairs. Along the way, he meets Rin's friend, a boy named Buddy who tells him to incapacitate the zombies by hitting them in the head. The military orders commandos to rescue Vasu, the head of VS, who is in a secure location of the hospital alongside his wife Anne, who is confined in a hospital in a coma for an incurable disease, before blowing up the hospital with pre-planted explosives to prevent the outbreak from spreading. Rin, who had previously taken care of Anne, manages to reach his room. Vasu guarantees Rin's safety in exchange for taking care of Anne, only to abandon Rin when the commandos arrive with their own medic to extract the couple. Meanwhile Singh and Buddy reach the latter's mother Meena, a nurse at the neonatal ward. Meena tells Singh of Rin's whereabouts and entrusts Buddy to his care before sending them away. As Buddy tries to return, Meena reveals herself to be infected and reanimates in front of them before devouring the infants in the ward, prompting Buddy and Singh to leave. After being abandoned by Vasu, Rin is cornered by zombies but is rescued by Singh and Buddy. As they try to escape, Singh is shot by the commandos who take Rin after the zombies kill their medic. As Rin is led away, Singh recovers and knocks down the commandos before collapsing from his injuries. As Rin treats him, Singh proposes to her and promises to return to Chiang Dao with her. Buddy discovers that the one of the commandoes has reanimated, forcing Singh to throw a molotov cocktail at him. The resulting fire activates the hospital's sprinklers and inadvertently reactivates the dormant zombies who chase after Singh and his group. As they escape, they come across Vasu and Anne, who had been bitten when the commandos were attacked. Vasu, believing that Anne has reawakened, allows himself to be overwhelmed by the zombies. Singh, Rin and Buddy make their way to the hospital's helipad, where the remaining commandos have landed a helicopter. Singh stays behind to divert the zombies to the hospital's car park, but is trapped by a swarm of zombies inside a car, forcing him to detonate an explosive which kills the zombies. Singh manages to escape and reach the helipad, but again decides to stay behind to stop more zombies following Rin and Buddy, who have been extracted by the commandos. As the helicopter takes off, Rin and Buddy tearfully watch as Singh fights the zombies before the building is demolished by the explosives. Rin arrives in Chiang Dao and is seen pondering while wearing Singh's ring. In a mid-credits scene, Singh is shown to have survived by seeking shelter inside a storage tank and kills a zombie as he emerges from the rubble of the hospital.",

    "plot": "Kevin Lomax is a Gainesville, Florida, defense attorney who has never lost a case. While defending schoolteacher Lloyd Gettys against a charge of child molestation, he realizes that his client is guilty. Nevertheless, he proceeds with his defense, destroying the victim's credibility through a harsh cross-examination and securing an acquittal for Gettys. A New York City law firm asks Kevin to assist them with a jury selection. After the jury delivers a not-guilty verdict, the head of the firm, John Milton, offers Kevin a job, and he and his wife Mary Ann move to Manhattan. Kevin is soon working long hours and neglecting Mary Ann. His Christian fundamentalist mother, Alice, urges the couple to return to Florida after meeting Milton. Kevin refuses. Kevin is assigned to represent billionaire Alex Cullen, who is accused of murdering his wife, his stepson, and a maid. As a result, Kevin sees even less of Mary Ann and fantasizes about his co-worker Christabella. Meanwhile, Mary Ann has demonic visions and has a nightmare about a baby playing with her removed ovaries. A doctor declares her to be infertile. Milton suggests that Kevin step down from the trial to care for Mary Ann's deteriorating mental health, but Kevin thinks he will resent her for costing him the case. Eddie Barzoon, the firm's managing partner, discovers Kevin's name on the firm's charter and believes that Kevin covets his job. Eddie threatens to inform the United States Attorney's office of the firm's dubious activities, and Kevin tells Milton. Although Milton seems to dismiss Kevin's concerns, Eddie is beaten to death in Riverside Park. Preparing Melissa Black, Alex Cullen's secretary, to testify, Kevin realizes that she is lying to give Cullen a false alibi. He tells Milton that he thinks Alex is guilty, but Milton offers to support him anyway. Kevin proceeds, winning an acquittal with Melissa's perjured testimony. Afterward, Mary Ann claims that Milton raped her that day and shows Kevin her body covered with cuts and scratches. Knowing that Milton was in court with him, Kevin believes her to be mentally ill and harming herself and admits her into a psychiatric institution. United States Department of Justice agent Mitch Weaver, who is investigating the clandestine activities of Milton's firm, warns Kevin that Milton is corrupt and reveals that Gettys, acquitted in Florida thanks to Kevin, has been arrested for killing a little girl. Moments later, Weaver is struck by a car and killed. Kevin, Alice, and his case manager, Pam Garrety, visit Mary Ann at the institution. Envisioning Pam as a demon, Mary Ann kills herself. Alice reveals that Milton is Kevin's father. Devastated, Kevin confronts Milton, who admits to raping Mary Ann. Kevin shoots Milton, but the bullets do not harm him. Milton reveals that he is Satan. Kevin blames Milton for everything that happened, but Milton points out that he merely \"set the stage\". It was Kevin who chose to neglect his wife and defend people he knew were guilty. Kevin realizes that he always wanted to win, regardless of the cost. Christabella arrives, and Milton reveals that she is Kevin's half-sister and he wants the two of them to conceive the Antichrist. Kevin initially appears to acquiesce but abruptly shoots himself in the head. Milton's demonic rage burns Christabella alive, and he turns into a winged angel that resembles Kevin. Suddenly, Kevin is again at the Gainesville courthouse during the recess of the Gettys trial. The entire experience was a vision. Kevin returns to the courtroom and sees that Mary Ann is alive and well. When the trial resumes, Kevin announces that he cannot represent his client, despite the risk of disbarment. Kevin's reporter friend Larry offers to do a high-profile interview with him, promising to make him famous. Encouraged by Mary Ann, Kevin agrees. After they leave, Larry transforms into Milton, who breaks the fourth wall and declares, \"Vanity—definitely my favorite sin\".",

    "plot": "A woman walking alone to town under the hot California sun is suddenly attacked by a shadowy figure and dragged into the brush. Nearly two decades after the events of Dracula, finds Mina Van Helsing (née Murray, formerly Harker) and Dr. Abraham Van Helsing married and living in the California Central Valley with their two sons, Max and Rudy. The young teens have grown up hearing stories of the dark things which haunt the night, and that they have had to move to ever-more-isolated locations in order to find peace from these terrible creatures. Abraham approaches his oldest son, Max, about Max's readiness to begin taking part in his father's fight against the darkness, and is tasked with watching his disturbed mother to keep her safe. Max is warned that Mina's mind is connected to the vampiric creatures (a reference to her being Dracula's thrall in the novel) and her behavior and mind will become more erratic if such creatures are near. The family's peace is disrupted with the arrival of surveyors for the Pacific Railroad plotting a new route which would pass close by their isolated home. An accident leads Eddie and Elsie, the brother/sister surveying team, to their front door seeking medical attention. Dr. Van Helsing saves Eddie's life, earning Elsie's gratitude. Mina's behavior becomes increasingly scattered and strange, but also more assured, as she converses with herself at night, withdraws from and resents the husband she was previously so \"grateful\" to for saving her and holding her vampiric influence at bay for so long, and describes Dracula in somewhat sensual terms to her children. Max has dreams about a shadowy figure, and Rudy is frightened that the vampires are already in the house, because he can hear scratching and muttering at night from the floors. Mina begins to physically fade, which Abraham attributes to the vampires' influence taking over at last, and he tries many remedies, from blood transfusions and tinctures, in order to help her regain her strength. While their father is out and their mother sleeping, Max and Rudy play football, until Rudy ducks through the window into their father's private study. Filled with strange occult objects and remnants from their past in London and Amsterdam before they fled to California, the boys find a hidden, locked door in the study. Opening it reveals stairs to a secret underground room, with a woman, the same from the beginning scene, chained in the darkness and begging for help. Before the boys can act, their father returns and stabs the woman through the heart. Laying the woman's body out, Abraham explains to his sons that she had been attacked by a vampire and it was necessary for him to capture and hold her there to see if she was turning. Abraham hands Max a stake and mallet, and instructs him in staking her through the heart, which Max does. Abraham then turns to the young Rudy and tells him to help cut the woman's head off. Rudy protests vehemently, and Max is struck when he attempts to step in and redirect their father. Abraham admonishes his sons to put their faith in him. Max discusses with Elsie his suspicions that his father might not be saving his mother, but actually making and keeping her sick. Before she dies, Mina asks her husband if he remembers the time \"he\" came to her bedroom and Van Helsing had \"rescued\" her. Abraham says yes, and Mina glares and wonders if he had actually saved her or simply trapped her himself and kept her there for all these years. Max contemplates running away and seems to be wondering if his father has truly been killing demons or if Abraham is simply murdering people, but he does not want to leave Rudy alone with their father. Max's nightmares about a shadowy vampiric figure continue. Arthur Holmwood hears of Mina's death and Van Helsing's presence in the valley and comes for a visit. Arthur is deeply disturbed by his memories of the events from Dracula and cannot sleep, decades later. He is plagued with doubts. Specifically, he doubts his young self's judgement in trusting Abraham so completely when the older man and authority figure told them all that Arthur's wife, Lucy Westenra, had become a demon and needed to be killed. Arthur questions the many dubious medical procedures Abraham required them to perform on Lucy before her death and begs Abraham to assure him he is not a murderer for following Abraham's direction to stake and decapitate his new bride. Abraham is furious. He reiterates that Lucy had become a demon and their actions were justified as he throws Arthur from his house. Max asks about visitor and some details about vampire bodies which Abraham has convenient, but unconvincing, answers for and shows Max a thick notebook containing photos of every vampire he has ever killed. Abraham tells Max he believes the family needs more secure protection and that they must set up a perimeter to isolate themselves, starting with the encroaching railroad team. Max tells his father he will not help and intends to leave. Van Helsing attacks and incapacitates his older son, before dragging young Rudy to the railroad camp to cleanse it. Van Helsing, having brought Rudy with him, kills one worker at the camp at night. The only other person at the camp who is awake is Elsie, and when she goes to investigate, Van Helsing drags her a short distance from the camp, where he gives Rudy a mallet and a stake and urges him to stake her. Rudy instead turns around and stakes Van Helsing in the abdomen, but Van Helsing removes the stake. Before Van Helsing can take any other action, however, Max, having escaped the house and heard Elsie's screams, attacks him with his woodcutting axe. The two brothers turn on their father, saying he must be killed to save others, which causes Abraham to gloat that they are just like him. Max then decapitates Van Helsing. Elsie, horrified by their actions, flees despite Max' repeated assertions that they are safe from Van Helsing now. The two brothers empty their house and prepare to leave for places unknown, while the audience listens to a monologue by Abraham about how his own father was indifferent to his existence, so if he is hard on his sons and has high expectations, it is because he loves them. The movie ends as the boys ride away on horses heavy with all of their belongings as the voice of their father assures them that their faith in him is warranted.",

    "plot": "One year after the Woodsboro killings orchestrated by Richie Kirsch and Amber Freeman, Blackmore University professor, Laura Crane, is catfished and murdered by her student, Jason Carvey, wearing a Ghostface costume. Jason plots with his roommate, Greg Bruckner, to kill sisters Sam and Tara Carpenter to finish the \"movie\" that Richie and Amber wanted to make. However, Jason receives a call from a different Ghostface, who has killed Greg and subsequently stabs Jason to death. The Carpenter sisters now reside in New York City, with Tara attending Blackmore University alongside fellow survivors and twins Chad and Mindy Meeks-Martin; their roommate, Quinn Bailey; Mindy's girlfriend, Anika Kayoko; and Chad's roommate, Ethan Landry. Sam attends therapy with Dr. Christopher Stone, and has become a public pariah because of an online conspiracy theory that she was the true mastermind of the recent killings. Quinn's father, Detective Wayne Baily, calls Sam in for questioning as her ID was found at the scene of Jason's murder, along with a Ghostface mask worn by Richie and Amber. On the way to the station, Ghostface calls Sam from Richie's number, then attacks Tara, kills multiple bystanders in a bodega, and leaves behind another Ghostface mask worn in the 2011 Woodsboro killings. At the NYPD police station, the Carpenter sisters meet with FBI special agent, Kirby Reed, a survivor of the 2011 killings, and reporter Gale Weathers, who has since written a new book about the previous Woodsboro killings, despite promising the sisters that she would not. Gale informs them that Sidney Prescott has gone into hiding to protect her family. Dr. Stone is murdered by Ghostface, who steals Sam's file and leaves behind a mask worn in the Hollywood killings. Mindy theorizes that the killer is following the rules of film franchises, specifically the rule that anyone can die while the franchise will still continue. From his window, Sam's boyfriend Danny witnesses Ghostface stabbing Quinn in the Carpenter sisters' apartment before attacking the group and killing Anika, leaving behind a mask worn in the Windsor College killings. Gale takes the group to an abandoned theater she found while investigating, which has been set up as a shrine to the Ghostface killers, featuring many items of evidence related to previous massacres now displayed like film props. Ghostface calls Gale at her apartment and torments her about Dewey Riley's death before killing her boyfriend and attacking her. The Carpenter sisters arrive just in time to stop Ghostface from killing Gale, who is taken to the hospital. The group agrees to meet Kirby at the theater to trap Ghostface. Mindy and Ethan are separated from the group and while hopping onto another train, Mindy is stabbed by Ghostface on the train. At the theater, Sam sees a hallucination of Billy Loomis. Taking his knife from the original murders, she realizes they have been locked inside. Two Ghostfaces appear and attack Chad. Wayne and Kirby both arrive with guns drawn and he shoots her, revealing himself as a third Ghostface and the mastermind. His accomplices are his children, revealed to be Ethan and a still-alive Quinn, who faked her death to ease suspicion. They reveal their motive is to take revenge on Sam for killing Richie, who was their brother and Wayne's first-born son. The trio were also responsible for the online smear campaign against Sam, having infiltrated her life with the intent of killing her. The Carpenter sisters ultimately gain the upper hand and fight them off, with Tara stabbing Ethan and Sam killing Quinn, while briefly rendering Wayne unconscious. Sam then dons her father's Ghostface costume, taunts Baily with a phone call, and stabs him to death. Ethan resurfaces, but Kirby smashes a television set over his head, killing him. Sam agrees to let Tara live her life more independently, and Tara agrees to go to therapy. As Kirby and the Meeks twins are taken to the hospital, Sam stares at her father's Ghostface mask before discarding it and following Tara and Danny into the city.",

    "plot": "Former United Nations investigator Gerald \"Gerry\" Lane, his wife, Karin, and their two daughters, Rachel and Connie, are caught in traffic in downtown Philadelphia when a zombie outbreak hits. Escaping the ensuing chaos, they travel to Newark and pick up Tommy, a young boy whose family hunkered down in their apartment and refused to leave. They are rescued by a helicopter sent by Thierry Umutoni, the UN deputy secretary-general. The group is then taken to a US Navy vessel stationed in the Atlantic Ocean, where a team of scientists studies the outbreak. Among them is virologist Andrew Fassbach, who believes that the plague is caused by a virus and that finding its origin is crucial for developing a vaccine. Faced with the threat of his family's eviction from the vessel, Gerry reluctantly agrees to assist Fassbach. Gerry, Fassbach, and a Navy SEAL escort fly to Camp Humphreys in South Korea, from where the first report of zombies was received. Upon arrival, the group is attacked by zombies, causing a panicked Fassbach to slip on the plane ramp and accidentally shoot himself dead. The team is saved by US soldiers stationed at the camp, and Gerry discovers that the infection was brought to the base by its doctor. A CIA officer imprisoned there guides Gerry towards Israel, where the Mossad has established a secure area. In Jerusalem, Gerry encounters Jurgen Warmbrunn, a high-ranking Mossad official, who mentions that intercepted communications of Indian troops fighting zombies is what led Israel to set up defenses. Jerusalem has protected itself by constructing a massive wall and allowing refugees to seek shelter within the city. However, the refugees' loud celebrations attract zombies, which instinctively form massive castells to overcome the wall. As the city becomes overrun, Warmbrunn instructs Israeli soldiers to accompany Gerry back to his plane. Amidst the mayhem, Gerry observes zombies ignoring an elderly man and a malnourished boy. When one of Gerry's escorts, \"Segen\", is bitten on her hand, he amputates it to prevent her from turning into a zombie. Together, they escape on a commercial airliner. Gerry redirects the plane to a World Health Organization medical research facility in Cardiff. During the journey, a stowaway zombie attacks the passengers. To eliminate the zombies, Gerry detonates a grenade to breach the cabin and expel them; resulting in the plane's crash landing. With Gerry presumed killed, his family is relocated from the carrier to Nova Scotia. Gerry and Segen survive the crash, although Gerry is trapped in his seat and has sustained injuries. Segen comes to Gerry's aid, and together, they reach the Cardiff facility. Exhausted and wounded, Gerry loses consciousness and wakes up three days later, having been treated by the WHO staff. Sharing his observations, Gerry deduces that the zombies ignore the sick or injured, as they are not suitable hosts for spreading the infection. He proposes injecting healthy individuals with a curable pathogen as a form of \"camouflage\" against the zombies. The pathogen samples are in a section of the WHO facility infested with zombies. Gerry, Segen, and the head doctor attempt to sneak through the lab but accidentally alert the zombies. The three are separated in a chaotic chase, with Segen and the doctor forced to retreat. Gerry, the only one able to reach the samples, does so but is unable to leave because of a lone zombie blocking his path. Out of options, Gerry tests his theory by injecting himself with a pathogen. As he opens the door, his theory is proven correct: the zombie ignores him completely. Gerry and Segen reach a secure area in Freeport, Nova Scotia, and are reunited with Karin, Gerry's daughters, and Tommy, who is now being raised by Karin and Gerry. A vaccine is created, serving as stealth against the zombies, enabling civilians to evacuate infected regions safely and empowering the military to combat the zombies more effectively.",

    "plot": "One year later after the massacre at Fairlake, two college students, Rich Stoker and Halley Smith, are rock climbing in a remote forest of West Virginia. Rich reaches the top of a cliff and before he can help Halley up, he is attacked and killed. Someone begins to yank Halley up the cliff, forcing her to cut the rope and fall to the ground. She flees but is caught in a line of barbed wire and pulled back into the woods, screaming. Sometime later, medical student Chris Flynn drives through the mountains of West Virginia on his way to a business meeting. He stops at a gas station to ask directions, and the elderly owner named Maynard is of no help. Chris finds a map and decides to go down Bear Mountain Road. He collides with a stopped car whose tires have been punctured. The car belongs to a group of college students on a camping trip: Jessie, Carly, Scott, Evan, and Francine. They discover that their tire actually hit barbed wires, which was intentionally laid by someone. While Evan and Francine watch the cars, the others go to find help. Evan disappears after he hears something from the woods, and Francine finds his ear on the ground. A mysterious figure garrottes Francine with a length of barb wire. The remaining group enters an isolated cabin and are horrified to find human body parts inside. The occupants return home, forcing them to hide. Three cannibalistic inbred mountain men, Three Finger, Saw Tooth, and One Eye, enter the cabin with Francine's corpse. The hiding group watches as they dismember and eat her. After the cannibals fall asleep, the group attempts to escape, but their captors awaken and chase them into the forest. The group finds previous victims' cars and tries to make up an escape plan. Chris gets shot in the leg while trying to distract the cannibals, and the girls take him to a truck, where they find Evan's body. Scott attempts another diversion for the other three to escape but gets killed with arrows. Jessie, Carly, and Chris stumble upon an old watchtower and call for help using an old radio. The cannibals arrive and are alerted when the radio responds to the group's call. Unable to get inside, the attackers set the tower on fire, forcing the three to jump out into the trees. In the ensuing chase, Carly is half-decapitated by Three Finger, while Jessie and Chris take refuge in a cave. In the morning, the cannibals find them, pushing Chris down the hill, then taking Jessie back to their cabin. Chris survives the fall and meets a police officer, who is promptly shot by Saw Tooth.

    "plot": "People on a tropical island have to evacuate when the island erupts in a coup or civil war. With the main airport under military control, the Americans converge on an airstrip where Rick Pearsall runs an air transport service with his DC-3. The plane flies through a violent storm and crashes into the ocean after it is struck by lightning. About half of the passengers manage to survive on one of the inflatable life rafts. Included are swimsuit model Laura, biology professor Diana, Diana's daughter Ariel, juvenile delinquent Brian, young Melissa, middle-aged Frank, bro Matt, embassy representative Karen, Marine guard Vic, and mysterious Ben Fields, who apparently has US government ties. After several days, Karen spots an island, which they paddle to. It seems like a tropical paradise, but mysteries and problems soon crop up. Ariel finds a human skull with a bullet hole in it, along with a Jeep on a dirt road. The party decides to follow the road to look for assistance. When Rick and Frank enter the water to beach the raft for the night, they are attacked by an unseen underwater creature, with squid-like tentacles and spines like a sea urchin. Diana unsuccessfully tries to neutralize the toxin. Overnight, Frank goes into the water and metamorphosizes into a reptilian sea monster with scales and webbed hands and feet. They follow the road, but Rick starts having psychic flashbacks of events on the island. They eventually find an American research station that was abandoned by its staff in 1976. Hacking the computer system, Ariel and Brian find that the station is named MK-Naomi, a name Ben is secretly familiar with. Rick leaves one night after more flashbacks. Laura, Ben, Matt, and Vic head out to search for him and soon encounter the island's indigenous tribe and are taken to their village. They spend the night, but Vic has a terrifying hallucination while trying to make out with a native woman and they quickly leave. Diana deduces that the station was involved in research for a wide range of biological weapons, including extrasensory perception, as in Rick's case. Rick returns after visiting the village and finding a hut with research materials from a scientist with a conscience, who had sabotaged the station and taken an antigen with him. Frank follows a trail the party had left for him to the research station. He breaks through the front door and terrifies the party. They fend him off using a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher. The search party returns from the village, whereupon they debate what to do about Frank. They decide to try to use the antigen elixir from the hut to cure Frank. Rick lures Frank into a walk-in freezer and injects him with the elixir. Frank mostly reverts to human form but dies moments later. Rick is given the remainder of the elixir and improves, but he retains his extrasensory abilities, deducing from a brief touch that Laura is a model (which she's ashamed of being) and that Ben has been to the island before.",

    "plot": "Five years after the events of the first film, Jonas Taylor has been involved in fighting environmental crimes while helping Mana One explore the Mariana Trench, where the Megalodon had been found. Following the death of Jonas' wife Suyin Zhang, he has been raising her teenage daughter Meiying alongside her uncle, Suyin's brother, Jiuming Zhang, who acquired his father's company and merged it with his own with financial backing from wealthy industrialist Hillary Driscoll. Mana One has been studying an 80 ft (24 m) female Meg called Haiqi who was discovered as a pup and trained by Jiuming in a reserve in Hainan. Jonas and Jiuming lead a routine submersible exploration to the Trench. Fellow Meg survivors DJ and Mac observe them from the Mana One. On the way down, the subs are pursued by Haiqi, who escaped captivity the previous night. The subs dive through the thermocline in an attempt to escape but Haiqi forces her way through it anyway. On the other side, the Mana One crews encounter two much larger Megs, a massive alpha male and a beta male, who mate with Haiqi. Jiuming realizes that Haiqi had been acting strange because it is mating season; she was calling the other Megs to mate. Venturing further down, the team stumbles across an illegal oceanic mining operation captained by mercenary Montes, who has a vendetta against Jonas for his imprisonment some time before. Montes' crew was hired by the secretly corrupt Driscoll to use the Mana One's access to the Trench to mine rare-earth minerals that could earn them billions. Montes kills his crew in an explosion to cover up their activities, which causes a rupture in the Trench and grounds the team's ships. DJ, Mac, and Mana One analyst Jess discover that the rescue pod has been sabotaged, forcing the crew to use exosuits to walk toward Montes' station, with only four of them surviving the journey. Jess reveals herself as a traitor and attempts to remotely kill the four, but they escape in a submersible. As the crew surfaces, they discover that the rupture from earlier has caused several Trench creatures, including the three Megs, lizard-like creatures known as Snappers and a giant octopus to escape to the surface. Jess is devoured by a Meg when it bites through a window thought to be \"Meg-proof.\" Jonas’ team escapes to a nearby resort, Fun Island. Driscoll, Montes, and the mercenaries arrive at Fun Island to kill Jonas' crew, but are attacked by the Snappers, who devour Driscoll. Jonas' group splits to evacuate the tourists as the Megs and the octopus attack. Jonas kills the beta Meg before being attacked by Montes. He knocks Montes into the mouth of the alpha Meg to be eaten. Jiuming creates a bomb out of fertilizer and takes over Driscoll's helicopter with Mac. The octopus takes down the helicopter and Jiuming injures it with his bomb, attracting Haiqi, who kills the octopus. Jonas uses one of the helicopter's rotors to fatally impale the alpha Meg. Haiqi heads towards Jonas, Jiuming, and Mac, but Jiuming uses his training signals to redirect her to a pod of dolphins. As the group settles on the beach and celebrates their survival, Rigas mentions the possibility that Haiqi is pregnant.",

    "plot": "On the night before a job interview, Tess Marshall arrives at an Airbnb-rented house in the Detroit neighborhood of Brightmoor. However, she finds it has been double-booked and is already occupied by a man named Keith. Initially unnerved by the situation, Tess warms to Keith and decides to stay the night while he sleeps on the couch. When she awakens during the night, she is shaken to find her bedroom door open, but Keith is asleep and assures her he did not open the door. Tess goes for her interview the next morning and is cautioned to stay on guard while in the neighborhood around the house, which is suffering from heavy urban decay. Returning to the house, she hurries inside when a stranger runs toward her, urging her to leave. She accidentally locks herself in the basement and stumbles across a hidden corridor, leading to a room with a camera, a stained mattress, a bucket, and a bloody hand print. Keith returns to the house and frees Tess from the basement. Ignoring Tess's warning, he investigates the hidden corridor. When he does not return, Tess follows and finds another hidden door and a deeper subterranean tunnel, where she finds Keith injured. While they argue about where to go, Keith is suddenly attacked and killed by a naked, deformed woman (The Mother), who bashes his skull against a wall. The house's owner, an actor named AJ, is fired from a television series over allegations that he raped his co-star. Pressured to sell assets to pay his legal costs, AJ travels to Detroit to inspect the house before selling it. He finds the hidden tunnel and tries to measure it, believing it may increase the house's value. The Mother attacks AJ in the tunnel, and he falls into a pit where he meets Tess. A flashback to 1982 shows Frank, the house's original owner, buying supplies for a home birth, before stalking a woman by gaining access to her home, with the implication that he is going to abduct and murder her. In the present, Tess and AJ are locked in the pit. Tess tells AJ that The Mother wants them to act as her children. AJ is dragged away by The Mother, who forcibly tries to breastfeed him. Tess uses the opportunity to escape the house with the help of the homeless Andre, the stranger from before, who warns her that The Mother will come after her at nightfall. With The Mother distracted by Tess's escape, AJ finds a room which The Mother refuses to approach. Inside, he encounters a bedridden Frank and assumes him to be another victim of The Mother. AJ assures Frank that he will call the police, before finding evidence that Frank had abducted and raped dozens of women. Horrified, AJ berates Frank before Frank kills himself with a concealed revolver. Tess leads police to the house, but they dismiss her story due to lack of evidence, assuming from her disheveled appearance and lack of identification that she is a delusional drug-addicted squatter, and leave as night falls. Tess breaks back into the house, retrieves her car keys, and drives into The Mother when she leaves the house, seemingly killing her. Tess returns to the basement to rescue AJ, but he mistakenly shoots her with Frank's revolver. AJ helps Tess escape, finding that The Mother's body has vanished, and they take shelter with Andre. Andre explains that The Mother is a product of Frank's multi-generational incest with the daughters he had by his victims. The Mother bursts in, violently kills Andre and pursues Tess and AJ up a water tower. AJ loses his gun and pushes Tess off the water tower to save himself. The Mother jumps after her and shields her from the fall. AJ finds Tess is still alive, but as he tries to rationalize his actions to Tess, The Mother awakens and gouges his eyes out before splitting his head open. The Mother attempts to comfort Tess, who remorsefully shoots The Mother dead with Frank's gun and limps away as the sun rises.",

    "plot": "In 1979, police officers arrive on a lonely farm in rural Texas and find numerous dead bodies wrapped in bags. They then enter the farmhouse and find something shocking in the basement. Twenty-four hours earlier, aspiring adult film star Maxine is on a trip to shoot a pornographic film with her producer fiancé Wayne, fellow burlesque dancer Bobby-Lynne and her Marine Corps veteran boyfriend Jackson, director RJ, and RJ's timid girlfriend Lorraine. The group arrives at a farm owned by World War veteran Howard and his wife Pearl, an elderly couple who have a guesthouse they rented for the shoot. Howard expresses his disdain to the group, but Wayne excuses this due to not informing Howard of their intentions. While Bobby-Lynne and Jackson act out a scene, Pearl discreetly observes Maxine nude swimming in a nearby lake, before inviting her into the farmhouse. Pearl expresses an unusual fixation on her, as Maxine looks similar to Pearl in her youth. Howard returns home and Pearl rushes Maxine out, urging her to keep it a secret. Maxine returns to the guesthouse and shoots a sex scene with Jackson in the barn, as Pearl secretly watches and imagines herself in Maxine's spot. Later, Pearl attempts to seduce Howard but he turns her down, citing heart problems. That night, Lorraine participates in the shoot, upsetting RJ. When everyone is asleep, an angry RJ attempts to drive away and strand the group at the farm, but finds Pearl in the driveway. After he rebuffs her advances, Pearl stabs him repeatedly in the neck, decapitating him. Noticing RJ's absence, Lorraine and Wayne search for him. In the barn, Wayne steps on a large nail and is stabbed in the eyes by Pearl with a pitchfork. Meanwhile, Howard lures Lorraine into their house, claiming Pearl has gone missing. He asks Lorraine to retrieve a flashlight from the basement. When she goes down, Howard locks the door and she discovers a naked male corpse hanging from the ceiling. Howard goes to the guesthouse and asks Jackson to help find Pearl. When they split up to scout the lake's perimeter, Jackson finds a car submerged in the water. After failing to draw Jackson into the water with his flashlight, Howard confronts him and shoots him in the chest. Meanwhile, Pearl sneaks into the guesthouse, undresses, and climbs into bed with Maxine, caressing her body, who awakens in horror to find Pearl lying next to her, her scream waking Bobby-Lynne. Back in the house, Lorraine breaks through the basement door with a hatchet but Howard breaks her fingers. Bobby-Lynne finds Pearl standing on the lake's edge and tries to help her. Pearl insults Bobby-Lynne and pushes her into the water where an alligator kills her. Pearl and Howard reunite and enter the guesthouse where they have sex. Maxine escapes to the van and arms herself with a pistol. She frees Lorraine, who runs out the front door, only to be shot by Howard. As the couple moves her body inside the house, Lorraine's corpse twitches, startling Howard and causing him to have a fatal heart attack. Maxine retrieves the keys to Howard's truck and attempts to shoot Pearl, but finds the pistol is empty. Pearl shoots at Maxine with Howard's gun, but the recoil knocks her back onto the porch, breaking her hip. As Maxine gets into Howard's truck, Pearl berates and insults her. Maxine reverses the truck, crushing Pearl's head before driving away. It is revealed that Maxine is the daughter of a televangelist frequently heard throughout the film. The police discover RJ's camera, with the sheriff speculating that it contains footage of \"one goddamn fucked-up horror picture.\"",

    "plot": "Marion Crane, a real estate secretary in Phoenix, steals $40,000 in cash from her employer after hearing her boyfriend, Sam Loomis, complain that his debts are delaying their marriage. She sets off to drive to Sam's home in the town of Fairvale, California, switching cars in Bakersfield after an encounter with a suspicious policeman. A heavy rainstorm forces Marion to stop at the secluded Bates Motel just a few miles from Fairvale. Norman Bates, the proprietor, whose Second Empire style house overlooks the motel, registers Marion (who uses an alias) and invites her to dinner with him in the motel's office. When Norman returns to his house to retrieve the food, Marion overhears him arguing with his mother about his desire to dine with Marion. After he returns, he discusses his hobby as a taxidermist, his mother's \"illness\" and how people have a \"private trap\" they want to escape. When Marion suggests that Norman should have his mother institutionalized, he becomes greatly offended and insists that she's harmless. Marion decides to drive back to Phoenix in the morning to return the stolen money. As she showers, a shadowy figure enters the bathroom with a kitchen knife and stabs her to death. Shortly afterward, Norman is heard horrified at his mother's actions and rushes back to find Marion dead. He hurriedly cleans up the murder scene and places Marion's body, her belongings, and, unbeknownst to him, the hidden cash in her car, before sinking the vehicle in a swamp. Marion's sister, Lila, arrives in Fairvale a week later, tells Sam about the theft and demands information about Marion's whereabouts. He denies knowing anything about Marion's disappearance. A private investigator named Arbogast approaches them, stating that he has been hired to retrieve the money. He stops in at the Bates Motel and questions Norman, whose nervous conduct, stuttering, and inconsistent answers arouse his suspicion. Arbogast examines the guest register and discovers from some handwriting in it that Marion spent a night in the motel. When Arbogast infers from things Norman says that Marion had spoken to his mother, Arbogast asks to speak to her, but Norman refuses to allow it. Arborgast leaves, finds a pay phone, and calls Lila to tell her of his suspicions and that he go back to the motel to speak to Norman's mother and that he'll rejoin Lila in town later. When Arbogast returns and enters the Bates's house to search for Norman's mother, a shadowy figure at the top of the stairs ambushes him and slashes him around the head. He tumbles down the stairs as the figure stabs him repeatedly. When Sam and Lila do not hear back from Arbogast, Sam goes to the motel to look for him. Sam spots a silhouette in the house who he assumes is Norman's mother, who is unresponsive to Sam's calls. Lila and Sam alert the local sheriff, Al Chambers, who tells them Norman's mother died in a murder–suicide by strychnine poisoning ten years before. Chambers suggests that Arbogast lied to Sam and Lila so he could pursue Marion and the money. Convinced that something happened to Arbogast, Lila and Sam drive to the motel and check in. Sam distracts Norman in the office while Lila sneaks into the Bates's house. Suspicious, Norman knocks Sam out. As Norman heads to the house, Lila hides in the fruit cellar, where she discovers the mummified body of Norman's mother. Lila screams in horror, and Norman, wearing women's clothes and a wig, enters the cellar and attempts to attack her but Sam, who had recovered, subdues Norman. At the police station, a psychiatrist explains to Lila, Sam and Chambers that Norman killed his mother and her lover out of jealousy. Unable to bear the guilt, he stole his mother's corpse and treated it as if she were still alive, then re-created his mother as an alternate personality, as jealous and possessive toward Norman as he felt about his mother. Whenever Norman was attracted to a woman, \"Mother\" would take over. Under the \"Mother\" personality, Norman killed two women before he killed Marion and Arbogast. The psychiatrist concludes that \"Mother\" has now completely submerged Norman's personality. Norman sits in a jail cell and hears his mother's voice stating the murders were his doing. Meanwhile, Marion's car, which contains her remains and the stolen money, is pulled from the swamp.",

    "plot": "Sam, a pessimistic, terminally ill cancer patient, lives at a hospice outside New York City with her cat, Frodo. Reuben, a nurse, convinces a reluctant Sam to join a group outing to a marionette show in Manhattan. While in the city, the group notices meteor-like objects falling from the sky. Shortly afterwards, alien creatures attack the gathered crowd and passersby. One creature hits a noisy ambulance, and the explosion knocks Sam unconscious. Sam later wakes up inside the puppet theater with Frodo, Reuben, and other survivors, including Henri, who signals her to remain quiet. Announcements from US military helicopters warn civilians to stay silent and hidden until the authorities can rescue them. Sam then witnesses fighter jets bombing and destroying the bridges leading out of Manhattan, preventing the creatures from leaving the island. One of the survivors begins to panic, and Henri accidentally kills him in the process of trying to keep him silent. The power grid cuts out that night, causing the building's emergency generator to noisily activate. Reuben turns it off, but attracts one creature that kills him on hearing his shirt rip. A distraught Sam takes Frodo and leaves for Harlem. The military announces it is preparing to evacuate civilians by boat from the South Street Seaport as the creatures are unable to swim. Groups of people start leaving buildings towards the evacuation point, but the volume of their crowded movement alerts the creatures, who attack them and cause a stampede. Sam flees in the opposite direction and is separated from Frodo. Eric, an English law student, escapes a flooded subway station and encounters Frodo, following him back to Sam. She attempts to convince Eric to go south to the evacuation point, but Eric, in shock, follows Sam back to her apartment instead. While there, Eric learns Sam used to write poetry. The next morning, Sam leaves alone for Harlem, but Eric finds her and they continue their journey together. Sam accidentally alerts the creatures, and they flee into a flooded subway. With no other way out, the pair is forced to wade through the deep waters, eventually waking a dormant creature that pursues them but drowns while they escape. The pair ends up in a ruined church, and while Sam rests, Eric ventures out alone to get pain medication for her from a pharmacy. He then rescues Frodo from a construction site, discovering a group of creatures led by a larger one feeding on the remains of an organic egg-like pod. Sam tells Eric that, as a child, she used to watch her late father play jazz at a club in Harlem, and would get pizza with him at Patsy's afterward, something Sam always wanted to do again before she died. Eric fulfills Sam's wish by taking her to the club, collecting pizza from another store, and performing a magic card trick to cheer her up. Eric and Sam see a boat in the river, filled with survivors escaping Manhattan. As the two leave together, creatures start to congregate along the shore. Sam gives Eric her sweater and Frodo, and then runs off to distract the creatures by smashing car windows. As a result, car alarms activate which attract the creatures away from the coastline. Although the creatures nearly catch them after Eric accidentally kicks a soda can, he and Frodo escape by jumping into the water and are pulled up into the boat by Henri. Eric then finds a note in the jacket written by Sam, telling him to take care of Frodo and thanking him for reminding her to live. As she walks into a deserted street, Sam listens to Nina Simone's \"Feeling Good\" on her iPod docked into a music player she found. Accepting her death, she smiles as she unplugs her earphones from the player and lets the music blare, causing a creature to suddenly appear behind her as the screen cuts to black.",

The next day, Lewis is killed when a weight machine crushes his head at the school gym. As they attempt to save Ian and Erin, who are working at a hardware store, Wendy manages to save Ian from falling stakes, but Death then skips to Erin, who falls on a nail gun, which shoots nails into her head. While identifying the next two survivors from the photographs, Wendy realizes they are her sister Julie and one of her friends, prompting Wendy and Kevin to rush to the local tricentennial fair to save them. Kevin saves Julie from being impaled on a harrow, but when Wendy tries to question her sister about the next person in line to die, an airborne flagpole fatally impales Julie's friend Perry Malinowski. After Wendy saves Kevin from an exploding propane canister, the trio is confronted by a grief-stricken Ian, who blames Wendy for Erin's death. An unstable cart of fireworks blasts in Wendy's direction, which she, Kevin, and Julie barely evade. It later hits a cherry picker, causing it to collapse on Ian, bisecting him. Five months later, Wendy experiences more omens while riding a subway train with her roommate Laura and her friend Sean. As Wendy is about to disembark, she suddenly reunites with Julie and Kevin, who had also boarded the train. Wendy receives another premonition that the train will crash, killing everyone on board. Panicked, the remaining survivors attempt to stop the train as it crashes off-screen.",

    "title": "The Gorge",
    "plot": "Two elite snipers receive identical missions: guard opposite sides of a remote, top-secret gorge for a year without contact with their counterparts or the outside world. Levi Kane, a former U.S. Marine Scout/Sniper, is recruited by a mysterious woman named Bartholomew to guard the west tower. Drasa, a Lithuanian covert operative frequently employed by the Kremlin, guards the east tower. Levi suffers from PTSD-induced nightmares, while Drasa's terminally ill father Erikas plans to die by suicide on Valentine's Day. Levi relieves his predecessor J.D., a former British Royal Marine corporal, who explains that the location is kept hidden by powerful cloaking antennas and the towers are armed to contain monstrous creatures within the gorge, nicknamed \"The Hollow Men\". J.D. warns of \"Straydog\", an unknown emergency protocol, and that battalions of soldiers sent into the gorge in the late 1940s never returned. Believing he is being exfiltrated after leaving the gorge, J.D. is instead killed on Bartholomew's orders after being picked up by helicopter. After several uneventful months, Drasa violates the no-communication protocol on her birthday, engaging Levi in conversation via written signs and a sharpshooting competition. A wave of Hollow Men attempt to climb out of the gorge, but Drasa and Levi use their rifles, automated turrets, and mines to defend their towers and each other. As time goes on, they bond from afar. Six months into their posting, Levi ziplines across the gorge to have dinner with Drasa. They spend a romantic night together, and he reveals he is writing a poem for her. The next morning, as Levi returns to his tower, his cable snaps when mines are detonated by Hollow Men, forcing him to parachute into the gorge. Arming herself, Drasa parachutes after him. The pair discover that all plant and animal life within the gorge has been cross-mutated, including the Hollow Men, revealed to be the missing soldiers from decades past. Fighting off the hostile lifeforms, Drasa and Levi find the source of the mutations: a World War II bioweapons research lab abandoned after an earthquake caused a contaminant leak that produces symptoms within five days. The facility has since been maintained by Darklake, a private defense corporation extracting hybrid samples in hopes of creating super soldiers. Drasa and Levi discover Straydog is the original fail-safe protocol to sterilize the site with a nuclear explosion. They find a working Jeep with a towing winch, using it to climb out of the gorge as they fight off the Hollow Men, and agree to separate for five days to ensure they are not infected with the mutagens. During Levi's monthly radio check-in, Bartholomew admits that she works for Darklake and orders him to kill Drasa. Aware that the two snipers have discovered the truth, Bartholomew dispatches a team to eliminate them. Bartholomew and her men arrive to find the towers abandoned. Drasa and Levi outgun the armed drones sent after them and destroy the cloaking antennas, exposing the site to surveillance and triggering Straydog's detonation. Bartholomew and her men are killed in the blast, and the area is destroyed, while Drasa is separated from Levi and completes her five-day self-quarantine. She reaches France to rendezvous with Levi, who does not appear, and discovers that he left her the completed poem in an envelope marked \"If I don't make it, open at sunset.\" Some time later, Drasa has begun a new life as a waitress in a local restaurant. She is surprised by Levi, who says he was delayed by an injury, and they embrace and kiss.",

    "plot": "German auditor Lilli Funke travels to Mallorca to visit her younger sister Valeria \"Valle\". There, she soon learns she is engaged to Frenchman Manu Chassée, whom she met four and a half months earlier, and they are planning to open a bed and breakfast (B&B) together. In a nightclub, Lilli meets bartender and club manager Tom Sommer, also from Germany. The two begin an affair. Valle and Manu want to buy his uncle's property for the B&B. She has €40,000 for this from her mother's inheritance, money originally intended for her university education. Valle also wants to sell the property she inherited from her mother, half of which is owned by her sister, who opposes the sale. Soon afterwards, Lilli meets real estate investor Nick Unterwalt, who offers €900,000 for the property. Lilli's mother was from Mallorca and died when Lilli was 18, while Valle was 10. Manu's ex-girlfriend Bea suddenly shows up. Lilli discovers that Manu does not work at the Hotel Mirabelle as claimed and fears he is just trying to exploit Valle. He claims to have been made redundant when the hotel changed ownership. Tom arranges for an appraiser, who estimates the value of the property at €700,000. He advises Lilli to accept Unterwalt's offer, and she agrees. When she has a broken water pipe repaired at the house, the repairman tells her it had been tampered with. Lilli then visits Bea to hear her side of the story. Bea reveals that Manu has scammed her out of a lot of money and is now trying the same trick on Valeria. Lilli confronts her sister with the fact that Manu is a fraud, but Valle refuses to believe her. Manu expresses his joy to Tom that the sisters have agreed to the sale to their mutual client, Unterwalt, and that he will soon be rid of Valeria. Through Unterwalt's employee, Lilli inadverently discovers the property meant for the B&B does not actually belong to his uncle and is not for sale. Furthermore, a luxury resort is planned for construction on their property, and all investors are already on board. Lilli shows up at Unterwalt's eight-year-old daughter's birthday party at his estate, where she encounters Manu, Valle, Tom, and the \"appraiser\". Realising it has all been a scam, Lilli confronts Unterwalt with the fact that the property is worth far more than the €900,000 being offered. In Tom's belongings, Lilli finds an envelope addressed to his real name, Tobias Winter. On his laptop, she also finds a folder marked \"LF\", containing documents and photos of Lilli and Valeria. When confronted with this, Tom asserts that not everything was a lie. As Valle begins to have doubts about Manu, she visits Bea and finds her dead in a bathtub. The police suspect suicide. Meanwhile, Tom confesses to Lilli that he was responsible for the burst water pipe. He also orchestrated the theft of her handbag at the nightclub. After Unterwalt puts pressure on his wife Girasol, she tries to force Lilli to sign the purchase agreement, while Manu threatens her with a gun. (It is apparent that Girasol is controlling the two male expats.) Tom surprises everyone by disarming him and jumps off a cliff into the sea with Lilli. The police, called by Tom, arrest Manu and Girasol. A year later, Lilli returns to Mallorca, where Valle has since opened a B&B, and Lilli reunites with Tom.",

    "plot": "In 2004, the elderly Duke reads a romantic story from a notebook to a female patient of a nursing home. In 1940, at a carnival in Seabrook Island, South Carolina, lumber mill worker Noah Calhoun sees 17-year-old heiress Allison \"Allie\" Hamilton, there for the summer. He pursues her, woos her into dating him after an evening out, and they begin a romance. Near the end of the summer, Noah discovers that Allie will be attending Sarah Lawrence College in New York in the fall, far from Seabrook. He takes her to the Windsor Plantation, telling her about his dream to repair the abandoned building. They prepare to have sex, but are interrupted by mutual friend Fin, who tells them that Allie's parents have called the police to look for her. When Allie and Noah return to her parents' mansion, Allie's mother Anne makes it clear she is against the relationship and forbids her from seeing him. Having overheard the conversation, Noah admits that he does not see a future for them. A distraught Allie breaks up with him, but immediately regrets the decision. The next morning, Anne announces they will be returning to Charleston immediately, one week earlier than planned. Allie rushes to the lumber mill to apologize to Noah, but he is away; she asks Fin to tell him she loves him. Noah rushes to Allie's home when the message is delivered, but is too late. Noah writes Allie every day for a year, but Allie's mother intercepts and hides the letters. When World War II erupts, Noah and Fin enlist and fight in the Battle of the Bulge, where Fin is killed. Meanwhile, Allie nurses wounded soldiers in a hospital, meeting wounded Captain Lon Hammond Jr., a young lawyer who comes from old Southern money. After a few years, they become engaged, to Allie's parents' delight. When Noah returns from the war, he finds his father has sold their home so Noah can buy the Windsor Plantation. Soon after, his father dies, and Noah begins repairing the house. Later, as Allie tries on her wedding dress, she sees a newspaper photo of Noah in front of the successfully renovated house and faints. Allie's feelings for Noah resurface, so she travels to Seabrook alone before the wedding. There, she finds Noah living at the Windsor Plantation. After rowing in the rain, Noah tells Allie about the letters he sent her, and she realizes her mother kept them from her. They rekindle their relationship and have sex. Days later, Anne arrives to warn Allie that Lon has come to Seabrook. She reveals that she once also loved a lower-class man in town and wonders what their lives would have been like had she chosen differently. She gives Noah's letters to Allie, which she has kept, and suggests she choose wisely. Upon returning to the house, Allie argues with Noah, and he tells her to choose based on what she wants. She drives back to her hotel, sobbing and confused after having read the letters, and confesses her infidelity to Lon. He still wants to marry her, but she follows her heart and returns to Noah. Back in 2004, the elderly woman is revealed to be Allie, now suffering from dementia. Duke is actually Noah, who uses a pseudonym to not startle her in her disoriented state. The book he reads to her is her journal, detailing their romance and life together so he could help her remember him. Noah has kept his promise to read it to her daily. Near the end of the journal, Allie recognizes Noah and they embrace. They dance to their song, \"I'll Be Seeing You\", and she asks about their children. However, Allie's dementia quickly returns and she panics at seeing a stranger touching her, so is sedated. Later, Duke has a heart attack and is treated in the nursing home while Allie is taken to the dementia ward. Upon his recovery, Noah sneaks into Allie's room in the night while the nurse turns a blind eye. Allie instantly recognizes him and they kiss.

    "plot": "Lucy is a university student who works in an office in the daytime and at a restaurant in the evenings. She is occasionally a research subject at a science laboratory. Lucy is paying tuition and rent by doing several jobs. Her sister's boyfriend is continually on her about her part of the rent. She is caring for Birdmann, who is an alcoholic and is very attracted to her. While she does not return his sexual interest, Lucy enjoys Birdmann's company, and in his presence is the only time she is shown smiling or laughing. An old joke between the two is that Birdmann frequently asks Lucy to marry him; Lucy always says no. Due to lack of money and Birdmann's addiction, Lucy makes a decision to look for another part-time job. In response to a classified ad for yet another short-term job, Lucy meets Clara, who runs a service that combines lingerie modelling and catering performed by young women at a black tie dinner party for mostly male clients. Clara assures her that the men are not allowed to touch the women sexually, and Lucy agrees to try it. Clara inspects Lucy's body and names her \"Sara\" for the purpose of anonymity. At the dinner party, Lucy is the only girl dressed in white; the other women wear black lingerie that is much more revealing than Lucy's outfit. After one other session as a serving girl, Lucy gets promoted. She receives a call from Clara's assistant for a different request. Lucy is driven to a country mansion, where Clara offers Lucy a new role wherein she will be voluntarily sedated and sleep naked while male clients lie beside her. They are permitted to caress and cuddle her, but vaginal penetration is not allowed. After Lucy falls asleep, she lies unconscious on the bed and Clara leads in her client. After Clara reminds the man of the no-penetration rule, he strips and curls up beside Lucy. After a few of these sessions, Lucy has enough money to move into a larger, more expensive apartment, where she lives alone. She receives a call from Birdmann, who has overdosed on painkillers. She goes to his house and finds him dying in his bed. Upon a dying man's last request, sobbing, she takes off her shirt and gets in bed with him, but he dies in her arms. At Birdmann's funeral, Lucy abruptly asks an old boyfriend if he will marry her, in an echo of Birdmann's old playful banter. The ex-boyfriend, however, not understanding the reference, takes her seriously and, shocked, refuses her, citing a number of Lucy's personal problems as his reasons. At her next assignment with Clara, Lucy asks if she can see what happens during the sessions while she is asleep. Clara refuses, saying it will put her clients at risk of blackmail. Lucy decides to surreptitiously film her next encounter. The client is once again the first man, but this time, he also drinks the tea with a much larger dose of the sleeping drug. The following morning, Clara comes in and checks the man's pulse, showing no surprise when he cannot be awakened. Clara tries to wake Lucy, who has overdosed as well, and is eventually able to revive her using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Lucy begins screaming when she sees the dead man in bed next to her. The film ends with the scene captured by the hidden camera: the dead old man and the sleeping girl both lying peacefully together in bed.",

    "plot": "In 1938 in Salzburg, at the end of the Federal State of Austria regime, Maria is a free-spirited young Austrian woman studying to become a nun at Nonnberg Abbey. However, her youthful enthusiasm and lack of discipline cause some concern. Mother Abbess sends Maria to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp to be the new governess to his seven children: Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta, and Gretl. The Captain has been raising his children using strict military discipline following their mother's death; they have scared away several governesses by playing tricks. Although the children misbehave at first, Maria responds with kindness and patience, and soon the children come to trust and respect her. While the Captain is away in Vienna, Maria makes playclothes for the children out of drapes that are to be changed. She takes them around Salzburg and the mountains while teaching them how to sing. When the Captain returns to the villa with Baroness Elsa Schraeder, a wealthy socialite, and their mutual friend Max Detweiler, they are greeted by Maria and the children returning from a boat ride on the lake, which ends abruptly when their boat overturns. Displeased by his children's clothes and activities along with Maria's impassioned appeal that he get closer to his children, the Captain attempts to fire Maria. However, he hears singing from inside the house and is astonished to see his children singing for the Baroness. Filled with emotion, the Captain joins his children, singing for the first time in years. The Captain apologizes to Maria and asks her to stay. Impressed by the children's singing, Max proposes that he enter them in the upcoming Salzburg Festival, but the Captain disapproves of letting his children sing in public. During a grand party at the villa, where guests in formal attire waltz in the ballroom, Maria and the children look on from the garden terrace. When the Captain notices Maria teaching Kurt the traditional Ländler folk dance, he steps in and partners Maria in a graceful performance, culminating in a close embrace. Confused about her feelings, Maria blushes and breaks away. Later, the Baroness, who noticed the Captain's attraction to Maria, hides her jealousy by indirectly convincing Maria that she must return to the abbey. Mother Abbess learns that Maria has stayed in seclusion to avoid her growing romantic feelings for the Captain, so she encourages her to return to the villa to look for her purpose in life. When Maria returns to the villa, she learns about the Captain's engagement to the Baroness and agrees to stay until they find a replacement governess. However, the Baroness learns that the Captain's feelings for Maria have not changed, so she peacefully calls off the engagement and returns to Vienna while encouraging the Captain to express his feelings for Maria, who marries him. While the couple is on their honeymoon, Max enters the children into the Salzburg Festival against their father's wishes. Having learned that Austria has been annexed by the Third Reich, the couple return to their home, where the Captain receives a telegram, ordering him to report to the German Naval base at Bremerhaven to accept a commission in the Kriegsmarine. Strongly opposed to the Nazis and their ideology, the Captain tells his family they must leave Austria immediately. That night, the Trapp family attempt to flee to Switzerland, but they are stopped by a group of Brownshirts, led by the Gauleiter Hans Zeller, waiting outside the villa. To cover his family's tracks, the Captain maintains they are headed to the Salzburg Festival to perform. Zeller insists on escorting them to the festival, after which his men will accompany the Captain to Bremerhaven. Later that night at the festival, during their final number, the Trapp family slips away and seeks shelter at the abbey, where Mother Abbess hides them in the cemetery crypt. Zeller and his men soon arrive and search the abbey, but the family is able to escape using the caretaker's car. When Zeller's men attempt to pursue, they discover their cars will not start since two of the nuns have sabotaged their engines. The next morning—after driving to the Swiss border—the Trapp family makes its way on foot across the frontier into Switzerland to safety and freedom.",

    "plot": "In 1793, amid the French Revolution, young army officer Napoleon Bonaparte watches Marie Antoinette beheaded by the guillotine. Later that year, Revolutionary leader Paul Barras has Napoleon manage the Siege of Toulon; he storms the city and repels the British ships with artillery. After Maximilien Robespierre is deposed and executed at the end of the Reign of Terror, French leaders, including Napoleon, attempt to restore stability. Again employing artillery, Napoleon suppresses the royalist insurrection on 13 Vendémiaire in 1795. Napoleon woos aristocratic widow Joséphine de Beauharnais and the two eventually marry. Despite their vigorous sex life, they bear no children. In Egypt, he prevails again at the Battle of the Pyramids in 1798, but rushes home when he hears Joséphine has an almost 10-year younger lover, Hippolyte Charles. The Directory criticises him for abandoning his troops, but he condemns them for their poor leadership of France and with several collaborators such as Talleyrand, Fouché, Sieyès and Ducos, overthrows them in the Coup of 18 Brumaire and becomes First Consul. Napoleon is crowned Emperor of the French by the pope in 1804, during which he audaciously puts the crown on his own head. Foreign Minister Talleyrand suggests to Austria an alliance, though the Austrians dismiss the idea. A year later, Napoleon outmanoeuvres and defeats the Austrians and the Russians at the Battle of Austerlitz, forcing them to retreat over frozen lakes before bombarding the ice and drowning them. Afterwards, he invites Austrian Emperor Francis II for wine—which Russian Tsar Alexander I declines to attend—and tells Francis that since he did not totally destroy their armies, he expects the latter to be grateful. Napoleon's mother has him impregnate a mistress, proving that Joséphine is infertile. He divorces her in 1810, publicly slapping her in the face when she initially refuses to read her portion of the decree, but the two remain on good terms and continue exchanging friendly letters. Napoleon marries Marie Louise of Austria, who bears a son one year later. In 1812, Napoleon invades Russia after Alexander reneges on the Treaties of Tilsit. He prevails, despite bloody guerrilla resistance by Don Cossacks, and then fighting the huge Battle of Borodino, but finds Moscow empty and later set aflame. Napoleon retreats during the winter to France, having lost about half a million men. In 1814, the Coalition forces Napoleon's abdication and exiles him to Elba. In 1815, upon hearing that Joséphine is unwell, Napoleon escapes the island and in the Hundred Days returns to power in France. She, having been forced into reclusion at the Château de Malmaison, dies before he arrives. King Louis XVIII sends the Fifth Regiment to stop Napoleon, but he charms them into joining him. At the Battle of Waterloo in June, Napoleon, having amassed more troops, confronts the British army under Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington. French cavalry charges are repulsed by British infantry squares, and a desperate Napoleon urges his remaining soldiers forward, but this advance is defeated by re-formed lines of enemy infantry. The forces of Prussian Marshal Blücher arrive to reinforce Wellesley, and the French are broken. As Napoleon retreats, he salutes Wellesley. Napoleon is exiled, this time to the island of Saint Helena in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, and is seen bantering with children, writing his memoirs that would become read all over the world and presenting to his listeners a version of history where he is always right. An unwell Napoleon collapses, hearing Joséphine beckon him to meet her again. Napoleon dies in 1821. An epilogue notes that roughly 3 million people died in his wars.",

Afraid to trust him, she soon runs away, but Michael again convinces her to return. As Angel and Michael begin their life on the farm, she develops feelings for him. They finally consummate their marriage. Paul, the husband of Michael's late sister Tess, arrives and immediately distrusts Angel. Angel runs away again when she realizes Michael wants children since believes she is sterile as Duke forced her to have an abortion years ago. Paul agrees to give Angel a ride but demands she pay for it with sex. Angel complies and becomes physically ill afterwards. Back in Pair-A-Dice, Angel returns to the brothel to get what Duchess owes her. However, the brothel was burned down by MacGowan with the Duchess inside. He was then killed by an angry mob. With no money nor place to live, Angel reluctantly prostitutes herself through a bar. She gratefully returns home when Michael arrives. Michael and Angel's relationship blossoms, based on honesty and affection. Angel finally falls in love with Michael and genuinely wants to stay with him. Michael and Angel help a woman who is in labor and end up taking in her whole family. Angel believes Miriam, the oldest daughter, would be a much better wife for Michael since they have a lot in common and she can give him children. Angel makes love to Michael one last time and then leaves the next day. Angel leaves Miriam her wedding ring and a note asking her to take care of Michael. Michael decides not to go after Angel since she has free will and needs to make the decision to come back on her own. Having learned to cook while with Michael, Angel gets a job at a cafe rather than returning to prostitution. However, the same day she starts working there, the hotel is burnt down. Angel later discovers the recently arrived Duke did it, upon hearing she was working there. Duke makes Angel return to prostitution to spare her boss's life. However, realizing he continues to recruit young girls into prostitution like her, Angel confronts him. Duke silences her with a death threat. Duke places Angel on the stage in his new establishment. There, with regained faith, she reveals to the audience Duke's sexual trafficking of young girls. Denying the allegations, he attempts to murder Angel, but an African-American man subdues him so she can free the captive girls. An outraged mob lynches Duke. Afterward, Angel dedicates herself to helping rehabilitate young girls. Three years later, Paul locates Angel, who is running a school for girls. Angel assumes that Michael has married Miriam, but Paul informs her that he is married to Miriam. Angel accuses Paul of coming between Michael and Miriam, but he insists Miriam never wanted to be with Michael and that Michael is still waiting for Angel. Paul tearfully apologizes for his mistreatment of her but Angel insists she has long forgiven him. Angel returns home to Michael. Angel finally tells him that her real name is Sarah and she has never told anyone that because it is the one thing she had that no one could take from her. After sharing a tender embrace, Michael welcomes her home and returns her wedding ring. Years later, we see Michael and a pregnant Angel fishing with their young son.",

    "plot": "Joel Barish discovers that his estranged girlfriend, Clementine Kruczynski, has undergone a procedure to have her memories of him erased by the suburban Long Island firm Lacuna. Heartbroken, he decides to undergo the same procedure. In preparation, he records a tape recounting his memories of their volatile relationship. The Lacuna employees work on Joel's brain as he sleeps in his apartment so that he will wake up with no memory of the procedure. One employee, Patrick, leaves to see Clementine; since her procedure, he has been using Clementine's memories of Joel as a guide to seduce her. While the procedure runs on Joel's brain, the technician, Stan, and the secretary, Mary, take drugs, party, and have sex. Joel re-experiences his memories of Clementine in reverse chronological order as they are erased, starting with their last fight. As he reaches earlier, happier memories, he realizes that he does not want to forget her. His mental projection of Clementine suggests that he hides her in memories that do not involve her. This halts the procedure, but Stan calls his boss, Howard, who arrives and restarts it. Joel comes to his last remaining memory of Clementine: the day they first met, on a beach in Montauk. As the memory crumbles around them, Clementine tells Joel to meet her in Montauk. In Joel's apartment, Mary tries to impress Howard through their mutual interest in poetry by reciting a verse from Eloisa to Abelard. While Stan is outside, she tells Howard she is in love with him and they kiss. Howard's wife arrives and sees them through the window. Enraged, she tells Howard to tell Mary the truth: Mary and Howard had previously had an affair, and Mary had her memories of it erased. Disgusted, Mary steals the Lacuna records and mails them to the patients, including Joel and Clementine. Joel wakes up on Valentine's Day with his memories of Clementine erased. He impulsively takes the Long Island Rail Road to Montauk and calls in sick to work. He accidentally meets Clementine on the train ride home; they are drawn to one another, and go on a date to the frozen Charles River in Boston. Joel drives Clementine home and Patrick sees the two of them, realizing they have found each other again. Joel and Clementine receive their Lacuna records from Mary and listen to their tapes together. They are shocked by the bitter memories they had of each other and almost separate again, but agree to try again.",

    "plot": "Alex Claremont-Diaz, the first son of the United States, attends the wedding of Prince Phillip, Duke of Cambridge. Alex has a long-standing feud with Prince Henry, Prince Phillip's younger brother. During the reception, Alex and Henry get into an argument that results in the £75,000 wedding cake falling on top of them. To mitigate the fallout and help his mother's re-election campaign, Alex and Henry are forced into a series of interviews and appearances, where they pose as friends. Alex later admits to Henry that he began to resent him after Henry rebuffed him at Alex's first appearance as a public figure. Henry apologizes, explaining he had just lost his father and was forced by the Palace to appear at public events while still mourning, and the two make amends, later beginning to text and become friends. Invited to Alex's annual New Year's party, Henry leaves abruptly after seeing Alex kiss several girls at midnight. Alex follows him outdoors to the White House grounds. Henry kisses Alex, but fails to respond to Alex's attempts to contact him over the following weeks. After confiding in Nora, his best friend and the Vice President's granddaughter, Alex realizes that he is attracted to Henry. Alex texts Henry to ask if he will be attending the Prime Minister's dinner, which Henry does not respond to. Henry eventually does come to the dinner and they share a kiss in a private room, which is interrupted by Alex's secret service. The pair become lovers, although they keep their involvement secret from everyone except close family and friends, and their Secret Service and MI5 bodyguards. Alex and Henry use private jets to traipse back and forth across the Atlantic throughout the film. When Alex comes up with a plan for his mother to win Texas in the upcoming election, he travels there to lead the campaign. When he goes to Brooklyn to speak at the Democratic National Convention, Henry unexpectedly visits him. Alex later comes out to his mother, who is supportive, but advises him to think about his relationship carefully. Alex invites Henry to his family's vacation home near Austin, Texas, and Alex begins to tell Henry that he is in love with him, but Henry, fearing that he cannot sustain a love-relationship – since the British royal family will not accept it – preemptively leaves the conversation and flees to England. He refuses to respond to Alex's attempts to contact him. Alex visits Henry in London unexpectedly and demands an explanation for his behavior. Henry admits that he loves Alex too, but explains that his royal position makes it impossible. Alex convinces Henry that their relationship is worth fighting for, and the two reconcile. Shortly after Alex returns to the U.S., Alex and Henry's personal e‑mails to each other are hacked and posted online by a political journalist who had a brief, drunken make-out session with Alex; the posted e-mails are widely read and reported in the press. In response, Alex makes a touching speech. The King orders all Alex's and Henry's means of contact cut off. Zahra Bankston, the White House Deputy Chief of Staff, gets in touch with Shaan, Henry's equerry, and Alex and Henry are finally able to talk. Alex immediately flies to London to reunite with Henry. King James III summons them to a meeting and tells them that they cannot be together, since their relationship is incompatible with royal tradition and the expectations of the public. However, Henry's supportive sister Beatrice notices a crowd gathered in front of Buckingham Palace in support of them, and she cites news reports of similar crowds all over the U.K. Alex and Henry kiss in front of the window, then step outside together onto the balcony and openly greet the cheering public as a couple. On election night, Henry returns to the United States to be with Alex, whose plan to win Texas for his mother ultimately results in her barely winning re-election. Later that evening, Alex and Henry are seen biking down the street toward Alex's \"working class\" childhood home in Austin, where they leave the bikes on the lawn and go inside to personally celebrate.",

    "plot": "The film immediately introduces the two main protagonists. Paris (Jessica Clark) is a young, dark-haired woman who works as a high-priced escort/call-girl, but is a creative artist by nature. Rebecca (Barbara Niven) is a rich, blonde, middle-aged wife. The initial voice-over also narrates a cancer affliction that has grown beyond hope. Rebecca has lived a wealthy yet unhappy existence in creating a seemingly perfect family with her husband Mason Westridge (John Heard). The signs of trouble are their hostility towards each other and conflicting opinions about whether Jessica, Rebecca's only daughter who has a different father, should receive equal stock shares of the family business as her two half-brothers. It is revealed that Mason had attempted to, and possibly succeeded in, sexually assaulting Jessica. Rebecca feels an emotional emptiness and confides in her two lesbian best friends that she has never had an orgasm, and that she and Mason only have sex once every six months, which is fine with her. One of her friends suggests that Rebecca try a very discreet escort service run by her own cousin (Morgan Fairchild). It is then that Rebecca meets Paris and through a series of very discreet meetings, Rebecca eventually warms up to Paris' gentle advances and achieves her goals of having sex with another woman, and experiencing true happiness and satisfaction. We learn that Paris, who is well appreciated for her services, seems to be in agony over a past mistake that had led her to this profession. It is implied that Paris' husband died after she accidentally pushed him into the road and he was hit by a car shortly after their wedding day. It is Rebecca who later helps Paris to let go of her past and heal. Meanwhile, one of the three Westridge children finds the medical report of inoperable cancer that Mason Westridge has been hiding in his office desk. They all confront Rebecca and ask whether she had known about it all along. The children assume that the report refers to their father, and Rebecca tells her children that and they are not to mention it. Rebecca contacts another escort, Paris' friend, and gives her an envelope of money to help Paris leave the escort world and pursue her artistic talents. She reveals that she is the one who has cancer, and that she is dying. Afterwards, Rebecca makes the courageous decision to say goodbye to Paris. Towards the end of the movie, Rebecca is seen as a butterfly, beautiful girl and such a kind human. Someone who has learned to spread her wings because of her relationship with Paris. In the final scene, Paris has her own art exhibition after Rebecca's funeral. Jessica approaches Paris and introduces herself, as the two lesbian best friends watch, and says, \"I want to learn about my mother at the end.\"",

    "title": "Downton Abbey: A New Era",
    "plot": "In 1928, Tom Branson, the Earl of Grantham's widowed son-in-law, marries Lucy Smith, the illegitimate daughter of and sole heir to Lady Maud Bagshaw, Queen Mary's lady-in-waiting. Violet Crawley, the Dowager Countess of Grantham, astonishes the family by revealing that long ago she was given a villa in Southern France by the Marquis de Montmirail, who has recently died. Violet is bequeathing it to her great-granddaughter, Sybbie, the daughter of Tom and the late Lady Sybil Crawley (Branson), to ensure that she is more socially and financially on par with her cousins George, Caroline, Marigold, and Peter. A film production company wants to use Downton to shoot a silent film called, The Gambler. Robert Crawley (Lord Grantham) declines, but eldest daughter and estate manager, Lady Mary Talbot, says the fee would replace Downton's leaking roof. The household staff are eager to see the film's stars, but lead actress Myrna Dalgliesh's haughtiness offends some of them. The new Marquis de Montmirail invites the Crawley family to visit the villa. The ailing Violet is unable to travel, but Tom and Lucy, Lady Bagshaw, Robert Crawley and wife Cora, their daughter Edith and her husband, Bertie Pelham, the Marquess of Hexham, accept. Former butler Carson, valet Mr Bates, and lady's maid Miss Baxter accompany the family. Lady Edith, once again writing for the London-based magazine she owns, uses the trip as a working assignment. Lady Mary remains at Downton to oversee the film crew, assisted by Mrs Carson, the former Mrs Hughes. The new Marquis de Montmirail welcomes the family, though his mother contests Violet Crawley's ownership. However, the family lawyer states that there is no basis for a claim. The Marquis later stuns Robert by implying that Robert's birth date, nine months after the Dowager Countess's 1864 visit, could mean they are half-brothers. That night, Cora tells Robert she may have a fatal illness. Robert breaks down at the prospect of losing his mother, the Crawley name and title, and his wife in short succession. At Downton, the studio cancels The Gambler because silent films are now unprofitable in the new \"talkie\" era. Lady Mary suggests salvaging the project by dubbing in the dialogue for completed scenes and filming new ones with sound. Lead actor Guy Dexter's resonant voice is suitable, but Myrna Dalgleish's marked cockney accent is inappropriate for her upper-class character. Mrs Hughes suggests that Lady Mary dub Dalgleish's voice. Recalling that she has found it difficult to get work as talkies become more prevalent, Dalgleish wants to walk away, but Downton servants Anna and Daisy persuade her to complete the film. Former Downton footman Mr Molesley, who can lip-read, reconstructs the dialogue for dubbing and creates a dialogued script. During production, Dexter tacitly reveals to Downton's closeted butler, Thomas Barrow, that he is also gay. Dexter offers Barrow the position of his housekeeper and wardrobe assistant in Hollywood, so that they can be together. The family returns to Downton while filming continues. Lady Mary gently rebuffs director Jack Barber's flirtations, although her husband Henry's prolonged absence for a car rally has strained their marriage. Dr Clarkson diagnoses Cora with pernicious anaemia, a treatable condition. Cora helps Dalgleish develop an American accent, potentially saving her career. Edith, unfulfilled and constrained as a marchioness, intends to resume running her London-based magazine. Wanting more privacy, newlywed servants Daisy and Andy successfully scheme to match Daisy's former father-in-law, Mr Mason, and Downton cook Mrs Patmore. When the unpaid movie extras walk out, the Downton staff replace them. Barber offers Molesley a lucrative deal as a screenwriter. Molesley then proposes to Baxter, unaware that everyone can overhear them on an open microphone. Violet assures Robert that the late Lord Grantham was his father and that nothing occurred between her and Montmirail. Violet's health deteriorates and she dies surrounded by family and servants. After Barrow resigns as butler to accept Dexter's offer, Mary asks Carson to train footman Andy as Barrow's replacement. Months later, Tom and Lucy, along with Sybbie, return to Downton with their newborn child. A new portrait of Violet hangs in the entry hall.",

    "plot": "During World War II, Olivia \"Livy\" Dunne, a Denver minister's daughter, is pregnant by a US Navy flight instructor on furlough. To cover up his daughter's unwed pregnancy, her father quietly compels the reluctant Livy to marry, arranging with another minister to find a suitable willing husband. Hearing of Livy's dilemma, Ray Singleton agrees to marry without having met her. Though young, personable, and a family man, Ray has little opportunity to find a wife in a remote southeastern Colorado farming region where young women are scarce. Ray lost both his parents prior to the war and his younger brother, Daniel, during the attack on Pearl Harbor. Having studied archeology in graduate school, Livy had aspirations to travel and is bored with farm talk around crops and the weather. A man of few words, Ray is a hard worker, kind, honest and patient, whose daily activity is focused on working his ancestral farm. Learning of her graduate treatise on Heinrich Schliemann, the eager-to-please Ray checks out a book on Schliemann from the local library. Livy finds native American arrowheads among Ray’s grandparents’ former belongings. Livy secretly writes several letters to Lieutenant Edward Brown, her baby's father, but receives no response. A visit by her sister further complicates matters. With her husband in the military, her lonely sister wants Livy to leave Ray, suggesting they make up stories of her husband’s drunken violent nature to justify the separation. Livy cannot do this, as Ray is a good man. As most young men are at war, Ray's farm is supplemented by Japanese Americans internees from nearby Camp Amache. Feeling isolated, Livy befriends two sisters from the camp, Florence and Rose Umahara, both college students before being interned, finding intellectual stimulation and comfort in their friendship. A letter finally arrives from Lt. Brown, which Ray picks up during a routine post office run. Upset that Livy has furtively contacted the lieutenant, Ray goes off for the evening to reflect. In the letter, Lt. Brown insists he couldn't be her baby’s father. Distraught, Livy confides in Ray’s married sister, Martha, a neighbor. Remaining unjudgmental, Martha affirms to Livy how much Ray loves her, but she advises Livy to leave quickly if determined to go. Believing she has decided to leave, Ray tells Livy he loves her and gives her his mother's wedding ring, saying that he knows she will be happy one day when she forgives herself. Decided to leave, Livy affirms at the family Thanksgiving gathering that she has learned from them what unconditional love is. Florence Umahara informs Livy that her secret boyfriend, Walter, is an MP guard of the German POWs. She wants Livy to meet him and asks her to take them on a drive southward to enjoy a day away from the camp. Upon meeting Walter, Livy realizes by his accent that he is a German POW wearing an MP uniform that Florence, an expert tailor, made for him to pass as American. Livy tells Florence that she and her sister could be charged with treason if she is caught helping a German POW escape across the border. Dropping off the sisters close to camp, Livy drives Walter to her home, instructing him to change his uniform with Ray's clothing. She then deliberately leaves the keys by the door, enabling him to steal her truck and drive off. The truck’s broken gas gauge reads full; Livy knows the nearly empty tank will quickly run out of gas, stranding him. Once Walter leaves, Livy quickly phones the police to report her truck stolen by a German POW. She also asks for a doctor, having begun labor. Burning the MP uniform evidence, Livy tosses a locket with Lt. Brown's photo into the fire. As she watches the uniform burn, Ray arrives, and she tells him she is in labor. After Livy gives birth to a boy, Livy and Ray share a tender kiss, finally recognizing that they are in love with each other. In the final scene Livy holds hands with Ray as he carries little Daniel out of their house on their first archeological dig on their farm as a family.",

    "plot": "In 1947, Humbert Humbert, a middle-aged European professor of English literature, travels to the United States to take a teaching position in New Hampshire. He rents a room in the home of widow Charlotte Haze, but only because he is sexually attracted to her 14-year-old daughter Dolores, also called \"Lo\", whom he sees while touring the house. Obsessed with girls of approximately her age (whom he calls \"nymphets\"), Humbert is immediately smitten with Lo and marries Charlotte only to be near her daughter. Charlotte finds Humbert's secret diary and discovers his preference for her daughter instead of her. Furious, Charlotte tells him that she is leaving him and that he can keep her home. She then runs out of the house and is hit by a car and killed, with Humbert eventually telling Lo about her mother's death. Charlotte's death frees Humbert to pursue a romantic and sexual relationship with Lo, whom he nicknames \"Lolita\". Humbert and Lo then travel the country, staying in various motels before eventually settling in the college town of Beardsley, where Humbert takes a teaching job and Lo begins attending Beardsley Prep School, an all-girls Catholic school. Humbert must conceal the nature of his relationship with Lolita from everyone – strangers they encounter when traveling as well as the administration at Beardsley. He presents his relationship with Lo to the world as a father and daughter. Over time, Lo's increasing boredom with Humbert, combined with her growing desire for independence and realization of their relationship, fuels a constant tension that leads to a fight between them. Humbert's affection for Lo is also rivaled by another man, playwright Clare Quilty, who has been pursuing Lo since the beginning of the pair's travels. Lo eventually escapes with Quilty, and Humbert's search for them is unsuccessful, especially as he does not know Quilty's name. Three years later, Humbert receives a letter from Lo asking for money. Humbert visits Lo, who is now married and pregnant. Her husband, Richard, knows nothing about her past. Humbert asks her to run away with him but she refuses, seemingly indicating that she has moved on from that part of her life and their romance. He gives her a substantial amount of money. Lo also reveals to Humbert how Quilty actually tracked young girls and took them to Pavor Manor, his home in Parkington, to exploit them for child pornography. Quilty kicked her out of his mansion after she did not want to participate in films with other men. Lo admits that she did not want to be with any man other than Quilty, stating \"He was the only man I was ever really crazy about\". After he visits Lo, Humbert tracks down Quilty, who is in a drug-induced stupor and murders him after chasing him around the mansion at gunpoint. After being chased by the police, Humbert is arrested and sent to prison for the murder. He dies in prison in November 1950 due to a coronary thrombosis, and Lo dies the next month on Christmas Day from childbirth complications.",

One night while at the gym, Lou is approached by FBI agents in search of information about Lou's estranged father, Lou Sr., and his criminal ties. Shortly after, Lou meets Jackie, a bisexual bodybuilder staying in town while preparing for a competition in Las Vegas. Lou offers Jackie steroids to enhance her training and though she initially refuses, Jackie agrees. After a night of sex, Jackie and Lou move in together. They fall in love over the following weeks as Jackie uses increasingly high doses of steroids during her training. Jackie and Lou attend an awkward dinner with JJ and Beth, during which Lou threatens JJ over his abusive behavior towards Beth. In retaliation, JJ reveals he and Jackie had sex her first night in town in exchange for a waitressing position at Lou Sr.'s gun range. Disgusted and angry, Lou tells Jackie that she wants to kill JJ because of his abuse of Beth, who is the only reason Lou hasn't left town. The next day, Beth is hospitalized due to severe abuse inflicted by JJ. At the bedside, Lou Sr. promises to protect Beth and deal with JJ. Unable to contain her rage due to steroid use, Jackie secretly breaks into Beth and JJ's home and brutally beats the latter to death. Lou discovers JJ's body, and fearing Jackie will be arrested, plots to frame her father for the murder. With Jackie's help, Lou loads JJ's body into his car and drives it over a cliff into a ravine revealed to be a disposal site for the bodies of Lou Sr.'s various criminal enemies. Lou lights the car on fire, creating a massive smoke plume that she knows will attract the authorities to the site the following morning. The next day, Lou returns to JJ and Beth's home to clean up evidence of the murder while Jackie continues her steroid use, growing more agitated. After an argument, Jackie leaves Lou and hitchhikes to Las Vegas for the bodybuilding competition. During her individual routine, Jackie hallucinates vomiting up a fully grown Lou before assaulting another contestant, leading to her arrest. Meanwhile, armed with knowledge of Lou and Jackie's involvement with JJ's murder after spotting the duo out driving the night before, Daisy blackmails Lou into a relationship. After Daisy intercepts Jackie's phone call from jail to Lou, Jackie contacts Lou Sr. to bail her out of jail. After doing so, Lou Sr. coerces Jackie to kill Daisy, the sole person connecting the women to the murder. After shooting Daisy at Lou's apartment, Jackie returns to Lou Sr., only to be knocked unconscious. Lou Sr. calls Lou and tells her that he has arranged for Jackie to take the rap for the deaths of JJ and Daisy, but Lou, who has helped her father kill in the past, announces her intention to cooperate with the FBI investigation if he sets Jackie up. Lou Sr. sends a police officer on his payroll to kill Lou, but she returns fire and kills him before driving to her father's home to rescue Jackie. At Lou Sr.'s manor, Beth, who has learned about her involvement with JJ's death, denounces Lou to her face. Lou finds and frees Jackie, but as they try to escape, Lou Sr. shoots Lou in the leg. Jackie, having grown to a gigantic size due to the steroid use, pins down Lou Sr., and Lou considers killing him before deciding to leave him for the police. Lou and Jackie drive off. The next morning, Lou realizes that Daisy is still alive in the truck bed despite her near-fatal wound. She strangles Daisy and dumps her body in a nearby field while Jackie sleeps.",

    "plot": "While stuck in Los Angeles traffic, Sebastian \"Seb\" Wilder has a moment of road rage directed at aspiring actress Mia Dolan. After a hard day at work, Mia's next audition goes awry because the casting director takes a phone call during an emotional scene. That night, her roommates take her to a lavish party in the Hollywood Hills, promising her that someone in the crowd could jump-start her career. After her car is towed, she walks home in disappointment. During a gig at a restaurant, Seb slips into jazz improvisation despite the owner's warning to only play traditional Christmas pieces. Mia hears him playing as she passes by. Moved, she enters the restaurant and observes Seb being fired for his disobedience. Mia attempts to compliment him as he storms out, but he brushes by her. Months later, she runs into Seb at a party where he plays in a 1980s pop cover band. Mia requests that Seb play \"I Ran\" for her. After the gig, they walk to their cars and – despite an obvious chemistry – lament wasting a lovely night on each other. Seb arrives at Mia's workplace, and she shows him around the Warner Bros. backlot, where she works as a barista, while expressing her passion for acting. He takes her to a jazz club, describing his passion for jazz and his desire to open his own club. Seb invites Mia to a screening of Rebel Without a Cause and she accepts, forgetting a date with her boyfriend. Bored with the latter date, she rushes to the theater and finds Seb as the film begins. When the screening is interrupted by a projector malfunction, Seb and Mia spend the rest of the evening together with a romantic visit to the Griffith Observatory. After more failed auditions, Mia decides, with Seb's encouragement, to write a one-woman play. Seb begins to perform regularly at a jazz club, and the two of them eventually move in together. A former bandmate of Seb invites him to be the keyboardist in a new jazz fusion band, which will give him a steady income. Although dismayed by the band's pop style, Seb signs on after hearing Mia trying to convince her mother that he is working on his career. The band finds success, but Mia knows their music is not the type of music Seb wants to perform. During the band's first tour, Seb and Mia argue: she accuses him of abandoning his dreams, while he claims that she liked him more when he was unsuccessful because it made her feel better about herself. Two weeks later, Seb misses Mia's play because of a photoshoot he had forgotten about. The play fails, very few people attend, and Mia overhears dismissive comments about her performance. Unable to forgive him for missing her play and their previous argument, Mia returns to her hometown of Boulder City, Nevada. Seb receives a phone call from a prominent casting director who attended Mia's play, inviting her to audition for an upcoming film. Knowing that this could be her big break, he drives in a hurry to Boulder City and finds her house since he remembered that she lived across the street from the library, where she fell in love with acting. Seb persuades her to attend, and she reluctantly agrees to go. During the audition the next day, Mia is asked to tell a story. In response, she sings about how her aunt, a one-time stage actress who eventually died from alcoholism, inspired her to chase her dreams. Confident the audition was a success, Seb encourages Mia to devote herself to acting. The two then recognize that they will always love each other despite what may come for their relationship. Five years later, Mia is living a happy life as a successful actress and married to a different man, with whom she has a daughter. That night, the couple stumble upon a jazz bar. Recognizing the logo she had once designed, Mia realizes that Seb has opened his own jazz club. Seb notices Mia in the crowd and begins to play their love theme on the piano. The two imagine what their happy life together would have been had their relationship thrived along with their careers, then acknowledge each other with a silent exchange of smiles and go their separate ways.",

Scott meets Ramona Flowers, an American Amazon delivery girl, at Julie's party, after having first seen her in a dream. Scott loses interest in Knives but does not break up with her immediately before pursuing Ramona. When Sex Bob-Omb plays in a battle of the bands sponsored by record executive Gideon Graves, Scott is attacked by Ramona's ex-boyfriend Matthew Patel. Scott defeats Patel, all the while, Sex Bob-Omb's competition is eviscerated, and Scott learns he must defeat her remaining six evil exes in order to date Ramona.

    "plot": "Bridget Jones, now the mother of school-aged Billy and Mabel, prepares to go out for the first time in a long time. While Daniel Cleaver babysits her children, Bridget attends the celebration of life held for her late husband, Mark Darcy, who was killed four years earlier while on a humanitarian mission in Sudan. She spends the torturous evening accepting condolences and being pressured to start dating again. Billy and Mabel are still awake when Bridget arrives home. Mabel observes a white owl that sits outside their window every night. Bridget reminisces about Mark singing to the children, and imagines seeing him do so. She then contemplates the often-contradictory advice and suggestions her friends and family offer. Bridget recalls her father Colin's dying wish that she live life fully. Coupling this with Dr Rawlings's suggestion to return to work, Bridget is motivated to make a fresh start. After Miranda calls for suggestions on a live interview for her women's program, Bridget contacts Richard and again becomes a show producer. Just as Bridget decides to re-enter the dating world, she meets 29-year-old park ranger Roxster, who pursues her on Tinder, and, after days of texting, they arrange a date. Bridget's friends offer advice before they go out. Bridget and Roxster's relationship evolves over the summer, with Mabel quickly labelling him as their \"new daddy\". Billy, still struggling to cope with his father's death, is less enthusiastic. Bridget is invited to Billy's class to discuss her job as a television producer. To demonstrate, she chooses a girl to act as producer, while she assumes the role as the presenter and interviews science teacher Scott Walliker. A seemingly simple explanation about an insect's life cycle turns more serious as Bridget asks questions about whether all living creatures have souls. At a birthday party for Bridget's colleague, Roxster makes a grand entrance. As they enjoy the evening, Roxster makes an offhand comment about wishing for a time machine. The next morning, Bridget awakens to find him gone. He subsequently ghosts her. Daniel, hospitalised due to a heart scare, contacts Bridget, feeling she is the only person who might care about him. He reflects on how alone he is, mentioning how he has not seen his teenage son for over a decade. Bridget, who deeply misses her deceased father, encourages Daniel to reconnect with his son. Roxster shows up at the studio to apologise to Bridget. He admits to having panicked, but declares that he is now ready to commit to her and the children. She then expresses the wish for a time machine so he could catch up, but she turns him down. That evening, after once again looking over her articles and memorabilia of Mark, she writes a heartfelt message to him. On Mark's birthday, Bridget, Billy and Mabel go to a park to release balloons with their messages to him attached. On a school trip to the Lake District, Bridget chats with Scott. He says he always expected to have children, but it never happened. When Bridget leaves to soothe a child, Billy confides to Scott that he fears forgetting his father. Scott assures him that his father is a part of him, so will never be fully gone. At the school winter holiday pageant, Billy sings \"I'd Do Anything\" as a tribute to his father. Bridget knows Mark would have been proud. She thanks Scott for helping her family heal, and invites him to join them and her friends at a pub afterwards. Arriving at the pub, Scott turns around to leave, but Bridget catches him outside. He confesses he is drawn to her, much like Newton's third law of being equal but opposite, before Bridget kisses him. One year later, Bridget throws a New Year's Eve at her house for her family and friends, including Scott and Daniel, who has reunited with his 16-year-old son Enzo. After the party, as Bridget tucks the children into bed, they observe as the owl flies away, which Scott also witnesses downstairs. Scott helps Bridget unzip her dress, and they kiss.",

She then says that her story doesn't start in this classroom, it actually starts in her house. Her house as she describes is a humble abode that, through ups and downs, ended up surrounded by an empire called the Hidalgo mansion. The Hidalgos are her next door neighbors but their lifestyle is completely different from hers. The Hidalgos own Alpha 3, one of the most influential companies in the country, whose headquarters is the most spectacular building in Barcelona. Alpha 3 refers to the three heirs to the empire, the Hidalgo brothers, Artemis, Ares and Apolo. Raquel has an unhealthy obsession with Ares but has never said a word to him. She knows everything he does and likes to collect information about him. Apolo thanks Raquel for letting them use her Wi-Fi as theirs is broken. She is confused and finds out that Ares has hacked into her computer and cracked the Wi-Fi password. The next day Raquel follows Ares into a secluded wooded area, where she confronts him about hacking into her computer. In response, he writes the password on her hand and asks her why it is a code that says, 'Ares, Greek God'. They exchange words which leads to Raquel admitting that she likes him and wants him to fall for her. At night she unplugs the Wi-Fi to assert that it's her, who is in control of it. But Ares climbs up her window into her room and plugs it back in. They share a steamy moment that leaves Raquel wanting for more. The next day Ares invites her to a party where she seduces him but doesn't let him get what he wants and exclaims that karma is a bitch. Later, she buys a drink for Apolo who gets too drunk and doesn't want to go back to his place. She takes him to her place with the help of her friend, Daniela. On the way to her place, Apolo accidentally breaks her phone. Ares again climbs up her window and says that until their father goes to work, they can't go back home. Ares opens up to her about his grandfather's death and how he too has allergies just like him. Ares gifts Raquel a new phone but she isn't very pleased with this gesture. So she goes to his house to return the phone but things get too steamy and they end up having sex. But after this, Ares acts indifferent which makes Raquel really angry and she storms off. She realizes that she has left her locket at his place so she goes back to get it. She ends up staying the night but in the morning he again dismisses her and makes her leave. Raquel's friends, Daniela and Yoshi bring her to a party to help her take her mind off of Ares where she gets drunk. Ares sees her in the street in a vulnerable position and takes her to her house. Ares admits that he has been pushing her away as she makes him feel things and how his father has already set a path for him which he has to follow. A path that doesn't involve falling for any girl. Ares tells Raquel that he genuinely does care about her and asks her to give him another chance. Everything seems to be going well this time. But that is until Ares takes Raquel to a family party to prove a point to his father. There, Raquel feels humiliated when she sees her mother working as a waiter. Raquel has a heartfelt conversation with her mother where she tells her not to follow in the footsteps of her father. Her father was a great writer but he never had the courage to publish his novel. She encourages her to cut all the drama and just tell Ares how she really feels about him. Raquel goes to Ares's place to tell him just that but isn't allowed into the house as everyone in his family feels that she is a distraction that will stop him from attaining his goals. Ares disobeys everyone and runs to the prom where he is shunned by Yoshi for breaking Raquel's heart so many times. Yoshi is furious and doesn't let Ares speak to Raquel. They exchange words that lead to a fight where Yoshi pushes Ares into a partially empty pool, spilling chlorine into as he turns away. Raquel takes him to the hospital and stays by his side the whole time until he completely recovers. After the scare, Ares's family lets him do what he wants. So, he decided to study medicine in Stockholm. At the airport, Ares confesses that he had purposefully broken their Wi-Fi so that he could talk to her. Raquel is finally brave enough to tell her story, so four months later she publishes her book called 'Through My Window'. The end credits roll as we see Ares climb up her window to surprise her.",

They are shocked upon learning that she had requested to be cremated and her ashes scattered from Roseman Covered Bridge, rather than be buried next to her late husband, Richard. Michael initially refuses, but while he and Carolyn look through the safe deposit box, they discover an envelope containing photographs, letters, and a key. The photos are of Francesca taken at the Holliwell Covered Bridge and the letters are from a man named Robert Kincaid. The key is to Francesca's locked hope chest. In it are three hardbound notebooks. There are also several National Geographic magazines, including one featuring Madison County's covered wooden bridges, old cameras, a book, and other mementos. The magazine includes a photo of Kincaid, who photographed the bridges; he is wearing Francesca's crucifix pendant. As Michael and Carolyn begin reading Francesca's notebooks, the film flashes back to 1965. Francesca, a WWII war bride originally from Bari, Italy, stays home while her husband and teenage son and daughter attend the state fair for the next four days.

He is famed as an irresponsible playboy and may also abdicate. Amber hopes this will finally be her big break as she heads to the royal family's palace for the press conference. Amber refuses to leave with the press pack when the prince fails to appear. Deciding to snoop around, she is mistaken for young Princess Emily's new American tutor, Martha Anderson. Amber plays along and assumes Martha's identity to investigate the rumors of abdication. Emily, who has spina bifida, tries to prank Amber into quitting but warms up to her after she does not treat her like an invalid.

Amber becomes attracted to Richard after discovering he is compassionate and responsible, although reluctant to take the throne. During this time, Emily tells her Richard's envious cousin Simon is next in line for the throne, which he desperately wants. Emily herself is ineligible to ascend, being a female. Amber also encounters Richard's beautiful, seductive ex-girlfriend, Sofia, who Richard suspects is only interested in him for his future title. Emily discovers Amber's identity, but promises not to expose her if she writes a story showing how excellent Prince Richard is. She follows him on horseback through the woods in pursuit of her story. When Amber's horse throws her and a wolf nearly attacks her, Richard saves her. Richard takes Amber to Richard's father's old hunting cabin, where Richard reveals that they argued about his desire to renounce the throne the last time he saw his father alive. Richard then shows Amber a mysterious poem written by his father, and they almost kiss, but are interrupted by the horses neighing. After Richard leaves to check on the animals, Amber searches the late king's desk and discovers a hidden compartment holding documents proving that the Prince was secretly adopted. She hides the documents and takes them back to the palace. Amber is reluctant to reveal the truth as it would deeply hurt Richard, but decides to tell him during a walk. He interrupts her confession with a kiss, and she realizes she is in love with him. Simultaneously, a suspicious Sofia and Simon search Amber's room and discover her true identity and Richard's adoption certificate. At the Christmas Eve Ball, as Richard prepares to be crowned, Sofia reveals his adoption certificate and Amber's true identity. Simon asserts himself as next in line for the throne as Richard storms off and rebuffs Amber's apologies, and she tearfully leaves the palace. Later, Helena reveals to Richard that she adopted him once told she could not have children. Apologizing for not telling him sooner, she insists she and the king consider him their son. Richard asks about Emily, and Helena tells him that she is, in fact, their biological child, their \"miracle\". Richard forgives his mother for her deception and promises not to let Simon win the throne so easily. Simon marries Sofia, but learns Helena must preside over the crowning ceremony. Meanwhile, Amber suspects that she can prove that Richard is the rightful king based on clues from his father's poem. Allowed back into the palace, Amber finds a secret proclamation declaring Richard the rightful heir hidden in a Christmas ornament made by the late king. Amber takes the document to the official chamber where Simon is crowned and arrives in time for Richard to be crowned instead; she quietly leaves Aldovia afterward. Back in NYC, Amber's magazine refuses to publish her story on Richard, calling it a \"puff piece\". In anger, she quits, deciding to blog about the faithful Richard instead. It becomes popular and eventually gains his attention. Amber is spending New Year's Eve at her father's diner when Richard surprises her. He professes his love to Amber and proposes, which she happily accepts.",

    "plot": "In the 1960s, in the Veneto region, two young people named Lola and Tommaso come from completely different worlds. Tommaso is the son of a wealthy family that owns a small bakery, which he is trying to expand into a larger factory to take advantage of the economic boom. His family, especially his mother, is very strict about social appearances and values. On the other hand, Lola is a bold and free-spirited girl whose mother, Zaira, used to work as a stewardess on the passenger ship Normandie and now lives with André, the former chef of the same ship. Their relationship is complicated, and it is possible that Lola is André’s daughter. Because of Lola’s character and past, Tommaso has decided to abstain from sexual relations with her until marriage, while satisfying his desires with other women, including prostitutes. However, Lola cannot bear the wait and tries to attract his attention through provocative behavior and daring walks. The film mainly focuses on Lola’s attempts to seduce Tommaso. Lola’s first attempt to get close to Tommaso in the bakery’s storage room is interrupted by the sudden arrival of Tommaso’s apprentice. A second attempt also fails during a walk by the riverbank. Later, in a café, a serious argument breaks out between them. Lola draws attention by dancing to the song “Let’s Twist Again” with three unknown soldiers, but Tommaso interrupts the dance and gets into a fight with them. After this incident, their paths diverge: Lola gets into a car with a stranger who tries to seduce her, but she manages to escape; meanwhile, Tommaso takes his anger out on a prostitute, insulting Lola in the process. Lola then tries to attract André, who is interested in her, but her mother’s intervention stops this from succeeding. Finally, Lola schemes and pretends she has been assaulted by the stranger in the car. Instead of feeling sympathy, Tommaso becomes angry that someone else has been with his fiancée before him. He then abandons his previous intentions and finally makes love to Lola for the first time, although he still directs his usual insults at her. This marks the beginning of their married life. In the end, they get married and invite all their friends to the wedding feast. There is a rumor that Lola also has a relationship with André during the celebration, without Tommaso knowing about it.",

She expects a proposal, but he breaks up with her instead. Intending to become a successful senator, he believes Elle is not \"serious\" enough for that life. Elle assumes she can win Warner back by achieving the same things. After months of studying, Elle scores a 179 on the Law School Admission Test. With that and her 4.0 GPA, she is accepted to Harvard Law School, which Warner will also attend. During the first semester, Elle discovers that her personality completely contrasts her distrusting East Coast classmates. Elle learns of Warner's engagement to his previous girlfriend, Vivian Kensington, and befriends local manicurist Paulette Bonafonté. Later, as Elle tells Warner she intends to apply for one of her professor's internships, he says she is not smart enough. Realizing that Warner will neither take her back nor take her seriously, Elle determines to demonstrate her understanding of the subject. The following semester, Harvard's most respected teacher, Aaron Callahan, hires some first-year interns, including Elle, Warner, and Vivian, to assist in a high-profile case involving prominent fitness instructor Brooke Windham, one of Elle's role models. Accused of murdering her husband, Brooke is unwilling to publicly reveal her alibi, but tells Elle she was secretly having liposuction at the time, which Elle promises not to disclose. Vivian gains new respect for Elle. Emmett Richmond, Callahan's junior partner, recognises Elle's potential. Callahan attempts to seduce Elle, who assumes that is why he recruited her. She briefly quits in disgust and tells Emmett what happened. After learning of Callahan's behavior, Brooke replaces him with Elle under Emmett's guidance, as law students may appear in court only under the supervision of a licensed attorney. While cross-examining Brooke's stepdaughter, Chutney, Elle eventually discovers a significant inconsistency in her story: Chutney testified she was home during her father's murder but did not hear the gunshot because she was in the shower after getting her hair permed that morning. Elle explains washing permed hair within the first 24 hours would deactivate the ammonium thioglycolate, pointing out Chutney's curls are still intact. Chutney admits her anger at having a stepmother her own age and that, intending to kill Brooke, she accidentally shot her father. Chutney is detained, Brooke is exonerated, and the media hail Elle. Warner asks Elle to take him back since she has proven herself, but she rejects him, realizing he is shallow and a \"complete bonehead\". However, she and Vivian become best friends, especially after Vivian dumps Warner. Elle gives the graduation speech two years later, while Warner graduates with no honors, job offers, or girlfriend. Emmett has started his law firm, with plans to propose to Elle later that night.",

    "plot": "In the late Victorian period, two cousins, nine-year-old Richard and seven-year-old Emmeline Lestrange, and galley cook Paddy Button, are shipwrecked on a lush tropical island in the South Pacific. Paddy cares for the children and forbids them \"by law\" from going to the other side of the island, where he finds an altar with bloody remains from human sacrifices. He also warns them against eating any deadly scarlet berries. He dies after a drunken binge, and the children rebuild their home on a different part of the island. Having reached puberty, the two go skinny dipping in the ocean, but Emmeline is uncomfortable with her sexual attraction to Richard and declines to share her \"funny\" thoughts with him. She is frightened by her first menstrual period and refuses to allow Richard to inspect her for what he imagines is a wound. Eventually, Richard recognizes his attraction to Emmeline. She ventures to the forbidden side of the island and sees the altar. Associating the blood with Christ's crucifixion, she concludes that the altar is God and tries to persuade Richard to go to the other side of the island to pray with her. Richard is shocked at the idea of breaking the law and they argue. When Richard tries to initiate sexual contact with Emmeline, she rebuffs him. He hides from her and masturbates. When a ship appears for the first time in years, Emmeline does not light the signal fire and the ship passes by without noticing them. When Richard confronts Emmeline about her failure, she asserts to his angry disbelief that the island is now their home and that they should remain there. Emmeline also reveals that she knows about Richard's masturbation and threatens to tell her Uncle Arthur about this. They fight and she throws a coconut at him, hitting him in the head by chance. Richard angrily slaps her and kicks her out of their shelter. Emmeline steps on a venomous stonefish. Weak from the poison, she pleads with Richard to \"take to God\". Richard carries her across the island and places her on the altar. Emmeline recovers and they swim naked in the lagoon. Noticing their bodies' reactions, they discover sexual intercourse and become lovers. Neither recognizes what is happening when Emmeline becomes pregnant, and they are stunned to feel the baby move inside her abdomen, assuming her stomach is causing the movements. Months later, Richard observes indigenous people performing a human sacrifice in front of the statue. He becomes frightened and runs away to find Emmeline, whom he finds in labor. Emmeline gives birth to a baby boy, whom they name Paddy. A ship led by Richard's father, Arthur, approaches the island and sees the family playing on the shore. Content with their lives, Richard and Emmeline walk away instead of signaling for help. Arthur assumes the mud-covered couple are not Richard and Emmeline. Visiting their original homesite, Richard searches for bananas while Paddy, unnoticed, brings a branch of the scarlet berries into the boat with Emmeline. Paddy tosses an oar out of the boat as it drifts from the shore. Richard swims after them followed closely by a shark. Emmeline throws the other oar at the shark, striking it and giving Richard time to get into the boat. The boat drifts oarless out to sea. After drifting for days, Richard and Emmeline wake up to find Paddy eating the scarlet berries. Hopeless, Richard and Emmeline eat the berries as well, and lie down to await death. Some hours later, Arthur's ship finds them. Arthur asks, \"Are they dead?\" The officer assures him, \"No, sir. They're asleep.\"",

    "plot": "Henry Roth, a marine veterinarian at Sea Life Park Hawaii on Oahu, only dates tourists to avoid any serious commitments. His closest friends are Ula, a marijuana-smoking Islander; Alexa, his androgynous assistant; Willy, his pet African penguin; and Jocko, a walrus that lives at the park. One day, Henry's boat breaks down, and while waiting for the Coast Guard at the Hukilau Café, he encounters art teacher Lucy Whitmore constructing architectural art with her waffles. Assuming she is a local, which prevents him from introducing himself, he unsuccessfully attempts to return to his womanizing routine. The next day, he returns to the café and re-encounters Lucy; they instantly connect over breakfast and Lucy offers to meet him again for breakfast the next morning. The next day, Lucy shows no recollection of ever meeting him. The restaurant owner Sue explains to Henry that the year before, Lucy and her father Marlin traveled to the North Shore to pick a pineapple for his birthday. While they were returning, a cow wandered through a broken fence and onto the road, and the ensuing car crash resulted in Lucy being diagnosed with anterograde amnesia, whereby she remembers everything up until the night before the crash. Although Lucy's short-term memory functions normally during the day, that day's experiences are lost when she sleeps, and she wakes up every morning thinking that it is Sunday, October 13. To spare her from the trauma of her condition, Marlin and Doug, Lucy's steroid-addicted brother, re-enact Marlin's birthday daily. Despite Sue's warning, Henry attempts to get Lucy to have breakfast with him several times, but when he unintentionally offends her one day he follows her home to apologize. There he meets Marlin and Doug, who instruct him to not speak to Lucy at breakfast. Heeding Marlin's specific orders to avoid the café, Henry arranges various daily schemes to meet Lucy on the road, most of the time managing to successfully impress her over multiple \"first\" dates and \"chance\" encounters. Later, Marlin and Doug permit Henry to continue encountering her when they discover Lucy regularly singing the Beach Boys' \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" in her painting studio just on the days Henry managed to meet her, the first major change in her routine since the crash. One day at breakfast, Lucy notices a police officer writing a ticket because of her expired license plates. With the ruse exposed, she is distressed to learn that her friends and family have maintained the charade for so long. However, while analyzing her reaction, Henry surmises that her strongest reactions are to feeling betrayed by her loved ones, rather than the actual memory loss. He devises a new strategy to let her know the truth by creating a video with her friends to calmly explain the situation and, rather than continuing her pre-crash routine, they plant the video in her room with a note to play it upon awakening. The strategy succeeds, allowing Lucy to emotionally process her situation and simultaneously be updated on current events, including her relationship with Henry. The couple's relationship blossoms via this method, with Lucy enjoying every \"first kiss\", and they continue to refine the process while enduring some humorous setbacks. When Lucy eventually discovers that Henry has abandoned 10 years of planning for his research study of walruses in Bristol Bay to help her manage her condition she decides that they need to end their romantic relationship and breaks up with him. Henry reluctantly helps her destroy her journal entries about their time together, effectively erasing it from her memory. Weeks later, as Henry prepares to leave for his research study, Marlin informs him that Lucy is teaching an art class at a brain-injury institute. As a parting gift, he gives Henry a Beach Boys CD; and as Henry pilots the boat and cries while listening to the CD he suddenly realizes that, since Lucy only sang \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" on days when they \"met\", Marlin's gift may be his way of hinting that Lucy had new learned memory retention. Henry hurries to Lucy's class, but despite not remembering him she happily reveals that she dreams of him nightly, and shows him dozens of portraits that she has painted of him, and they reconcile. Sometime later, she awakens and plays the tape marked \"Good Morning Lucy\", which now ends with her and Henry's wedding. Henry tells her on the tape that she is on his boat, and to put on a coat because it's cold outside. She is amazed to view glaciers through the porthole, and goes up on deck where she sees her father fishing, once again meets Henry, and joyfully embraces their young daughter, Nicole.",

Liz then gives birth to twin daughters, Annie and Hallie, but she and Nick divorce soon after, with each gaining custody of one of the girls. Nick raises Hallie on his vineyard in Napa, California, while Liz raises Annie in London, England. Nearly 12 years later, in 1998, the twins are sent to the same all-girls summer camp in Maine, Camp Walden. Annie and Hallie first meet at the end of a fencing match when they remove their masks and see that they look identical. A hostility between the twins leads to a prank war that ends when the camp counselors fall into one of Hallie's traps and decide to isolate the twins from the other girls. Living together in an isolation cabin, Annie and Hallie discover that they were born on the same day, and each has half of a torn wedding photograph of their parents. Realizing with delight that they are twin sisters, they hatch a plan to reunite their parents and get them to remarry. Each twin trains the other to impersonate her, with the intent to switch places at the end of summer camp. In London, Hallie meets Liz, the family butler Martin, and her maternal grandfather Charles, while Annie meets Nick and their family nanny Chessy in California. Much to Annie's dismay, she learns that Nick is engaged to Meredith Blake, a 26-year-old gold-digging publicist from San Francisco. Meredith acts friendly toward \"Hallie\", but she reveals to her assistant Richard that she plans to send Hallie to boarding school in Timbuktu after the wedding. Annie phones Hallie and implores her to bring Liz to California to try to break up Nick and Meredith, but Hallie refuses, desperate to spend more one-on-one time with Liz. After Chessy notices changes in \"Hallie's\" behavior, Annie confesses her identity to Chessy, who agrees to keep it a secret from Nick. While on the phone with Annie discussing Nick's impending wedding to Meredith, Hallie is caught by Charles, who encourages her to tell Liz the truth. After doing so, Liz is surprised but happy to learn that she has been with Hallie since the end of camp, and they both decide to travel to California to establish joint custody of the twins between each parent. The twins, with Martin and Chessy's help, arrange for a meeting between Nick and Liz at the Stafford Hotel in California. Upon reuniting with Liz, Nick happily learns that he has had Annie with him since the end of camp. Liz also meets Meredith and learns about her engagement with Nick. Annie and Hallie, with Chessy and Martin's help, attempt to recreate the night their parents met by arranging dinner on a yacht. Nick and Liz discuss their breakup, which occurred when Liz ran off after a fight, secretly hoping that Nick would follow her. They agree on shared custody of the twins but decide not to resume their relationship. Liz plans to fly back to London with Annie the next day, but the twins refuse to reveal which one is which unless the entire family takes a camping trip. Liz insists that Meredith go in her place so that she can become acquainted with the twins before marrying Nick. On the trip, the twins play a series of pranks on Meredith, leading her to furiously demand that Nick choose between her and them. Finally seeing Meredith's true nature, Nick breaks up with her. After the camping trip, Nick and Liz realize that they are still in love, but decide to go their separate ways, each with the twin that they have respective custody of. When Liz and Annie return to London, they find Nick and Hallie, who had taken a flight on Concorde. Nick says that he does not want to make the same mistake of not going after Liz again, and they share a kiss. The end credits reveal that Liz and Nick have remarried, with Annie and Hallie as their bridesmaids, and that Chessy and Martin have become engaged.",

He gave up trying to have sex after various failed attempts and lives alone in an apartment with a collection of action figures and video games. When a conversation at a poker game with his co-workers David, Jay, and Cal turns to past sexual exploits, they figure out that he secretly is still a virgin. Andy is mortified upon discovering the next day that everyone else at work has learned about the secret, including their boss Paula, who is attracted to him and later privately offers to take his virginity. He almost quits work in humiliation before David consoles him and recommends trying again to have sex. David, Jay, and Cal become determined to help Andy achieve this. They all give differing advice on how to interact with women. David invites him to join them for a speed dating event and unsuccessfully tries to reconnect with his ex-girlfriend Amy there. Jay drags Andy to various social events, books a painful chest waxing appointment, and sets him up with a prostitute, which all end with embarrassing results. Cal advises Andy to be confident and ask women questions instead of discussing himself. He practices this on a bookstore clerk named Beth, who quickly becomes intrigued by him. David gives Andy his pornography collection, encouraging him to masturbate. Andy eventually gets a date with a customer named Trish Piedmont. At the end of their first date, they almost have sex but are interrupted by her teenage daughter, Marla. Trish suggests they postpone having sex, and Andy enthusiastically agrees; they decide to abstain until their 20th date. Their relationship flourishes over the following weeks. She encourages Andy's dream of starting a business and helps fund it by selling his collectibles. After Marla argues with Trish over wanting birth control, Andy takes her to a group information session at a sexual health clinic, where she is mocked for being a virgin. Andy admits his virginity to defend her, earning him Marla's respect. Meanwhile, David suffers an emotional breakdown at work over his obsession with Amy, and takes a vow of celibacy. The breakdown prompts Paula to give his sales duties to Andy for the day and she later promotes him to floor manager due to his high sales quota. As Cal takes on Andy's previous role, he hires a woman named Bernadette to work at the store, hoping to match her with David so he can move on from Amy. After Jay's girlfriend, Jill, breaks up with him due to his infidelity, he concedes to Andy that sex can ruin a relationship. Following a reconciliation with Jill, Jay invites Andy and the others to a nightclub celebrating her pregnancy. Trish tries to initiate sex with Andy on their 20th date and becomes upset when he resists. They argue, and Andy leaves to meet his friends at a nightclub. He gets drunk and leaves with Beth to have sex at her apartment. Cal gets David and Bernadette to hook up, while Marla convinces Trish to reconcile with Andy. At Beth's, Andy sobers up and decides to leave without having sex, just as his friends arrive and encourage him to go back to Trish. Andy returns to his apartment to find Trish waiting for him. She has seen David's porn collection; he tries to explain, but she flees in alarm and disgust, fearing Andy may be a sexual deviant. While pursuing her on his bike, Andy collides with her car, flying through the side of a billboard truck. She rushes to his side, and Andy finally confesses that he is a virgin. Trish is relieved and accepting, and they profess their love for each other. They eventually marry in a lavish ceremony with everyone in attendance, having generated roughly $500,000 from the sales of his action figures to pay for it, before having sex for the first time.

Elio later finds himself jealous upon seeing Oliver kiss Chiara. Elio and Oliver spend more time together, taking long walks into town, and accompanying Elio's father on an archaeological trip. Elio is increasingly drawn to Oliver, even sneaking into Oliver's room to smell his clothing. Elio eventually confesses his feelings to Oliver, who tells him they cannot discuss such things. Later, in a secluded spot, the two kiss for the first time. Oliver is reluctant to take things further, and they do not speak for several days. Elio goes on a date with Marzia and the two have sex. Elio leaves a note for Oliver to end their silence. Oliver writes back, asking Elio to meet him at midnight. Elio agrees and they sleep together for the first time. Afterward, Oliver tells Elio, \"Call me by your name and I'll call you by mine\". The morning after, Elio is briefly conflicted about their encounter and takes out his sexual frustration by masturbating with a peach. When Oliver finds him, Elio cries about how little time he and Oliver have left together. Marzia confronts Elio after not hearing from him for three days. He responds indifferently, hurting her. As the end of Oliver's stay approaches, Elio's parents, who appear aware of the bond between the two, recommend that he and Oliver visit Bergamo together before Oliver returns to the U.S. They spend three romantic days together. Heartbroken after Oliver's departure, Elio calls his mother to ask her to pick him up from the train station and take him home. Marzia is sympathetic to Elio's feelings and says she wants to remain friends. Elio's father, observing his unhappiness, tells him that the bond he had with Oliver was rare and that he envies Elio because he never had what Elio and Oliver had. During Hanukkah, Oliver calls Elio's family to tell them he is engaged to be married to a woman he has been intermittently dating for a few years. Elio calls Oliver by his name and Oliver responds with his; Oliver says he remembers \"everything\". After the call, Elio sits by the fireplace and stares into the flames, tearfully reflecting, as his parents and staff prepare dinner.",

    "plot": "Lee Holloway is the socially awkward and emotionally sensitive youngest daughter of a dysfunctional family. After having been committed to a mental hospital following an extreme incident of self-harm, she attempts to readjust to normal life. Lee learns to type and applies for a job as a secretary for an eccentric yet demanding attorney, E. Edward Grey. Grey explains she is overqualified for the job, having scored higher than anyone he has ever interviewed, and warns her that it is \"very dull work\" as they only use typewriters; Lee, however, agrees to work under these conditions as she \"likes dull work\". Though at first Grey appears to be highly irritated by Lee's typos and other clerical errors, it soon becomes apparent that he is sexually aroused by her obedient behavior. When Grey discovers her propensity for self-harm, he confronts her and commands that she never hurt herself again. One day, Grey makes her bend over his desk and spanks her after she makes a spelling error in a letter; Lee finds herself excited by the ordeal. The two soon embark on a BDSM relationship from their typical employer–employee dynamic. Lee experiences a sexual and personal awakening through the sadomasochistic sexual encounters with Grey and falls deeply in love with him. Conversely, Grey displays insecurity concerning his feelings for Lee, as well as shame and disgust over his sexual habits. He begins to withdraw from her, despite her intentionally continuing to make typing errors in the hopes of receiving more corporal punishment. During this period of exploration with Grey, Lee also attempts to have a more conventional relationship with family friend Peter. She engages in lukewarm sex with him, during which he is confused by her desire to be spanked. After Lee sends Grey an envelope with a worm in it, he bends her over his desk and makes her remove her skirt and underwear, then masturbates behind her and ejaculates onto the back of her blouse. Lee then goes into the restroom where she pleasures herself in one of the stalls whilst looking at one of her typo letters during which she starts fantasizing about having a fellatio performance act on Grey. Feeling disgusted by this action Grey, following this encounter, fires Lee out of shame. Peter later proposes to Lee, who reluctantly accepts. However, while trying on her wedding gown, she flees and runs to Grey's office to declare her love for him. Grey, still uncertain about their relationship, tests Lee by commanding her to sit in his chair without moving her hands or feet until he returns. Lee willingly complies, despite being forced to urinate in her dress since she is not allowed to use the toilet. Hours pass as several family members and friends individually visit Lee to alternately attempt to dissuade or encourage her while Grey watches from afar, completely taken by Lee's compliance. Her refusal to leave the office, believed to be a hunger strike, draws media attention. Three days later, Grey returns to the office and takes Lee upstairs, where he bathes and feeds her. The pair marry and happily continue their dominant–submissive relationship.",

    "plot": "During the late 18th century in England, Mr and Mrs Bennet and their daughters—Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty, and Lydia—live at Longbourn, their rural estate in Hertfordshire. Mrs Bennet, eager to secure suitable marriages for her daughters, is delighted when wealthy bachelor Charles Bingley moves into nearby Netherfield Hall. At an assembly ball, Bingley, his sister Caroline, and his friend Mr Darcy meet the local society. Bingley and Jane are immediately taken with each other, while Elizabeth instantly dislikes the snobbish Darcy and overhears his dismissive remarks about her. Later, visiting the Bingleys, Jane falls ill and must stay to recuperate. While Elizabeth is visiting Jane at Netherfield, she verbally spars with the haughty Caroline and the aloof Darcy. Jane recovers and, soon after, Mr Bennet's cousin Mr Collins, a pompous clergyman, visits the Bennets; as the closest male relative, Collins will inherit Longbourn as it is entailed on the male line. Mr Collins tells Mrs Bennet he intends to propose to Jane, but she says Jane will soon be engaged and suggests Elizabeth, whom Collins considers an agreeable alternative. The Bennet sisters also meet the handsome and charming soldier George Wickham, whose father worked for the Darcy family. He wins Elizabeth's sympathy by telling her that Mr Darcy denied him his rightful inheritance. At the Netherfield ball, Elizabeth dances with Darcy, though the encounter is strained. The next day, Collins proposes to Elizabeth, who roundly rejects him; despite her mother's anger, her father supports her decision. Elizabeth is astonished when her close friend, Charlotte, fearing spinsterhood, announces her engagement to Mr Collins. The Bingley party unexpectedly returns to London. Elizabeth urges Jane to visit their aunt and uncle, the Gardiners, who live in London, hoping she reconnects with Bingley. Months later, Elizabeth visits Charlotte and Mr Collins, who reside next to Lady Catherine de Bourgh's estate in Kent. Elizabeth unexpectedly meets Darcy, who is Lady Catherine's nephew and visiting with his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam. Unaware that Jane is Elizabeth's sister, Fitzwilliam mentions that Darcy recently untangled Bingley from an imprudent match with an \"unsuitable\" family. Distraught, Elizabeth is then met by Darcy, who to her amazement proposes marriage, declaring his ardent love despite her inferior rank and family. Offended and angry, she refuses him. He defends separating Jane and Bingley, believing Jane indifferent to his friend, and criticises the other Bennets' occasional social impropriety. Elizabeth also cites his mistreating Wickham. Angry and heartbroken, Darcy delivers Elizabeth a letter describing Wickham's true character: Wickham squandered the bequest Darcy's father left him, then attempted to seduce Darcy's 15-year-old sister, Georgiana, into eloping to gain her fortune. Elizabeth returns home, as does Jane. Accompanying the Gardiners on a trip to the Peak District, Elizabeth reluctantly tours Pemberley, the grand Darcy estate in Derbyshire. She unexpectedly runs into Darcy, who invites her and the Gardiners to dine there. Darcy's manner has softened considerably, impressing the Gardiners, and Georgiana shares her brother's flattering reports about Elizabeth. An urgent letter from Jane reveals that Lydia has run off with Wickham. Darcy leaves abruptly, and Elizabeth returns home, certain she will never see Darcy again. Her mother fears Lydia's disgrace will ruin her other daughters' chances of good marriages. After a tense waiting period, Mr Gardiner sends news that Lydia and Wickham are now married, and the newlyweds return to Longbourn. Lydia lets slip to Elizabeth that it was Darcy who found them and paid for their wedding; he also purchased Wickham's military commission. Bingley and Darcy return to Netherfield and visit Longbourn. Bingley proposes to Jane, who accepts. Late that night, Lady Catherine arrives to see Elizabeth and demands she never become engaged to Darcy because, she claims, Darcy has been engaged to marry Lady Catherine's daughter, who has suffered poor health since infancy. Deeply insulted, Elizabeth orders her to leave. Walking early the next morning, Elizabeth encounters Darcy, who apologises for his aunt's intrusion. He professes his continued love and Elizabeth, her feelings radically altered, accepts his proposal. She tells her father the truth of Darcy's actions, and Mr Bennet gives Elizabeth his consent to marry, overjoyed she has found love.",

On her first day as an intern at Vance Publishing, Tessa shares an awkward encounter with coworker Trevor Matthews. Impressed with her work, Vance's owner Christian Vance takes Tessa, Trevor, and his secretary and girlfriend Kimberly to a Seattle-area work event. At a nightclub, Tessa and Trevor network with and impress a businessman considering an investment in Vance. Tessa drunk-dials Hardin, compelling him to track her down. He arrives at her hotel room to find a half-dressed Trevor (whose clothes were drying after Tessa accidentally spilt wine on them). Hardin kicks Trevor out of the room, and she fights with him before they have sex. The next morning, Hardin and Tessa fight again before she and Trevor leave with Vance, who informs his interns that he has secured financing from the businessman. Tessa and Hardin each come to regret ending their relationship. When Tessa returns to the apartment she shared with Hardin to retrieve some belongings, he steps in with his mother Trish, who believes they are still dating. Tessa plays along and finds that she enjoys spending time with both of them. Trish reveals to Tessa the source of Hardin's personality issues: he is traumatized after watching her get violently raped by men to whom his father Ken owed money when he was a boy. On the following day, her birthday, Tessa visits her mother Carol's and encounters her ex-boyfriend Noah. The two accidentally reveal that Tessa's long-lost father had come looking for her, but her mother had turned him away. Feeling betrayed, Tessa returns to Hardin's apartment and resumes their relationship. On Christmas Day, Hardin, Tessa, and Trish attend a holiday party at Hardin's dad Ken's. Furious at Ken's apparent willingness to forgive himself for his past misdeeds, Hardin gets drunk and assaults him. Tessa recounts the incident to Trevor, who warns her that her relationship with Hardin will not end well. Vance contacts Tessa to inform her that his company is expanding and moving to Seattle, and offers her a job there. On New Year's Eve, Tessa and Hardin attend a party hosted at a university frat house, where they reconnect with a number of their former college friends. Each misinterprets a conversation held by the other: Tessa assumes Hardin is cheating on her when she sees him asking for the forgiveness of another girl with whom he had previously been involved, and Hardin accidentally learns of Vance's offer and concludes that Tessa will leave him for Trevor. The couple fight, and she storms off. Hardin only sees apologetic texts sent by Tessa the next day after charging his phone. He calls her, but she reaches for her phone while driving and is injured in a car accident. Devastated by his indirect responsibility for the accident, Hardin decides to end his relationship with Tessa, but Trish talks him out of it. He races to Vance's farewell party, where Vance proposes to Kimberly. Tessa fights with Hardin once more before forgiving him. Later, the homeless man who spoke to Hardin earlier confronts the pair and reveals his identity: he is Tessa's father.",

One day, famous Hollywood actress Anna Scott enters the shop and buys a book. Shortly after she leaves, Will goes to buy his colleague Martin a juice, but bumps into Anna while rounding a street corner, spilling it on her. He takes her to his flat across the street so she can change. When leaving, she impulsively kisses him. Anna later invites Will to visit her at the Ritz Hotel. There, he is mistaken for a reporter and ushered into a press event for her new film. When asked, Will says he writes for Horse & Hound magazine. Anna asks to be William's date at his sister Honey's birthday party later that evening. Though his friends and family are surprised, she gets on well with everyone and enjoys herself. Later, the two enter a private neighbourhood park, where Anna again kisses Will. At a restaurant the next day, Will and Anna overhear a party of men at a nearby table discussing her, first praising and then disparaging her and equating actresses to prostitutes. He confronts them, then she introduces herself and calmly insults the stunned men. Anna invites Will to her hotel room, but after discovering that her movie star boyfriend, Jeff, has unexpectedly arrived from America, he leaves. Over the next six months, Will's friends Max, Bella, Bernie and Tony arrange a series of dates for him, but Will, heartsick over Anna, is uninterested in another relationship. One day, a distraught Anna appears at Will's doorstep, needing to hide due to a tabloid scandal. She apologises about Jeff and says their relationship is over. They discover shared interests, and discuss Will's print of Marc Chagall's 1950 painting La Mariée. Anna says it shows \"how love should be\" and that \"happiness isn’t happiness without a violin-playing goat\" as depicted in the painting. They have sex that night. The next morning paparazzi, inadvertently tipped off by Spike, besiege the house and take photos of Will, Anna, and a half-dressed Spike at the front door. Furious, she blames Will and leaves. Several seasons pass, and Will remains miserable. When he discovers that Anna is back in London making a film based on a Henry James novel, something he had suggested, he visits the set unannounced.

Will says he overheard what she said about him to her co-star. Anna explains that she was merely trying to keep her personal life private. She proclaims that she loves him, and pleads to rekindle their relationship. Will refuses, explaining that he would not recover if she left him again. Will meets his friends and sister at a restaurant with Anna's partly opened gift: Chagall's original La Mariée (\"The Bride\"). They halfheartedly support his decision about Anna until Spike arrives and calls him a \"daft prick\". Will admits his mistake, and everyone races across London to find Anna, who is holding a press conference at the Savoy Hotel. They arrive just as her publicist announces that Anna is taking a year off and is leaving the UK that night. A reporter asks about the embarrassing photographs taken at Will's flat, and Anna says they are just friends. Will asks her if she would consider being more than friends if he begs her forgiveness. She says she would, then requests the reporter to repeat his question, \"How long are you intending to stay here in Britain?\" Smiling, she answers \"Indefinitely\". Anna and Will marry, their wedding cake featuring the violin-playing goat from La Mariée. Spike and Honey also marry.

Male student Kuang Yumin invites her to join his patriotic drama club and she soon becomes a lead actress, inspiring both her audience and her colleagues. Inspired by the club's patriotic plays, Kuang persuades the group to make a more concrete contribution to the war against Japan. He devises a plan to assassinate Mr. Yee, a special agent and recruiter of the puppet government of Wang Jingwei set up by the Japanese occupation in China. The beautiful Chia Chi is chosen to take on the undercover role of \"Mrs. Mak\", the elegant wife of a trading company owner. She inserts herself into the social circle of Mrs. Yee. Chia Chi catches the eye of Mr. Yee and tries to lure him to a location where he can be assassinated. Chia Chi is still a virgin, and she reluctantly consents to having sex with another student involved in the plot in order to practice her role as a married woman. Attracted to Chia Chi, Yee nearly falls for the trap but backs out at the last minute. Soon after, Mr. and Mrs. Yee move back to Shanghai, leaving the students with no further chance to complete their mission. While they are preparing to disband, a former subordinate of Yee turns up unannounced and tells them that he is aware of their plans. After a violent struggle, the students kill the subordinate and then go into hiding. Shanghai 1942 Three years later, in Japanese-occupied Shanghai, Chia Chi again encounters Kuang, who is now an undercover agent of the Kuomintang (KMT) secret service, the Juntong, which is seeking to overthrow the Japanese occupation forces and the puppet government. Kuang enlists her into a renewed assassination plan to kill Yee, who has become head of the secret police department under the puppet government, and is responsible for torturing and executing resistance members working for the KMT. Chia Chi's advances to become Yee's mistress are reciprocated. During their first sexual encounter, Yee violently rapes Chia Chi. Over the next few weeks, their sexual relationship becomes more consensual and affectionate, stirring conflicting emotions in Chia Chi. When Chia Chi reports to her KMT superior officer, she exhorts him to carry out the assassination soon, so that she will not have to continue her sexual liaison with Yee, but she is told that the assassination needs to be delayed for strategic reasons. Chia Chi describes the emotional conflict she finds herself embroiled in, sentimentally bound to a man whom she is plotting to help assassinate. When Yee sends Chia Chi to a jewelry store with a sealed envelope, she discovers that he has arranged for a large and extremely rare six-carat pink diamond for her, to be mounted in a ring. This provides the Chinese resistance with a chance to get at Yee when he is not accompanied by his bodyguards. Soon after, Chia Chi invites Yee to accompany her to collect the diamond ring. While entering the jewelry shop, she notices that all those involved in the assassination plot are undercover outside. When she puts on the ring, she is overcome by emotion and quietly urges Yee to leave. Understanding her meaning, he immediately flees the shop and escapes the assassination attempt. By the end of the day, most members of the resistance group have been captured. Yee's deputy was aware of the resistance cell, but did not inform Yee because he hoped to use the opportunity to catch their leader. In emotional turmoil, Yee signs the resistance members' death warrants. Chia Chi and the others are taken to a quarry to be executed. As the resistance members group are forced to their knees at gunpoint, a sad Kuang gazes at Chia Chi.

    "plot": "Working as the stunt double for action star Tom Ryder, Hollywood stunt performer Colt Seavers breaks his back during a stunt gone wrong and abandons his career and his girlfriend, camerawoman Jody Moreno. Eighteen months later, Colt, now a valet for a small Mexican restaurant, is contacted by Gail Meyer, Tom's film producer. She tells him that Jody is directing her first film, a space opera film titled Metalstorm starring Tom, and that she wants Colt to join the production in Sydney. After arriving on set, Colt learns that Jody never asked for him and is still angry about their breakup, with the film serving as a less-than-subtle attempt to air her grievances at Colt. Gail reveals that Tom has disappeared after getting into trouble with \"very bad people,\" and she wants Colt to find him before his absence causes the already-overbudget film to be canceled. Not wanting Jody's directorial debut ruined, Colt agrees. He first goes to Tom's apartment, where he meets Tom's girlfriend and co-star, Iggy. She gives Colt a lead, so he visits a nightclub, where he meets drug dealer Doone, who tricks Colt into drinking a cocktail laced with a hallucinogen. After getting into a fight with Doone's henchmen, Colt visits Tom's hotel room, where he finds a dead body in a bathtub full of ice. When Colt returns with the police, the body has disappeared. As the production of Metalstorm continues, Colt and Jody begin to rekindle their relationship until Gail abruptly informs him that he must return to the United States. Instead, he continues looking for Tom by tracking down his personal assistant Alma Milan. She hands him Tom's phone, which Tom and Gail had been searching for, before they are both attacked by Tom's head of security, Dressler, and his team, who are looking for the phone. Colt and Alma defeat them after an extended chase through Sydney involving a rubbish truck. He and his long-time friend Dan Tucker, the stunt coordinator on Metalstorm, unlock the phone and discover a video of an intoxicated Tom accidentally killing his most recent stunt double, Henry Herrera (the man in the bathtub), while sparring at a party. The henchmen attack Colt and Dan, destroying the phone with shotgun pellets. Dan escapes, but Colt is captured and brought face-to-face with Tom, who has been hiding out on a yacht on Gail's instructions. He reveals that Gail is framing Colt for the crime using deepfake technology to replace Tom's face with Colt's on the incriminating video and that he orchestrated Colt's accident because he felt that Colt was stealing the spotlight from him. Henry's body is discovered, and the doctored video is released to the media, while Gail tries to convince Jody that Colt is guilty. Colt escapes and is presumed dead after a boat chase ends in an explosion, but Colt survives and swims to safety. The next day, Tom arrives at the Metalstorm set, and production continues. Colt secretly returns to the set and convinces Jody of his innocence. Together, they trick Tom into participating in a stunt sequence and confessing while he is wired with a lav mic while the rest of the stunt team, led by Dan, hold off Tom's bodyguards. Gail steals the recording at gunpoint and tries to escape in a helicopter with Tom, but Jody helps Colt leap onto the helicopter in mid-air. He retrieves the recording and falls onto a crash mat prepared by Dan, while the helicopter crashes with Gail and Tom in it. Metalstorm's trailer premieres at San Diego Comic-Con, with Jason Momoa being made the new lead and Alma the film's new producer; the film eventually becomes a box office hit. Colt is exonerated, and he and Jody get back together. In a post-credits scene, Gail and Tom survive the crash, but authorities arrive to detain them. Tom leaves Gail to be arrested in order to call his agent, accidentally triggering a series of radio-controlled pyrotechnics and blowing himself up. Alma calls Momoa's agent.",

    "plot": "On November 9, in Palm Springs, Nyles wakes up and fails to consummate sex with his girlfriend Misty. That evening, Nyles attends a wedding reception for Tala and Abe. There, he bonds with the maid of honor, Tala's depressed sister Sarah. Nyles and Sarah leave the party to have sex in the nearby desert. As he undresses, Nyles is hit by an arrow shot by an assailant. The injured Nyles crawls into a cave, warning Sarah not to follow him. Concerned for Nyles, Sarah follows him and is sucked into a vortex. Sarah wakes up and realizes that it is November 9 again. She confronts Nyles, and he explains that by following him into the cave, Sarah has become stuck in a time loop with him; falling asleep or dying resets the loop, repeating November 9. Nyles reveals that the man who shot him, Roy, is from the wedding and that Nyles inadvertently trapped him in the time loop. For revenge, Roy sometimes hunts down Nyles, as he enjoys putting Nyles through pain even though his \"deaths\" are only temporary. Sarah tries various methods to escape the loop, but is unsuccessful. Nyles, having already been in the loop for a long time, has become complacent and carefree, abandoning hope of escape. Sarah resigns herself to her fate and adopts Nyles' carefree and reckless lifestyle. Nyles and Sarah become close, and they begin to look forward to their days together, where they are free to do anything without consequence. One night, Nyles and Sarah camp out in the desert, get high, and have sex. The day after, Sarah sleeps in and is woken up by Abe, with whom she had sex on November 8, the night before the wedding. Guilt-ridden, Sarah refuses to talk to Nyles about their previous night, expressing nihilism about their life in the loop. After being pulled over by Roy disguised as a cop, Sarah runs him over. Sarah and Nyles argue, leading Nyles to admit that he had sex with Sarah many times in the loop, something he previously lied about. An angry Sarah starts avoiding Nyles. Nyles feels lost without Sarah and spends days aimlessly moping, discovering Abe and Sarah's affair in the process. One day, Nyles visits Roy at his home in Irvine. Having now experienced a painful injury at the hands of Sarah, Roy realizes what he's put Nyles through, and they reconcile. Meanwhile, Sarah spends her days studying to become an expert in quantum physics and general relativity. After some experimentation, she believes that exploding oneself in the cave will break the time loop. Sarah offers Nyles a chance to escape with her, but he confesses his love for her and asks if they can stay in the loop together forever. Sarah refuses, resolved to try her escape plan without him. Sarah attends the wedding one last time, giving a heartfelt speech to Tala, and then travels to the cave with explosives. Nyles has a change of heart, and he rushes to the cave to leave with Sarah. He states that he would rather die with her in an explosion than remain in the loop alone. Sarah reciprocates his feelings, and they kiss in the cave, as she presses the detonator. The two then relax in the pool of a nearby house, which Nyles had shown Sarah during one of their loops. The residents return and catch them in the pool, which seems to indicate that the plan has worked and it is now November 10. In a mid-credits scene, Roy, having gotten a voicemail from Sarah explaining her plan to escape the loop, returns to the wedding and asks Nyles if the plan would work. Nyles does not recognize Roy, who smiles, realizing that Nyles is out of the time loop.",

Near the end of their work contract, Ennis and Jack have a brawl that leaves both of them bloodied. Before parting ways, Ennis offhandedly laments that he left one of his shirts on the mountain. Ennis marries his longtime fiancée Alma Beers and they have two daughters: Alma Jr. and Jenny. Jack returns the next summer seeking work, but Aguirre, who observed Jack and Ennis engaging in homosexual activity on the mountain, tells him he has no work for guys who \"stem the rose\". Jack moves to Texas, where he meets rodeo rider Lureen Newsome, the daughter of a wealthy agricultural machinery manufacturer; they marry and have a son. After four years apart, Jack visits Ennis. Upon meeting, they kiss passionately, which a stunned Alma inadvertently sees. At a motel room, Jack wants them to create a life together, but Ennis refuses to abandon his family and is haunted by a childhood memory of his father showing him the body of a man who was tortured and killed for suspected homosexuality. Ennis and Jack meet infrequently for private fishing trips while their respective marriages deteriorate. Lureen abandons the rodeo and goes into business with her father, with Jack working in sales. Lureen's father has a strong dislike for Jack and openly disrespects and belittles him. Alma and Ennis divorce in 1975. Upon hearing about it, Jack drives to Wyoming and tells Ennis that they should live together, but Ennis refuses to move away from his children. Alma takes custody of Alma Jr. and Jenny, and marries Monroe, manager of the grocery store where she works. Ennis is invited to Thanksgiving dinner. While alone in the kitchen, Alma confronts Ennis about Jack. The two spar, causing Ennis to storm out and cease contact with Alma. Ennis has a brief romantic relationship with Cassie, a waitress. Jack and Lureen befriend Randall and Lashawn Malone, and it is implied that Jack and Randall have a brief affair. At the end of a tryst disguised as a fishing trip, Ennis says he cannot see Jack again for months due to work demands. The pair argue, before Jack embraces a crying Ennis. A postcard Ennis sent Jack is returned stamped with \"Deceased\". Ennis calls Jack's phone number. Lureen answers and says Jack died when a car tire exploded in his face. While hearing what happened, Ennis envisions men fatally beating Jack with a tire iron. Lureen says Jack requested his ashes be scattered on Brokeback Mountain. Ennis visits Jack's parents hoping to carry out his wish. Jack's father declares that Jack's ashes will be interred in a family plot. Jack's mother allows Ennis to visit Jack's old bedroom. Ennis finds the shirt he thought he left on the mountain, which Jack had secretly kept, nested inside one of Jack's shirts. Ennis embraces the shirts and silently weeps. Jack's mother allows him to keep them. Years later, an aging Ennis lives alone and reclusive in a trailer. His grown daughter, Alma Jr., visits him to announce her engagement to Kurt, who works in the oil fields. She asks for her father's blessing and invites him to the wedding. Ennis hesitates to come due to upcoming work commitments, then agrees to attend the wedding. As Alma Jr. leaves, she forgets her jacket, so Ennis puts it into the closet where the two shirts hang, Jack's shirt now inside Ennis's. Next to them, tacked to the closet door, is a postcard of Brokeback Mountain. With tears in his eyes, he stares at the mementos, and says, \"Jack, I swear...\"",

She is put off by his invitation to dinner, but shows up anyway. When Gary's mother cannot chaperone him on a press tour performance in New York City, he invites Alana. He is jealous when Alana begins dating his co-star Lance, but they break up after Lance reveals he is an atheist during Shabbat dinner with her Jewish family. Gary begins selling waterbeds and reconnects with Alana at a teenage trade expo. Mistaken for a murder suspect, Gary is arrested and Alana runs after him to the police station, but he is soon released. Alana joins Gary's waterbed business, acting seductively on the phone to land a potential customer. Introducing her to his talent agent, he is upset that she is open to nudity but refuses to show him her breasts. She impulsively does so, but slaps him when he asks to touch them. They open a \"Fat Bernie's\" storefront for their waterbeds, and Alana is hurt when Gary flirts with his classmate Sue. Peeking in on them making out in the back room, Alana kisses a man on the street before storming off. Gary's agent secures Alana an audition for a film starring veteran actor Jack Holden, who takes her to the Tail o' the Cock restaurant, where Gary and his friends are also dining. An inebriated Alana makes Gary jealous, and Holden's friend, film director Rex Blau, convinces him to recreate one of his motorcycle stunts on a nearby golf course, bringing the entire restaurant along. Alana topples off the bike before Holden jumps over a flaming sand trap, and Gary runs to her side. Reconciled, they walk to the waterbed store, where Gary stops himself from touching a sleeping Alana's breast. The 1973 oil crisis sweeps the country, forcing the waterbed manufacturer to close. Alana, Gary, and his friends make one final delivery to the home of Jon Peters, who humiliates Gary before leaving to meet his girlfriend, Barbra Streisand. Filling up the waterbed inside, Gary intentionally leaves the hose running, with Alana's approval. They drive away but are waved down by an agitated Peters, whose car has run out of gas, and leave him at a crowded gas station when he violently commandeers a gas pump. Gary stops to smash Peters's car, but runs out of gas as well. Alana maneuvers their truck backward down a long hill to a gas station, impressing Gary, but causing her to question her recent decisions. Inspired by a campaign poster, Alana reaches out to her old classmate Brian, who brings her on as volunteer staffer for Joel Wachs, a city councilman running for mayor. Gary briefly joins her but overhears that pinball will soon be legalized in the Valley and decides to open an arcade, leading to an argument with Alana about their difference in age and their fraught relationship. Emasculating Gary to make herself feel superior, Alana offers to drive him home in an attempt to make peace, but Gary drives off alone. Later, Gary prepares for the opening night of his arcade, remodeling his storefront into \"Fat Bernie's Pinball Palace.\" That same night, Alana nearly shares a kiss with Brian, but is interrupted by an invitation from Wachs. Thinking it is a date, she is dejected to discover Wachs wants her to pose as the girlfriend of his secret boyfriend, Matthew, to save him from political embarrassment. Alana walks a deeply hurt Matthew home, and they commiserate over the men in their lives. She goes to the arcade to find Gary, who has left to look for her at Wachs's office, with her sisters' encouragement. They eventually run to each other's arms and return to the arcade, where Gary announces her as \"Mrs. Alana Valentine.\" Sharing a kiss, they run into the night, and Alana tells Gary that she loves him.",

    "plot": "In 1818 Hampstead, the fashionable Fanny Brawne is introduced to poet John Keats through the Dilke family. The Dilkes occupy one half of a double house, with Charles Brown occupying the other half. Brown is Keats' friend, housemate, and associate in writing. Fanny's flirtatious personality contrasts with Keats' notably more aloof nature. She begins to pursue him after her siblings Samuel and Toots obtain his book of poetry, \"Endymion\". Her efforts to interact with the poet are fruitless until he witnesses her grief for the loss of his brother, Tom. Keats begins to open up to her advances while spending Christmas with the Brawne family. He begins giving her poetry lessons, and it becomes apparent that their attraction is mutual. Fanny is nevertheless troubled by his reluctance to pursue her, as to which her mother surmises, \"Mr. Keats knows he cannot like you, he has no living and no income.\" It is only after Fanny receives a valentine card from Brown that Keats passionately confronts them and asks if they are lovers. Brown sent the valentine in jest, but warns Keats that Fanny is a mere flirt playing a game. Fanny is hurt by Brown's accusations and Keats' lack of faith in her; she ends their lessons and leaves. The Dilkes move to Westminster in the spring, leaving the Brawne family their half of the house and six months rent. Fanny and Keats then resume their interaction and fall deeply in love. The relationship comes to an abrupt end when Brown departs with Keats for his summer holiday, where Keats may earn some money. Fanny is heartbroken, though she is comforted by Keats' love letters. When the men return in the autumn, Fanny's mother voices her concern that Fanny's attachment to the poet will hinder her from being courted by a more obviously eligible suitor. Fanny and Keats secretly become engaged. Keats contracts tuberculosis the following winter. He spends several weeks recovering until spring. His friends collect funds so that he may spend the following winter in Italy, where the climate is warmer. After Brown impregnates a maid and is unable to accompany him, Keats finds accommodation in London for the summer, and is later taken in by the Brawne family following an attack of his illness. When his book sells with moderate success, Fanny's mother gives him her blessing to marry Fanny once he returns from Italy. The night before he leaves, he and Fanny say their tearful goodbyes in privacy. Keats dies in Italy the following February of complications from his illness, as his brother Tom had done. In the last moments of the film, Fanny cuts her hair in an act of mourning, dons black attire, and walks the snowy paths that Keats had walked many times. It is there that she recites the love sonnet that he had written for her, called \"Bright Star\", as she grieves the death of her lover.",

    "plot": "Cairo Sweet, an 18-year-old girl, lives alone in her wealthy family's mansion in Tennessee. Her attorney parents are away on a business trip while she completes her senior year in high school. Cairo takes the creative writing class of teacher Jonathan Miller, and impresses him with her wide knowledge in literature and her familiarity with Miller's own book, Apostrophes and Ampersands. Miller has not written since he got married and started teaching. His emotionally unavailable wife, Beatrice, is a more successful author who disdains her husband's lack of ambition and failure to write new material. Cairo has to write a college admission essay for Yale University, with the subject being her \"greatest achievement to date\", but she cannot find anything worthy to write about. Winnie, Cairo's best friend, tells her to experience the excitement of a teacher–student affair such as she intends to do with the school's baseball coach and physics teacher, Boris Fillmore, who is Miller's best friend. Winnie suggests that Cairo seduce Miller after noticing their intellectual connection and Miller's obvious attraction to her. Cairo and Miller begin to spend more time together outside class, sharing common interests in novels, poems and Tennessean culture. Miller assigns Cairo to write a short story in the style of her favorite author, and she chooses Henry Miller; despite being reluctant due to the author's provocative style, Miller approves. When he accidentally takes Cairo's cell phone, she asks him to return it personally. Miller arrives at her parents' mansion, where Cairo welcomes him in a sexy dress, and they kiss in the rain. Inspired, she writes an erotic short story about a sexual relationship between a teacher and his student. While Miller reads it alone, he becomes extremely aroused and masturbates to it. Miller declares the story unacceptable and demands that Cairo rewrite it, citing she was meant to match Henry Miller's writing style, not subject matter. Cairo calls out his cowardice and hypocrisy. Offended by Miller's rejection, Cairo sends the story to the school's vice principal, Joyce Manor, as revenge to expose a possible affair between them. She also takes advantage of Winnie's attraction to her by convincing her to send sexual photos of themselves to Fillmore, leading them to undress and kiss passionately. Manor questions Cairo and Miller separately about their relationship. Despite claiming that nothing inappropriate has happened between them, Miller has to take full responsibility as the adult in the situation, resulting in his suspension. This causes a rift in his friendship with Fillmore, who blames him for not knowing his limits as a teacher. An argument with Beatrice about what happened also prompts Miller to take his repressed anger out on his wife and point out the toxic nature of their marriage. Realizing what Cairo's actions have done to Miller, Winnie asks her to withdraw the charges against him, but Cairo refuses, calling Miller's downfall her \"greatest achievement to date\". Winnie threatens to testify against Cairo, but Cairo blackmails her with the photos they took, which would cause Fillmore's suspension as well. She writes her experiences into her admission essay in the same style Miller used in his book. Miller and Cairo see each other outside before the hearing. She stares at him with an unreadable, teary-eyed expression, before letting out a slight smile.",

Brad and Sarah become friendly and, on a dare to shock gossipy housewives, kiss in the park, but resolve not to act on their mutual attraction. Sarah and Brad, enjoying each other's company, start regularly meeting at the public pool under the guise of a play date for their kids. One day, dozens of parents panic when they see recently paroled sex offender Ronnie J. McGorvey snorkeling in the water with the children, as there are posters of him plastered all over town. After Ronnie is escorted away by the police, the pool is closed due to rain. Sarah and Brad take Lucy and Aaron back to her house and put the kids to bed. While Sarah is drying towels in her basement, Brad comes down and they have sex. Ronnie lives with his mother May, who believes that Ronnie's pedophilia would be cured if he met a woman his own age. He reluctantly agrees to go on a date she has arranged for him with a woman named Sheila. It ends badly when he masturbates next to her in her car by a children's playground. When Brad skips taking the bar exam again, his wife Kathy grows suspicious and tells him to invite Sarah, Richard, and Lucy over for dinner. The intimacy evident between Brad and Sarah confirms her suspicions, so Kathy arranges for her mother to come for an extended visit. When Brad's football team plays its final game, Sarah attends and cheers as Brad scores the winning touchdown. Afterwards, they make out on the field, with Brad convincing her to run away with him although she initially suggests they end the affair. Brad's friend Larry Hedges is a former police officer who went on disability after accidentally killing a child. He has been obsessed with watching Ronnie, ever since his release to his mother's house and spends much of his time harassing him. One night, he enters Ronnie's neighborhood with a megaphone. When May comes out to confront Larry, she suffers a heart attack in the process when Larry pushes her to the ground, causing him to be arrested. She is taken to a hospital, where she dies. When Ronnie returns home from the hospital, he finds a note written by May saying: \"Please be a good boy.\" Distraught, he destroys much of his mother's collection of Hummel figurines before grabbing a knife. That same night, as Sarah and Brad had agreed to run away together, they plan to meet in the park. As he heads to the park, he is distracted by skateboarding teenagers. Attempting to try a jump himself, Brad knocks himself out. When he regains consciousness, he asks the paramedics to call his wife to meet him at the hospital.

When Lucy disappears, Sarah panics and rushes to find her, forgetting about Brad. She finds her staring at a street lamp and places her back into her car. Larry arrives to apologize to Ronnie about May, but he discovers that Ronnie has castrated himself and is bleeding to death. He races Ronnie to the hospital, where Kathy also arrives for Brad.",

Lost and struggling to operate the stickshift car, Edward accepts Vivian's offer to drive him to the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel. Impulsively, he hires her for the whole night, and despite initial awkwardness, they have sex in his penthouse suite. The following day, Edward asks Vivian to stay for the week, as he must attend a series of business events while attempting to acquire Jim Morse's shipbuilding company. After negotiating, Edward and Vivian agree on $3,000. He also gives her money to buy appropriate clothes. When Vivian tries to shop on Rodeo Drive, snobbish and rude saleswomen turn her away because of the way she looks. She asks hotel manager Barney for assistance. He gets store saleslady Bridget to find her a cocktail dress for that evening's business dinner. Later, she gets Barney to teach her table etiquette. Edward is astounded by Vivian’s transformation. At dinner, he introduces Vivian to Morse and his grandson David, who is to take over the company. The dinner does not go well, as they are unhappy with Edward's plan to dismantle their company. Later, Edward tells Vivian about his personal and business life, including his estranged relationship with his late father. Edward takes Vivian along as his date to a polo match. When Philip sees Vivian talking to David Morse, he tells Edward his suspicions that she is a corporate spy. Edward dismisses Philip's concerns by explaining their arrangement. With the knowledge of Vivian's true background, the married Philip talks to her alone and crudely propositions her for her services. Back in Edward's suite, Vivian is angry with Edward for exposing her in that way. He apologizes, admitting that he was jealous of Vivian talking to David. Edward takes Vivian by private jet to see La traviata at the San Francisco Opera, a story about a prostitute who falls in love with a wealthy man. She is moved, and she breaks her \"no kissing\" rule before having sex with him. Believing Edward has fallen asleep, Vivian says she loves him. As the week is almost finished, Edward offers to get Vivian a condominium and an allowance, promising to visit her regularly. However, Vivian feels he is treating her like a prostitute. She shares her childhood fantasy of being rescued by a knight on a white steed. Edward meets with Morse, but chooses to work with him to save his company instead of dismantling it. Philip, furious that Edward's new direction has cost him a fortune, goes to the Beverly Wilshire to confront him. He finds Vivian. Blaming her for Edward's changes and angry at his business decision, Philip hits her and attempts to rape her. Edward arrives, pulls Philip off Vivian, punches him, and fires him. After completing his business in Los Angeles, Edward asks Vivian to stay with him for one more night, but only if she wants to, not because he is paying her. She gently refuses and leaves after telling him she thinks he has \"lots of special gifts\". Vivian returns to her apartment hotel to pack for her move to San Francisco to get a new job and a high-school diploma. She gives her roommate, fellow prostitute Kit De Luca, some money and tells her she has \"a lot of potential\". Kit leaves sex work and enrolls in beauty classes. Vivian then waits in the apartment for the bus. Edward has the chauffeur take him to her apartment. He climbs out of the white limousine's sunroof and ascends the fire escape to \"rescue\" Vivian, just like the knight in her childhood fantasy. When he asks her what happens after the knight rescues her, she responds, \"She rescues him right back\", and kisses him.",

Her parents, upset by her notions of grandeur and believing her to be stalling her life, inform Sybylla that they can no longer afford to keep her in the household. They send her to board with her wealthy maternal grandmother in hopes of teaching her socially accepted manners and behaviour. Upon arriving, Sybylla swiftly feels out of place in her new environs. She is soon courted by two local men, jackaroo Frank Hawdon, whom she ignores, and well-to-do childhood friend Harry Beecham, of whom she grows increasingly fond.

She returns to her grandmother's home when Harry is sent on a tour of their properties, with everyone on both estates coyly approving of their romance.

Frank attempts to derail Harry and Sybylla's budding relationship by sparking rumours, which leads to increasing tensions between the two. Harry and Sybylla take turns attempting to make the other jealous at a ball, leading to Harry's surprise proposal. Sybylla gruffly rejects him, to everyone's surprise.

    "title": "In the Mood for Love",
    "plot": "In 1962 British Hong Kong, Shanghainese expatriates Chow Mo-wan, a journalist, and Su Li-zhen (Mrs. Chan), a secretary at a shipping company, rent rooms in adjacent apartments. Each has a spouse who often works late, leaving them alone during overtime shifts. Due to the friendly but overbearing presence of Su's Shanghainese landlady, Mrs. Suen, and their bustling, mahjong-playing neighbours, Chow and Su are frequently left alone in their rooms and rarely dine with the other tenants. Although they are initially polite only out of necessity, they grow closer as they realize their spouses are having an affair with each other. Chow notices that his wife owns a handbag available only overseas—one that Su's husband had purchased for her. Su, in turn, observes that her husband wears a necktie identical to one Chow owns, a gift from Chow's wife. As they piece together the truth, they begin to reenact how the affair might have started. While both accept that their spouses have betrayed them, they strive to avoid making the same mistake. Chow invites Su to help him write a martial arts serial. Their increased time together draws the attention of their neighbors, prompting Chow to rent a hotel room where they can work in private. As time passes, they acknowledge their growing feelings for each other. They continue reenacting scenes from their spouses' affair, but the emotional toll unsettles Su. They sometimes stop speaking, only to reconnect again later. When Chow receives a job offer in Singapore, he asks Su to come with him. She agrees, but arrives at the hotel too late and breaks down in his empty room. The following year, in Singapore, Chow tells a friend an old story: when someone had a secret, they would climb a mountain, carve a hollow in a tree, whisper the secret into it, and seal it with mud. Su later visits Chow's apartment in Singapore. She calls him but says nothing when he answers. Afterward, Chow notices a lipstick-stained cigarette butt in his ashtray and realizes she had been there. Three years later, Su visits Mrs. Suen, who is preparing to emigrate to the United States, and inquires about renting her old apartment. Some time afterward, Chow returns to Hong Kong to visit his former landlords, the Koos, who have moved to the Philippines. He asks about the Suen family next door, and the new owner informs him that a woman and her son now live there. Chow leaves, unaware that Su and her young son are now living in the apartment next door. During the Vietnam War, Chow travels to Cambodia and visits Angkor Wat. As a monk looks on, he whispers into a hollow in a wall and seals it with mud.",

    "plot": "Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officer Will Radford works for a government surveillance program that can monitor every person on Earth. His relationship with his pregnant daughter Faith and son Dave is strained due to his use of the program to constantly monitor them. While helping FBI agents try to find a mysterious hacker, known as \"Disruptor\", meteors begin striking all over the planet. When large machines emerge from the meteorites and start attacking humans, Will and his friend Sandra from NASA conclude it is an alien invasion. Will helps Dave and Faith evade the machines before being called to a meeting with DHS Director Donald Briggs, U.S. Secretary of Defense Walter Crystal, and the United States president. When the president authorizes a military response, other governments do likewise. Will notices the machines are concentrating around data centers around the world, dispersing smaller insectoid creatures to harvest data inside the buildings. The data nourishes the alien machines, and they continue to defeat the human forces attacking them. Will is dismayed to discover that Disruptor is actually Dave, who links him to classified information regarding a surveillance operation known as \"Goliath\". These classified files reveal to Will that alien ships had previously arrived on Earth, and that the government knew they fed on data. Despite warnings that activating Goliath could warn the aliens, Briggs activated it anyway. Will confronts Briggs, who claims his actions were necessary to keep people safe. Briggs then locks Will out of the DHS system. Will, Dave and his team of hackers re-enter the system and plant a virus to disable the aliens' machines. The virus fails to stop the aliens, who locate and kill most of Dave's fellow hackers. The military plans to bomb the DHS headquarters (under which Goliath is kept), to ensure the aliens cannot access the system. Using a variation of Faith's cancer-destroying \"Cannibal\" code concealed in a flash drive delivered by her boyfriend, Amazon delivery driver Mark, Will breaks into the bunker and shuts down Goliath in time, simultaneously deactivating the aliens. The military calls off the bombing. Will and Dave are celebrated as heroes, Briggs is arrested for his crimes and Faith is credited with using her DNA studies to ensure the aliens' defeat. Crystal gives Will an offer to lead a new surveillance program that will not interfere with people's privacy, but he declines, saying, \"Now, I'm watching you.\" He then leaves to go to Faith's baby shower.",

    "title": "Terminator 2: Judgment Day",
    "plot": "In 2029, Earth has been ravaged by the war between the malevolent artificial intelligence Skynet and the human resistance. Skynet sends the T-1000—an advanced, shape-shifting prototype Terminator made of virtually indestructible liquid metal—back in time to kill resistance leader John Connor when he is a child. To protect John, the resistance sends back a reprogrammed T-800 Terminator, a less advanced metal endoskeleton covered in living tissue. In 1995 Los Angeles, John's mother Sarah is incarcerated in Pescadero State Hospital for her violent efforts to prevent \"Judgment Day\"—the prophesied events of August 29, 1997, when Skynet will gain sentience and, in response to its creators' attempts to deactivate it, incite a nuclear holocaust. John, living with foster parents, also considers Sarah delusional and resents her efforts to prepare him for his future role. The T-1000 locates John in a shopping mall, but the T-800 intervenes, coming to John's aid and enabling his escape. John calls to warn his foster parents, but the T-800 deduces that the T-1000 has already killed them. Realizing the T-800 is programmed to obey him, John forbids it to kill people and orders it to help him rescue Sarah from the T-1000. The T-800 and John intercept Sarah as she attempts to escape. Initially horrified that the T-800 resembles the Terminator sent to kill her in 1984, she joins them and escapes the pursuing T-1000. Sarah uses the T-800's knowledge of the future to learn that a revolutionary microprocessor, being developed by Cyberdyne engineer Miles Dyson, will be crucial to Skynet's creation. Over the course of their journey, Sarah sees the T-800 serving as a friend and father figure to John, who teaches it catchphrases and hand signs while encouraging it to become more human-like. Sarah plans to escape to Mexico with John, but a nightmare about Judgment Day prompts her to decide to kill Dyson. She attacks him in his home but cannot bring herself to go through with it and relents. John arrives and reconciles with Sarah while the T-800 explains to Dyson the future consequences of his work. Dyson reveals that his research has been reverse engineered from the CPU and severed arm of the 1984 Terminator. Believing that his work must be destroyed, Dyson helps Sarah, John, and the T-800 break into Cyberdyne, retrieve the CPU and the arm, and set explosives to destroy the lab. The police assault the building and fatally shoot Dyson, but he detonates the explosives as he dies. The T-1000 pursues the surviving trio, cornering them in a steel mill. Sarah and John split up to escape while the T-1000 mangles the T-800 and briefly deactivates it by destroying its power source. The T-1000 assumes Sarah's appearance and voice to lure out John, but Sarah intervenes and, along with the reactivated T-800, pushes it into a vat of molten steel, where it disintegrates. John also throws the 1984 Terminator's arm and CPU into the vat. The T-800 explains that it must also be destroyed to prevent it from serving as a foundation for Skynet. Despite John's tearful protests, the T-800 persuades him that its destruction is the only way to protect their future. Sarah, having come to respect the T-800, shakes its hand and lowers it into the vat. The T-800 gives John a thumbs-up as it is incinerated. As Sarah drives down a highway with John, she reflects on her renewed hope for an unknown future, musing that if the T-800 could learn the value of life, so can humanity.",

    "title": "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1",
    "plot": "After being rescued from the destroyed arena in the 75th Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen, Beetee, and Finnick Odair are taken to District 13, an underground district isolated from Panem that has been spearheading the rebellion. Katniss is reunited with her mother and sister Prim and is introduced to President Alma Coin, the rebel leader. Katniss is told that her arrow destroying the forcefield led to riots in over half the districts, joining District 13 in the rebellion, which caused President Snow to bomb District 12 in retaliation. Coin asks her to become the \"Mockingjay\"—a symbol of the rebellion—as part of a \"hearts and minds\" strategy. Katniss reluctantly agrees after seeing Peeta being manipulated on state television to quell the rebellion. She visits the ruins of District 12, her old house somehow untouched with white roses from President Snow inside. Katniss meets her film team and is given Effie Trinket as a stylist and her close friend Gale as a bodyguard. They travel to District 8 where Katniss is filmed being saluted by dozens of wounded civilians at a hospital; Snow, seeing the footage, orders an airstrike at the hospital, killing everyone inside. The crew films Katniss and Gale shooting down two Capitol hovercraft and Katniss' rage-filled threatening speech, inspiring loggers in District 7 to revolt against the Capitol. Katniss and her team travel to District 12 to film her singing \"The Hanging Tree\". Rebel forces in District 5 launch an attack against a hydroelectric dam, the Capitol's primary source of electricity. The attack successfully implodes and breaches the dam, causing a blackout throughout the Capitol. That night, Katniss watches Peeta being interviewed by Caesar Flickerman, the Games' former presenter, when Coin and Beetee hijack the signal to air a clip of Katniss. After seeing it, Peeta suddenly shouts a warning that the Capitol is about to attack District 13. Coin orders a mass evacuation further into underground shelters, and the facility survives the attack. Upon emerging, Katniss discovers the area littered with white roses; she concludes that Snow orchestrated this to inform her that whenever she condemns the Capitol, they will torture Peeta in retaliation. Coin dispatches a strike team to rescue Peeta and the remaining victors Johanna Mason, Enobaria and Annie Cresta from their prison. Beetee hijacks the Capitol's defense system with a \"propo\" narrated by Finnick to convince more districts to side with the rebellion in which Finnick reveals that Snow would force \"desirable\" tributes (including Finnick himself) into prostitution with the threat of killing their families if they refused (which happened to Johanna), and that Snow only became the leader of Panem because he poisoned his opponents. When the propo proves not to be enough, Katniss communicates directly with Snow to buy enough time. Gale's team rescues the victors and escapes the Capitol easily, indicating the Capitol reduced its security on purpose. When Katniss greets Peeta, he unexpectedly attacks and nearly strangles her to death before being knocked out by Boggs. Katniss wakes up and is informed that Peeta has been \"hijacked\" — brainwashed into trying to kill her, which explains why the Capitol allowed them to escape with him. Peeta is placed in solitary confinement, while a serum is developed to reverse the hijacking effects. Coin announces that the rebels' next objective is the Capitol's principal military stronghold in District 2, the only district remaining loyal to the Capitol.",

    "title": "Transformers: Rise of the Beasts",
    "plot": "The planet-eating Transformer, Unicron, attacks the homeworld of the Maximals. Unicron sends his herald, Scourge, and the Terrorcons to obtain the Transwarp Key, which can open portals through time and space, enabling Unicron to consume planets faster. The Maximal leader Apelinq sacrifices himself to allow the other Maximals to escape the planet before Unicron devours it. The Maximal's new leader, Optimus Primal, led them to Earth with the key. In 1994 Brooklyn, Noah Diaz, an ex-military electronics expert, struggles to find a job to support his ill brother Kris and is convinced by his friend Reek to steal a Porsche to sell, only to discover that it is the Autobot Mirage in disguise. Concurrently, museum intern Elena Wallace studies an ancient statue of a falcon bearing the Maximal symbol and accidentally breaks it open to reveal the key hidden inside. The key releases an energy pulse detected by Autobot leader Optimus Prime, who summons the other Autobots, including Arcee and Bumblebee. Mirage is contacted in the middle of Noah's attempted theft, and he is roped into the Autobots' mission to recover the key so they can use it to return to their homeworld, Cybertron. Drawn by the key's signature, the Terrorcons arrive on Earth and attack the Autobots outside the museum, with Elena caught up in the conflict. Scourge kills Bumblebee, steals the key, and the Terrorcons retreat when the Maximal Airazor arrives to repel them. Airazor reveals that the Maximals have been hiding on Earth, and Scourge only has half of the Transwarp Key, which was split in two to keep it safe. Optimus insists that the key be reassembled so the Autobots can use it to return home, while Noah secretly plots to destroy the key to keep Earth safe. Elena deduces that the other half of the key is in a hidden temple in Peru. The cargo plane Autobot Stratosphere takes them to Peru, where they meet with Wheeljack, who leads them to the temple. However, the other half of the key is revealed to be no longer there. The Terrorcons attack again, and Scourge corrupts Airazor with Dark Energon. Subsequently, the Autobots meet Optimus Primal and the Maximals, who entrusted the second half of the key to a human tribe they have worked with for millennia. Scourge's corruption overtakes Airazor, whom Primal reluctantly kills at her request to save Elena. In the chaos, Noah attempts to destroy the second half of the key, but Optimus convinces him otherwise. Scourge steals it and then reassembles the two halves, erecting a tower and opening a portal above Earth for Unicron to enter. Optimus and Noah agree to work together to protect their homeworlds from Unicron. While Autobots and Maximals battle the Terrorcon army, Noah and Elena sneak in close to the Key, planning to deactivate it with an access code Elena has uncovered. During the battle, Mirage is wounded by Scourge while protecting Noah but transforms his damaged body into a powered exo-suit for Noah so they can fight together. Bumblebee is reactivated when the key activates the Energon-infused valley, and helps the Autobots and Maximals turn the tide of the battle. Optimus kills Scourge, but not before the latter damages the control console to prevent the portal from being shut down. Optimus destroys the key and collapses the portal, willing to sacrifice himself, but Noah and Primal save him from being sucked into the imploding vortex, which destroys the remaining Terrorcon army and leaves Unicron stranded. In the aftermath, the Autobots, unable to return to Cybertron, proclaim Earth as their new home and vow to continue protecting it alongside the Maximals. Elena receives recognition for discovering the temple in Peru while Noah attends an interview for a security job but finds he is actually being invited to join the secret military organization G.I. Joe, who will cover Kris's healthcare. In a mid-credits scene, Noah repairs Mirage using junk Porsche parts from Reek, who claims it is not road-worthy; Noah disproves him by calling Mirage to transform in front of Reek.",

    "plot": "Max Rockatansky is captured by cult leader Immortan Joe's War Boys and taken to his fortress called the Citadel. Max, a universal donor, is forced to transfuse his blood to Nux, a sick War Boy. Meanwhile, Joe sends his lieutenant Imperator Furiosa in the armoured \"War Rig\" to trade produce and water for petrol and ammunition with two of his allies, the Bullet Farmer and the People Eater. When Joe realises his five \"wives\" are fleeing in the Rig, he leads his entire army in pursuit, calling on his allies to help. Nux joins the pursuit with Max strapped to his car, and a chasing battle ensues. After entering enemy territory and fending off a rival gang, Furiosa drives into a sandstorm and loses all of her pursuers except Nux, who attempts to sacrifice himself to blow up the Rig. Max frees himself and restrains Nux, and Furiosa destroys Nux's car. After the sandstorm, Max catches Furiosa repairing the Rig, accompanied by Joe's \"wives\": Toast, Capable, Cheedo, the Dag, and Angharad, the latter two being pregnant with Joe's children. Max fights and subdues Furiosa, but her engine kill switch prevents him from stealing the Rig. Max begrudgingly agrees to help Furiosa's group escape Joe's wrath. Nux sneaks onto the Rig and attempts to kill Furiosa, but the women overpower him and throw Nux out. Nux rejoins Joe's army when it catches up. Furiosa drives through a canyon controlled by a biker gang, having prearranged to trade petrol for safe passage. The bikers betray her when they spot Joe's army approaching, forcing her to flee. The bikers detonate the canyon walls to block Joe and pursue the Rig as Max and Furiosa fend them off. Joe drives over the blockade in a monster truck and catches up with the Rig. He sends Nux to carjack the Rig, but Nux stumbles and drops his weapon, to Joe's disgust. While helping Max, Angharad falls off the Rig, and Joe fatally runs her over. Capable finds Nux hiding in the Rig and consoles him. At night, Furiosa and Max drive through a swamp and get stuck in the mud. They slow Joe's forces with landmines, but the Bullet Farmer continues the pursuit in his ATV. Furiosa and Max work together to blind the Bullet Farmer and disable his ATV. Moved by Capable's compassion, Nux joins the group and helps get the Rig moving again. In the morning, Furiosa tells Max that her group is escaping to a \"Green Place\", the bountiful land where she grew up before being kidnapped and brought to the Citadel. She spots a Green Place watchtower and identifies herself to the woman at top who summons their matriarchal clan called the Vuvalini. The Vuvalini recognise Furiosa as one of their own but inform a devastated Furiosa that the Green Place was the now-uninhabitable swamp from the previous night and that only seven Vuvalini are left. The group decides to ride across an immense salt flat, hoping to find a new home on the other side. Max goes his own way. After seeing a vision of the child he was unable to save, Max catches up with the group and convinces them to return to the Citadel since they do not know what lies beyond the salt flat, but do know that the now-undefended Citadel has ample water and crops. Joe intercepts them, and in the ensuing battle, five Vuvalini are killed, Toast is captured, and Furiosa is severely wounded. Joe overtakes the Rig as they approach the canyon. While Max fights Joe's son and enforcer Rictus, Furiosa boards Joe's truck to rescue Toast, who distracts Joe, allowing Furiosa to kill him. The remnants of the group drive Joe's truck back to the Citadel, while Nux sacrifices himself by wrecking the Rig to block the canyon behind them, killing Rictus. Max transfuses his blood to Furiosa, saving her life. Back at the Citadel, the people rejoice upon learning of Joe's death. As Max's companions are lifted to Joe's cliffside fortress, Max and Furiosa glance at each other before Max disappears into the crowd.",

    "title": "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever",
    "plot": "T'Challa, king of Wakanda, is suffering from a terminal illness which his sister Shuri believes can be cured by the \"heart-shaped herb\". Shuri attempts to synthetically recreate the herb after it was burned by Erik \"Killmonger\" Stevens, but fails to do so before T'Challa dies. A year later, Wakanda faces pressure from other nations to share their vibranium, with attempts to steal it by force. Queen Ramonda urges Shuri to continue her herb research to create a new Black Panther, but Shuri refuses, believing the Black Panther is no longer needed. In the Atlantic, a U.S. expedition team uses a vibranium detector to find a deposit underwater, but a group of blue-skinned, water-breathing superhumans led by Namor kills them. The CIA suspects it was Wakanda's involvement. Namor confronts Ramonda and Shuri after bypassing Wakanda's security. He blames Wakanda for the vibranium race and gives them an ultimatum: hand over the scientist who created the detector or he will attack Wakanda. Shuri and Okoye learn from CIA agent Everett K. Ross that the scientist is MIT student Riri Williams. They confront her at the university before being pursued by the FBI and Namor's warriors, who defeat Okoye and take Shuri and Williams underwater to meet Namor. Angered by Okoye's failure to protect Shuri, Ramonda strips her of her title as general of the Dora Milaje and seeks out Nakia, who has been living in Haiti since The Blip. Namor shows Shuri his vibranium-rich underwater kingdom of Talokan, protected for centuries from the surface world. Bitter at the surface world for the slavery and genocide of his people, Namor proposes an alliance with Wakanda against the rest of the world, threatening destruction if they refuse. Nakia helps Shuri and Williams escape, accidentally killing two Talokanil guards. Namor retaliates with an attack on Wakanda, during which Ramonda drowns while saving Williams. Namor vows to return with his army, and Wakanda's citizens relocate to the Jabari mountains for their safety. Meanwhile, Ross is arrested by his ex-wife, CIA director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, for secretly exchanging classified intelligence with Wakandans. After Ramonda's funeral, Shuri uses a remnant of the herb that gave Namor's people their superhuman abilities to reconstruct the heart-shaped herb. She ingests it, gaining superhuman abilities and meeting Killmonger in the Ancestral Plane, who questions if she will seek revenge or be as honorable as T'Challa. Shuri dons a new Black Panther suit and is accepted by the other Wakandan tribes as the Black Panther. Despite M'Baku's urges for peace, Shuri is determined to exact vengeance on Namor for Ramonda's death and orders an immediate counterattack on Talokan. Preparing for battle, with Ayo assuming the position of general of the Dora Milaje, Shuri bestows the Midnight Angel armor upon Okoye, who in turn recruits Dora Milaje member Aneka to join her. Williams creates an Iron Man-esque powered exoskeleton to aid the Wakandans. The Wakandans use a seafaring vessel to lure Namor and his warriors to the surface with a vibranium detector as battle ensues. Shuri traps Namor in a fighter aircraft, aiming to weaken him. They crash on a desert beach and fight. Shuri gains the upper hand but sees a vision of Ramonda, urging Namor to yield and offering a peaceful alliance. Namor agrees, ending the battle. His cousin, Namora, is upset by the surrender, but he believes the alliance will strengthen Talokan. Williams returns to MIT, leaving her suit behind, while Okoye rescues Ross. Shuri plants more heart-shaped herbs to ensure the Black Panther mantle's future. In her absence, M'Baku challenges for the throne. Shuri visits Nakia in Haiti and burns her funeral robe to finally grieve for T'Challa, honoring Ramonda's wishes. In a mid-credits scene, Shuri learns that Nakia and T'Challa had a son named Toussaint, whom Nakia has been raising in secret. Toussaint reveals his Wakandan name is T'Challa.",

    "title": "Jurassic World Dominion",
    "plot": "Four years after the Lockwood Estate incident that followed the volcanic eruption of Isla Nublar, once-extinct dinosaurs freely roam the Earth, breeding exponentially. Amid global efforts to control them, Biosyn Genetics establishes a dinosaur preserve in Italy's Dolomites and conducts genomics research, ostensibly for pharmacological applications. Claire Dearing, Zia Rodriguez, and Franklin Webb investigate illegal dinosaur breeding sites, also gathering proof of cases of animal cruelty. Claire's partner, Owen Grady, helps relocate stray dinosaurs. At their remote cabin in the Sierra Nevada mountains, Claire and Owen secretly raise 14-year-old Maisie Lockwood (Benjamin Lockwood's biogenetic granddaughter) and protect her from groups seeking to exploit her unique genetic makeup. When Blue, the last of the Velociraptors Owen raised and trained, arrives at the cabin with an asexually-reproduced hatchling, Maisie names it Beta. Increasingly frustrated living in seclusion, Maisie sneaks away to explore. Mercenaries searching for Maisie find and kidnap her and capture Beta. Meanwhile, swarms of giant locusts are devastating U.S. crops. Dr. Ellie Sattler observes that crops grown with Biosyn seeds are left uneaten, raising suspicions that Biosyn created the insects. She takes a locust obtained from West Texas to her former romantic partner, paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant and reveals she is now divorced from her husband Mark. They determine the locust was genetically engineered with Cretaceous-period and contemporary DNA. Franklin, now with the CIA's dangerous-species division, discloses to Claire and Owen that the mercenaries are at Malta. Upon arrival there, they infiltrate a dinosaur black market with Owen's former Jurassic World colleague Barry Sembène, who is leading a French Intelligence raid. Carnivorous dinosaurs are unleashed during the foray, wreaking havoc. When Claire and Owen learn that Maisie and Beta were transported to the Biosyn facility, sympathetic cargo pilot Kayla Watts agrees to fly them there. Chaotician Dr. Ian Malcolm now works for Biosyn. He sought Ellie's help to expose CEO Dr. Lewis Dodgson after communications director Ramsay Cole warned him of Dodgson's illegal activities. Dodgson is exploiting dinosaurs and coerces former InGen geneticist Dr. Henry Wu to modify the transgenic locust to let Biosyn corner the world's food supply. Wu denounces the plan, warning it will cause an ecological collapse as the locusts spread unchecked. Wu meets Maisie and explains that his former colleague, Dr. Charlotte Lockwood (Benjamin Lockwood's deceased daughter), used her own DNA to replicate and give birth to the genetically identical Maisie. Charlotte also altered Maisie's DNA to prevent her from inheriting the fatal disease that would later kill Charlotte by injecting Maisie with a pathogen she engineered. Wu believes that Maisie and Beta's asexual conception and DNA are key to recreate Charlotte's pathogen to halt the locust outbreak. A Quetzalcoatlus attacks Kayla's plane in Biosyn's airspace, forcing Owen and Kayla to crash land while Claire is ejected. After separate dinosaur encounters, the three regroup. Inside Biosyn, Ian and Ramsay covertly advise Ellie and Alan on where to obtain a locust DNA sample. While searching for the lab, they encounter Maisie. Discovering the breach, Dodgson attempts to incinerate the locusts to destroy evidence; some locusts escape through an air vent while ablaze, sparking a wildfire around the preserve. Alan, Ellie, and Maisie barely escape the facility before finding Ian. They meet Owen, Claire and Kayla, with Ramsay later joining them. Dodgson flees with dinosaur embryos via a hyperloop, but becomes trapped after Claire and Ellie reroute the power and is then killed by a trio of Dilophosaurus. As the group works together, Owen, with Alan and Maisie's help, captures Beta. They and Wu escape in a Biosyn helicopter amidst a fight between a Giganotosaurus and Isla Nublar's former resident Tyrannosaurus, the latter assisted by a Therizinosaurus. Ellie and Alan rekindle their romantic relationship before testifying with Ian and Ramsay against Biosyn. Owen, Claire and Maisie return home and reunite Beta and Blue. Wu releases a host locust carrying the pathogen, gradually eradicating the swarms. Dinosaurs and humans adapt to a new co-existence, and the United Nations declares Biosyn Valley an international dinosaur sanctuary.",

Meanwhile, Reed and his fiancée, Susan Storm, who have been preparing for their upcoming wedding, consider ending their activities with the Fantastic Four. Reed and Susan's wedding ceremony is interrupted by the phenomenon approaches New York City ; Johnny Storm pursues it, discovering it to be a humanoid alien on a flying surfboard - the Silver Surfer. Johnny confronts the Surfer, who overpowers him; he is later examined by Reed, who discovers that his exposure to the Surfer has set Johnny's molecular structure in passive flux, allowing him to switch super powers with the others through physical contact. Reed traces cosmic energy of the Surfer, discovering a series of planets the Surfer visited previously that have all been destroyed, and determining it will strike next in London. The Four travel there too late to stop the Surfer creating another crater, which drains the River Thames. Meanwhile, the Surfer also passes over Latveria, reviving Victor Von Doom, who then confronts the Surfer in the Russell Glacier; the Surfer defeats Doom, but in doing so restores Doom's human form. Doom leverages his experience with the Surfer over the US military, who force the Four to work with him. Deducing that the Surfer's board is the source of his power, Reed develops a pulse generator that will separate him from it. They track the Surfer to the Black Forest, where he informs Susan that he is not the one trying to destroy Earth before the pulse is activated, separating the Surfer from his board. The weakened Surfer is imprisoned by the military in Siberia and tortured. Susan sneaks into the Surfer's cell, where she learns he is serving Galactus, a giant cosmic entity that feeds on life-bearing planets. His service to Galactus is what prevents his own world from being destroyed, and that the Surfer's board is a homing beacon leading Galactus to Earth. Doom steals the Surfer's board and uses it to escape to China; the Four free the Surfer and pursue Doom in the Fantasticar, confronting him in Shanghai, where he impales Sue. With the Surfer powerless, Johnny absorbs the combined powers of the team to battle Doom and, with the assistance of Ben Grimm, defeats him and retrieves the board. As Galactus approaches Earth, the Surfer regains control of his board and, inspired by Sue's humanity, revives her and vows to end Galactus' destructive path. With help from Johnny, the Surfer flies into the stratosphere and confronts Galactus, where a massive blast of energy engulfs them both. Johnny's second exposure to the Surfer leaves him no longer able to switch powers. Reed and Sue decide they no longer want to leave the Fantastic Four for a normal life and are then married in Japan, before they and Johnny and Ben are summoned to an emergency in Venice. In a mid-credits scene, the lifeless Silver Surfer floats through space, until his eyes open and his board flies back to him.",

    "title": "The Terminator",
    "plot": "An android assassin called a \"Terminator\" is sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 Los Angeles. It resembles a human male and is programmed to hunt and assassinate a woman named Sarah Connor. Separately, a human soldier named Kyle Reese simultaneously arrives, intent on stopping the Terminator. After searching for addresses in a telephone directory, the Terminator systematically dispatches similarly-named women, as well as several other people it comes in close contact with, including Sarah's roommate, Ginger, and her boyfriend, Matt. The Terminator eventually locates the correct Sarah at a local nightclub, where she is rescued by Reese during a mass shooting. The pair then steal a car to escape, with the Terminator pursuing them in a stolen police car. As they hide in a parking lot, Reese explains to Sarah that an artificially intelligent defense network known as Skynet, created by Cyberdyne Systems, will soon become self-aware and trigger a global nuclear war to bring humankind to its extinction. Sarah's future son, John, will rally the survivors and lead a successful resistance movement against Skynet and its mechanical forces. On the verge of the resistance's victory, Skynet sent the Terminator back in time to assassinate Sarah, thereby preventing John's birth. Reese additionally divulges that the Terminator has a perfect voice-mimicking ability and a durable metal endoskeleton covered by living tissue to appear human. The Terminator tracks Reese and Sarah, but it disappears after crashing during a car chase with the duo. The police apprehend Reese and Sarah. Sarah is notified of Ginger and Matt's murder, while Reese is interrogated by Dr. Silberman, a skeptical criminal psychologist. The Terminator returns to a motel room it has been using as a base of operations to perform self-repairs on its damaged eye and right arm. It arrives at the police station searching for Sarah, slaughtering many officers in the process. Reese and Sarah escape, steal another car and take refuge in a motel, where they assemble several pipe bombs and plan their next move. Reese admits that he has adored Sarah since he saw her in a photograph that John gave him, and that he travelled through time out of love for her. Reciprocating his feelings, Sarah kisses him and they have sex. The Terminator locates Sarah by intercepting a call intended for her mother. She and Reese escape the motel in a pickup truck while it pursues them on a motorcycle. In the ensuing chase, Reese is badly wounded by gunfire while throwing pipe bombs at the Terminator. Sarah knocks the Terminator off its motorcycle but loses control of the truck, which flips over. The Terminator, now bloodied and badly damaged, hijacks a tank truck and attempts to run down Sarah. Reese manages to insert a pipe bomb into the truck's hose tube, causing it to explode and reduce the Terminator to its endoskeleton. It pursues them into a Cyberdyne-owned factory, where Reese activates machinery to distract it, but it eventually discovers them. Reese then lodges his final pipe bomb into its midsection, blowing it apart, but at the cost of his own life. Its still-functional torso then pursues Sarah, but she manages to lure it into a hydraulic press that she uses to crush it, finally destroying the cyborg. Months later, Sarah, now pregnant with John, travels through Mexico, recording audio tapes to pass on to him. At a gas station, a boy takes an instant film photograph of her, the exact one that John will one day give to Reese, and she purchases it. The gas station owner remarks that a storm is coming and she indicates her awareness, alluding to humanity's impending conflict against Skynet, before driving away towards it.",

    "plot": "In 5000 BC, ten superpowered beings known as Eternals—Ajak, Sersi, Ikaris, Kingo, Sprite, Phastos, Makkari, Druig, Gilgamesh, and Thena—are sent to Earth by Arishem, a Celestial, on the starship Domo. They are charged with exterminating invasive entities known as the Deviants. After the last Deviants are killed in 1521, the group's opinions differ over their continued relationship with humankind. Over the next 500 years, they mostly live apart, waiting for Arishem's orders. In the present, Sersi and Sprite live together in London. After Sersi's partner Ikaris left her without explanation centuries earlier, she is now in a relationship with human Dane Whitman who works at the Natural History Museum. When the trio is attacked by the Deviant Kro, Ikaris arrives and chases the creature away. The three Eternals travel to South Dakota to reunite with their leader, Ajak, only to find her dead. Sersi is posthumously chosen by Ajak as her successor, granting her the ability to communicate with Arishem. Sersi learns that the Eternals' mission was actually to prepare Earth for the Emergence of a new Celestial. Arishem explains that, for millions of years, he has been planting Celestial seeds inside planets where the energy from large populations allows new Celestials to be born. The Deviants were sent to destroy the apex predators of each planet to ensure the development of intelligent life, but when they evolved and began hunting the planets' native populations, Arishem created the Eternals to counter them. With the recent end of the Blip restoring Earth's population, humankind has reached the necessary size to allow the Celestial Tiamut to be born, which will result in Earth's destruction. Hoping to delay the Emergence, the Eternals reunite. At Druig's residence in the Amazon rainforest, they are attacked by the Deviants. They kill them all except for Kro, who kills Gilgamesh before fleeing. Phastos proposes they use the Uni-Mind, a connection between all the Eternals that would give Druig enough power to put Tiamut to sleep with his mind-control abilities. However, Ikaris is loyal to Arishem and refuses to help stop the Emergence. He reveals that Ajak wanted to stop the Emergence and save humanity, so he led her to the Deviants and allowed them to kill her. Sprite joins Ikaris due to her unrequited love for him while Kingo chooses to leave, agreeing with Ikaris but not wanting to hurt his friends. Makkari locates the place of the Emergence, an active volcano in the Indian Ocean, where Ikaris and Sprite attempt to stop them. Druig knocks out Sprite, and Phastos restrains Ikaris. Kro arrives and is killed by Thena. Druig is unable to put Tiamut to sleep, and Sersi instead attempts to turn him into stone. Ikaris breaks free of his restraints and goes to kill Sersi, but is unable to due to his love for her. Both he and Sprite join with the others in the Uni-Mind, and Sersi gains enough power to turn Tiamut into stone. Guilt-ridden, Ikaris flies into the Sun. Sersi uses the remaining Uni-Mind energy to turn Sprite into a human, ending her permanent childlike state. Thena, Druig, and Makkari depart on the Domo to warn Eternals on other planets of the Emergences. Whitman professes his love for Sersi and is about to reveal a secret about his family history when she, Phastos, and Kingo are lifted into space by Arishem. Displeased with their treason, Arishem says he will spare humanity if the Eternals' memories show that humans are worthy of living. He vows to return for judgment and takes the trio into a singularity. In a mid-credits scene, Thena, Makkari, and Druig meet the Eternal Eros and his assistant Pip the Troll. In a post-credits scene, an unseen person questions whether Whitman is ready to wield the Ebony Blade.",

    "title": "Blade Runner 2049",
    "plot": "In 2049 Los Angeles, bioengineered humans known as replicants are still used for slave labor. K (short for serial number, KD6-3.7), a Nexus-9 replicant, works for the Los Angeles Police Department as a \"blade runner\", an officer who hunts and \"retires\" (kills) rogue replicant models. After \"retiring\" (killing) replicant Sapper Morton, K finds a box buried under a tree at Morton's farm. It contained the remains of a female replicant who died during a caesarean section. This demonstrates that replicants could reproduce biologically, previously thought impossible. K's superior, Lt. Joshi, or \"Madam,\" fears this knowledge will lead to war between humans and replicants, so orders K to retire the replicant child and destroy all related evidence. K visits the Wallace Corporation, successor to the defunct Tyrell Corporation in the manufacture of replicants. DNA archives identify the deceased female as an experimental Nexus 7 replicant. K learns of her romantic ties with former blade runner Rick Deckard. CEO Niander Wallace wants the secret to replicant reproduction to expand interstellar colonization. He sends his replicant enforcer, Luv, to monitor K. An unidentified figure engages several prostitutes in the city, including one named Mariette, to keep eyes on K. At Morton's farm, K finds the date 6.10.21 carved into the tree trunk and recognizes it from a childhood memory of a wooden toy horse. Because replicant memories are artificial, K's holographic A.I. girlfriend Joi suggests that this is evidence that K was born, not created. K discovers in LAPD records that two children born on that date have identical DNA, but are inexplicably registered as being opposite genders, and that the girl died from a genetic disorder. K's search for the boy leads him to an orphanage, but the records from the year in question are missing. K recognizes the orphanage from his memories and finds the toy horse in the furnace where he remembers hiding it. He then visits replicant-memory-maker Dr. Ana Stelline, who confirms that his memory of the orphanage is a real memory that someone lived, leading K to conclude he is the deceased replicant woman's son. K then fails a baseline test, marking him as rogue. When he implies to Joshi that he killed the replicant child, she gives him 48 hours to pass the test, or he will be retired himself. Joi hires prostitute replicant Mariette to sync with to be able to have physical intimacy with K. The following morning, Mariette places a tracker in K's jacket prior to leaving. K then takes the wooden toy horse to be analyzed for its origin, which leads him to the ruins of a now radioactive Las Vegas. There he finds Deckard, who informs him that the deceased replicant woman was named Rachael, and that he is the father of Rachael's child. Deckard had helped the Replicant Freedom Movement scramble the birth records to protect the child's identity. Deckard then left the child with the Replicant Freedom Movement to ensure the hunted child would not be found through him. Luv, who has killed Joshi, tracks K to Las Vegas. She kidnaps Deckard, destroys Joi, and leaves an injured K behind. Using Mariette's tracker, the Replicant Freedom Movement rescues K. Their leader, Freysa, reveals that Rachael's child was actually a girl, and, fearing that Deckard may give up the freedom movement to Wallace, thereby endangering the child, Freysa urges K to kill him. Knowing now that the child was a girl, K deduces that Dr. Stelline is Rachael's daughter, and that the toy horse memory is actually Dr. Stelline's. Luv takes Deckard to meet Wallace, who offers Deckard a duplicate Rachael in exchange for information about his child's whereabouts. He refuses, and points out a physical error in the duplicate, so Luv kills the duplicate. As Luv transports Deckard to be tortured off-world, K intercedes. He fights and drowns Luv but is severely wounded in the process. K tells Deckard that he will be presumed dead, and is now free to go to his daughter, and then takes him to Dr. Stelline's facility. Standing outside the facility, he hands Deckard the toy horse. Deckard enters the building and meets Dr. Stelline as K bleeds out on the steps in front.",

    "title": "War of the Worlds",
    "plot": "A narrator opens the film stating that extraterrestrials with immense intelligence have grown envious of humanity's dominion of Earth and are plotting against them. Divorced longshoreman Ray Ferrier works as a crane operator at a dock in Brooklyn, New York and is estranged from his children, 10-year-old daughter Rachel and his teenage son Robbie. Ray's pregnant ex-wife, Mary Ann, drops the two off at his house in Bayonne, New Jersey on her way to visit her parents in Boston, Massachusetts. Later, a strange thunderstorm occurs, during which lightning strikes multiple times into the middle of a nearby intersection, causing an EMP that instantly disables almost all electronic devices. On his way to investigate the impacts, Ray suggests his mechanic friend Manny repair a customer's minivan by replacing a solenoid. He joins the crowd at the scene of the impacts, where a massive \"tripod\" war machine emerges from the ground following an earthquake and attacks the crowd using energy weapons to disintegrate most of the witnesses into ash. Ray collects his children and commandeers the van Manny has repaired; he attempts to persuade Manny to join them but is forced to leave him behind when the tripod attacks, resulting in Manny's death. Ray drives his children to Mary Ann's empty suburban New Jersey home to take refuge. Later, a Boeing 747 crashes into the neighborhood. Ray meets a wandering TV news team scavenging the wreckage for food, upon which a correspondent reveals that many tripods have attacked major cities around the world and that they have force shields that protect them from humanity's defenses. She adds that the tripods' pilots traveled to Earth within the lightning storms to enter their machines, presumed to have been buried underground long ago. Ray transports his children to Boston to be with their mother, but a desperate mob swarms their vehicle, forcing them to abandon it. They eventually get on a ferry crossing over the Hudson River before tripods attack the refugees. One tripod emerges from the water and capsizes the ferry, forcing Ray and his kids to swim to shore while the tripods abduct several refugees. They then witness a US military counter-offensive against the tripods. To Ray's dismay, Robbie joins the futile fight out of hatred for the invaders, leaving Ray and Rachel to flee. The military forces are obliterated, with Robbie presumed dead along with them. Shortly afterward, the pair are offered shelter in a nearby house by a former ambulance driver, Harlan Ogilvy. The three remain undetected for several hours, even as a tripod's probe and a group of aliens explore the basement. Tensions soon arise between Harlan and Ray, with Harlan insistent on fighting and killing the aliens while Ray prefers hiding with Rachel to avoid being spotted and killed by the aliens. They soon discover that the aliens have started cultivating a red-colored vegetation across the landscape that is quickly spreading. Later, Harlan suffers a mental breakdown after witnessing the tripods harvesting human blood and tissue to fertilize the alien vegetation. Fearing that his mad shouting will alert the aliens, Ray reluctantly kills him. Later in the night, a second tripod probe then catches the Ferriers sleeping, causing Rachel to flee outside only to be abducted by the tripod. Chasing after the tripod, Ray grabs a belt of grenades from an overgrown Humvee, then intentionally allows himself to be abducted. With the help of other abductees, Ray destroys the tripod from within with the grenades. Ray and Rachel eventually reach Boston, where they find the alien vegetation withering and the tripods inexplicably collapsing. When another tripod appears, active yet unstable, Ray notices birds landing on it, indicating that its force shields have been disabled. He alerts the soldiers escorting the fleeing crowd, who shoot it down with Javelin missiles. As the soldiers advance on the downed tripod, a hatch opens, and a pale, sickly alien struggles halfway out before dying. Ray and Rachel finally approach Mary Ann's parents' house, reuniting with Mary Ann and Robbie, who survived. In closing, the narrator explains that the aliens died because they were vulnerable to the countless microbes inhabiting the Earth that humanity has adapted to for millennia.",

    "plot": "While exploring space for new habitable worlds, a probe belonging to the bio-engineering corporation Life Foundation discovers a comet covered in symbiotic lifeforms. The probe returns to Earth with four samples, but one escapes and causes the ship to crash in Miri. The Life Foundation recovers the other three and transports them to their research facility in San Francisco, where they discover that the symbiotes cannot survive without oxygen-breathing hosts, which often fatally reject the symbiosis. Investigative journalist Eddie Brock reads about these human trials in a classified document in the possession of his fiancée Anne Weying, an attorney preparing a lawsuit defense for the Life Foundation. Eddie confronts Life Foundation CEO Carlton Drake about the trials, leading to Eddie and Anne both losing their jobs. Consequently, Anne ends her relationship and engagement with Eddie. Six months later, Drake's symbiosis trials are closer to success, although one of his symbiotes dies due to carelessness. Eddie is approached by Dora Skirth, one of Drake's scientists, who disagrees with his methods and wants to expose him. She helps Eddie break into the research facility to search for evidence, and he learns that an acquaintance of his, a homeless woman named Maria, is one of the test subjects. Eddie attempts to rescue Maria, but the symbiote possessing her transfers to his body without him realizing, leaving her dead. Eddie escapes and soon begins displaying strange symptoms. He reaches out to Anne for help, and her new boyfriend, Dr. Dan Lewis, discovers the symbiote on examining Eddie. Drake exposes Skirth to the remaining captive symbiote, killing both. This leaves the symbiote inside Eddie as the only known surviving specimen. Drake sends mercenaries to retrieve the symbiote from Eddie, but it manifests around his body as a monstrous creature that fights off the attackers. It later introduces itself to Eddie as Venom and explains that the comet is searching for worlds where the symbiotes can possess and devour the inhabitants. Venom offers to spare Eddie if he helps the symbiotes achieve their goal, and Eddie uses the superhuman attributes that the symbiote imbues him with. Eddie breaks into his old workplace to turn in evidence of Drake's crimes but is surrounded by SWAT officers. Anne sees him transform to escape and takes Eddie to Dan's office, where they explain that the symbiote is rotting Eddie's internal organs. Eddie notes that the symbiote has two weaknesses: high-pitched noises and fire. Although Venom claims the organ damage can be reversed, Anne uses an MRI machine to separate him from Eddie, whom Drake's men then capture. Meanwhile, the fourth symbiote, Riot, makes its way from Malaysia to San Francisco by hopping from body to body. It bonds with Drake, who agrees to take Riot in a Life Foundation space probe to collect the rest of the symbiotes and bring them to Earth. Anne reluctantly bonds with Venom so they can free Eddie. When Eddie and Venom are bonded again, the latter promises that it has been convinced to help protect the Earth from his kind through its interactions with Eddie, and the pair attempt to stop Riot and Drake with Anne's help. After a lengthy battle, Venom damages the probe as it takes off, causing it to explode and kill both Riot and Drake. After the incident, Eddie returns to journalism, while Anne believes Eddie is no longer bonded to Venom after this, and that Venom also died in the explosion. However, the pair remain secretly bonded and set out to protect San Francisco by devouring criminals. In a mid-credits scene, Eddie is invited to interview incarcerated serial killer Cletus Kasady, who promises \"carnage\" when he escapes.",

    "title": "Pacific Rim",
    "plot": "In 2013, massive alien monsters called Kaiju emerge from an interdimensional portal (the Breach) at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean and begin to attack various coastal cities. They prove resistant to conventional military force, prompting humanity to construct massive mecha called Jaegers; each is co-piloted by two or more people who share the mental stress of piloting the machine through a mental link called the Drift. The machines initially prove highly effective, ushering in a new era of Jaeger stardom. In 2020, brothers Yancy and Raleigh Becket pilot American Jaeger Gipsy Danger to defend Anchorage from a Category-3 Kaiju codenamed Knifehead. The Kaiju severely damages Gipsy, leading to Yancy's death. Raleigh kills Knifehead and pilots Gipsy to shore alone before collapsing. Traumatized by his brother's death and the stress of solo-piloting the Jaeger, he quits the program. Five years later, world leaders divert funding from the Jaeger program in favor of coastal defense walls due to resurgent Kaiju attacks and the rapid attrition of Jaegers. However, the walls are soon proven ineffective when a Kaiju breaks through the wall in Sydney in less than one hour before being brought down by Australian Jaeger Striker Eureka, piloted by father-son duo Herc and Chuck Hansen. The remaining Jaegers are relocated to Hong Kong under Marshal Stacker Pentecost. Now working in wall construction, Raleigh is recruited by Pentecost and brought to Hong Kong. There, he meets Mako Mori, director of the Jaeger restoration program. Four Jaegers remain: refurbished Gipsy Danger, Russian Cherno Alpha, Chinese Crimson Typhoon, and Striker Eureka. Pentecost informs Raleigh of his plan to destroy the Breach by detonating a tactical nuclear weapon, to be escorted by Raleigh in Gipsy; Raleigh searches for a new co-pilot and finds Mako is compatible. During their first test in Gipsy Danger, Mako loses alignment while recalling a Kaiju attack in Tokyo, nearly discharging Gipsy's plasma cannon inside the Shatterdome. Consequently, Pentecost suspends Mako. Raleigh protests, having seen through Mako's memories that Pentecost had adopted and raised Mako after her parents died in the Kaiju attack, and suggests the real reason for Pentecost suspending Mako was to protect her. Pentecost remains unswayed. Pentecost consults Kaiju experts Newton Geiszler and Hermann Gottlieb. Hermann predicts that while Kaiju attacks will increase in frequency, the Breach will soon be stable enough to permit passage of the bomb. Disregarding Pentecost's advice, Newton drifts with a Kaiju's brain, learning that they are a hive mind of bioweapons created by an alien race, the Precursors, for the colonization of Earth. At Pentecost's instruction, Newton meets with black market dealer Hannibal Chau for another Kaiju brain to drift with. During the meeting, two Category-4 Kaiju, Leatherback and Otachi, attack the city; Hannibal deduces that the hive mind accessed Newton's memories during the drift, which prompted the two Kaiju to attack Hong Kong in search of him. All Jaegers except Gipsy Danger intervene. Otachi destroys Crimson Typhoon while Leatherback annihilates Cherno Alpha and disables Striker Eureka with an EMP blast, injuring Herc. The nuclear-powered Gipsy, with Mako reinstated, eliminates both Kaiju before Newton is harmed. Meanwhile, Newton and Hannibal attempt to harvest Otachi's secondary brain but find she is pregnant; the infant Kaiju bursts out, devouring Hannibal before strangling itself with its umbilical cord. Newton and Hermann drift with the infant's brain, discovering that the Breach only opens if it detects Kaiju DNA. Pentecost reveals to Raleigh he has radiation poisoning after piloting a first-generation Jaeger to save a young Mako, and that piloting again would prove fatal. With Herc injured, he nevertheless resolves to co-pilot Striker in his stead. When two new Kaiju, Scunner and Raiju, are detected at the Breach, Gipsy and Striker approach, where the first-ever Category-5 Kaiju, Slattern, appears. Gipsy kills Raiju, but is damaged. Pentecost and Chuck sacrifice themselves by detonating their nuclear warhead, killing Scunner and allowing Gipsy to defeat Slattern and ride its corpse into the Breach. Raleigh ejects Mako from Gipsy, triggers a meltdown in the Jaeger's nuclear reactor, and ejects before its detonation seals the Breach. Their escape pods surface as rescue helicopters arrive, and humanity celebrates the defeat of the Kaiju. In a post-credit scene, Hannibal can be seen cutting his way out of the infant kaiju that swallowed him, complaining about his missing shoe.",

Just before the planet implodes, Krypton's top scientist, Jor-El, steals and infuses the genetics codex into his new-born son, Kal-El, the first naturally born Kryptonian in centuries. Jor-El, with the help of his wife Lara, manages to send Kal-El in a spacecraft toward Earth before he is killed by General Zod during a coup d'état. Kal-El lands in Kansas, where he is adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent and named Clark. As he grows older, due to his Kryptonian physiology and Earth's yellow sun, he develops superhuman powers that Jonathan urges him to keep hidden, even refusing Clark's help years later during a tornado storm in which he dies. Burdened with guilt over Jonathan's death, Clark travels the globe hiding under various aliases seeking a purpose in life. Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane receives an assignment to investigate the discovery of a Kryptonian scout ship in the Arctic. Clark enters the ship disguised as a worker and learns from its artificial intelligence modeled after his father Jor-El about his origins, and that Clark was sent to Earth to help guide its people. While following Clark, Lois inadvertently triggers the ship's security system. Clark uses his powers to rescue her from its defenses. He wears a uniform provided by the ship's AI and begins testing his abilities. Unable to convince supervisor Perry White to publish an article on the incident, Lois tracks down Clark in Smallville, with the intent of exposing him. However, Lois drops the story upon hearing of Jonathan Kent's sacrifice, keeping Clark's identity safe while fueling Perry's suspicions. Zod and his crew escape the Phantom Zone, where they were imprisoned for treason for their actions against Krypton. They travel to Earth to turn it into a new Krypton, possessing several terraforming devices salvaged from Kryptonian outposts. Following Clark and Lois' capture, Zod's science officer, Jax-Ur, extracts some of Clark's genes so as to create new Kryptonians who will build a society based on Zod's ideals of genetic purity. Using the Jor-El AI to take over the ship, Clark and Lois flee and warn the U.S. military of Zod's plan, resulting in a confrontation between Clark and Zod's troops. Zod deploys his most powerful terraforming device, the World Engine, which severely damages Metropolis and risks humanity's extinction. Clark, now dubbed as \"Superman,\" destroys the terraforming platform while the military launches an attack on the Black Zero, sending Zod's troops back to the Phantom Zone. With the ship destroyed and Krypton's only hope of revival gone, Zod vows to destroy Earth and its inhabitants out of revenge. The two Kryptonians engage in a lengthy battle across Metropolis, which concludes when Superman is forced to kill Zod as he attacks a family trapped in a train station. Sometime later, Superman persuades the government to let him act independently, under the condition he does not turn against humanity. To gain covert access to dangerous situations, he takes a job under his civilian identity, Clark Kent, as a reporter for the Daily Planet.",

    "title": "Everything Everywhere All at Once",
    "plot": "Evelyn Quan Wang is a middle-aged Chinese immigrant who runs a laundromat with her husband, Waymond. Two decades earlier, they eloped to the United States and had a daughter, Joy. In the present day, Evelyn is enduring multiple struggles: the laundromat is being audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); Waymond is attempting to serve her with divorce papers in an effort to spark a discussion about their marriage; her rigorous father (referred to as Gong Gong, Cantonese for grandfather) is visiting for her Chinese New Year party; and she has a strained relationship with Joy, who is battling depression and has a non-Chinese girlfriend, Becky, whom Evelyn is reluctant to accept. At a tense meeting with IRS Revenue Agent Deirdre Beaubeirdre, Waymond's body is taken over by Alpha-Waymond, a version of Waymond from the \"Alphaverse.\" Alpha-Waymond explains to Evelyn that many parallel universes exist (the \"multiverse\") because every life choice creates a new alternative universe. In the Alphaverse, the now-deceased Alpha-Evelyn developed \"verse-jumping\" technology, which enables people to access the skills, memories, and bodies of their parallel selves by performing bizarre actions that are statistically unlikely. The multiverse is threatened by Jobu Tupaki, the Alpha-Joy whose mind was splintered after Alpha-Evelyn pushed her to verse-jump beyond her endurance. Jobu experiences all universes at once and can verse-jump and manipulate matter at will. Jobu has created a black hole-like \"Everything Bagel\" that forms a toroid singularity that could destroy the multiverse. Evelyn is provided verse-jumping technology to fight Jobu's minions, who are converging on the IRS building. She uncovers other universes in which she made different choices and flourished, such as becoming a kung fu master and film star. She also learns that Waymond intends to file for divorce. Alpha-Waymond believes that Evelyn, as the greatest \"failure\" of all Evelyns in the multiverse, possesses the untapped potential needed to defeat Jobu. Gong Gong is taken over by Alpha-Gong Gong, who instructs Evelyn to kill Joy to prevent Jobu from using her to access Evelyn's universe. Evelyn refuses and decides to face Jobu by acquiring powers through repeated verse-jumping. Alpha-Gong Gong, convinced that Evelyn's mind has been compromised like Jobu's, sends soldiers after Evelyn. While they fight, Jobu locates and kills Alpha-Waymond in the Alphaverse. As Jobu confronts Evelyn in her universe, Evelyn's mind begins to splinter, causing her to collapse. Evelyn uncontrollably verse-jumps alongside Jobu across many bizarre and diverse universes. Jobu discloses she does not intend to fight, but that instead, she has been searching for an Evelyn who can see, as she does, that nothing matters. She teleports Evelyn to the Everything Bagel, divulging that she wants to use it to allow herself and Evelyn to truly die. Upon looking into the Bagel, Evelyn is initially persuaded, and behaves cruelly and nihilistically in her other universes, hurting those around her. Just as Evelyn enters the Bagel with Jobu, she pauses to listen to Waymond's pleas in her universe for everybody to stop fighting and to instead practice kindness, even when life is senseless. Evelyn has an existentialist epiphany and decides to follow Waymond's absurdist and humanitarian advice, utilizing her multiverse powers to fight with empathy and bring happiness to those around her. In doing so, she repairs her damage in the other universes and neutralizes Alpha-Gong Gong and Jobu's fighters. In her home universe, Evelyn reconciles with Waymond, accepts Joy and Becky's relationship and divulges it to Gong Gong, while Waymond convinces Deirdre to let them redo their taxes. Jobu decides to enter the Bagel alone as, simultaneously in Evelyn's universe, Joy pleads with Evelyn to let her go. Evelyn tells Joy that even when nothing makes sense and even though she could be anywhere else in the multiverse, she will always want to be with Joy. Evelyn and the others save Jobu from the Bagel, and Evelyn and Joy embrace. Sometime later, with the family's relationships improved, they return to the IRS building to refile their taxes. As Deirdre talks, Evelyn's attention is momentarily drawn to her alternative selves, before she grounds herself back in her home universe.",

    "title": "X-Men: Days of Future Past",
    "plot": "In a dystopian 2023, robots called Sentinels hunt and kill mutants, as well as humans who either possess the genetic potential to have mutant offspring or try to protect them. In Moscow, they attack X-Men survivors Shadowcat, Colossus, Blink, Warpath, Bishop, Iceman, and Sunspot. The mutants sacrifice themselves to buy Kitty (Shadowcat) enough time to send Bishop's consciousness a few days into the past to warn the others of the coming attack and ensure their survival. Having averted the attack, the group retreats to a remote Chinese temple and are joined by Storm, Wolverine, Professor X, and Magneto. Xavier explains that the Sentinel program was originally conceived by Bolivar Trask, a weapons designer whom Raven (Mystique) assassinated in 1973. In response, the government approved his program and captured, tortured, and experimented on her, using her DNA to create Sentinels capable of adapting to any mutant power. Xavier plans to go back in time to 1973 and prevent Trask's assassination in the hopes of altering the future. However, upon learning that time-traveling too far would kill Xavier, Logan volunteers instead, as his regenerative abilities would allow him to survive. Awakening in 1973, Logan goes to the X-Mansion, learning from Hank McCoy that the school has been closed for years due to the Vietnam War, and Lehnsherr has been imprisoned for assassinating JFK. A young, broken Xavier has turned to alcoholism and uses a serum that allows him to walk, but at the cost of his telepathic abilities. Hoping to reunite with Raven, Xavier agrees to help Logan. They recruit Quicksilver, a mutant with superhuman speeds, and break Lehnsherr out of The Pentagon, learning that he was in fact attempting to save JFK, who was also a mutant. Raven discovers Trask has been experimenting on mutants and plots to assassinate him at the Paris Peace Accords, but Xavier, McCoy, and Logan foil her attempt. Lehnsherr attempts to kill Raven, believing this would change the future, so McCoy fights him, allowing Raven to escape but publicly exposing them as mutants. Trask takes advantage of this and convinces President Nixon to authorize the Sentinel program. Lehnsherr retrieves his helmet and secretly takes control of Trask's Sentinel prototypes by infusing them with steel. Returning to the X-Mansion, Xavier abandons the serum and, by reading Logan's mind, communicates with his future self, who inspires him to protect the future between mutants and humans. After Xavier uses his mutant-tracking computer Cerebro to find Raven, he, McCoy, and Logan travel to Washington, D.C. to stop her from assassinating Trask. At a ceremony where Nixon unveils the Sentinels, the three search for Raven. Lehnsherr appears, activates the Sentinels, and barricades the White House by lifting the RFK Stadium over it. During the battle, Lehnsherr impales Logan with a rebar and throws him into the Potomac River. Nixon, Trask, and a disguised Raven retreat to the White House Bunker. However, Lehnsherr rips the bunker out of the building to kill everyone inside. In 2023, the X-Men make their last stand as an onslaught of Sentinels attacks the temple, with most of the mutants perishing while trying to buy more time. In 1973, Raven reveals herself and subdues Lehnsherr with a plastic gun, saving Nixon and his cabinet. Before she can kill Trask, Xavier telepathically convinces her to spare him, leading the public to realize that a mutant saved the President and his cabinet. As a result, the Sentinel program is decommissioned, altering the timeline and erasing the dark future of 2023 from history. The mutants in the past depart separately; Trask is later arrested for selling military secrets to foreign governments. Logan reawakens in 2023 at the X-Mansion to find that Xavier's school is thriving and the X-Men are all alive, including Rogue, Jean Grey, and Scott Summers. Logan asks Xavier for information about modern history from 1973 to the present. Upon realizing that the Logan from the original timeline has returned, Xavier assents. Back in 1973, Logan is rescued by Raven, having disguised herself as Major William Stryker. In a post-credits scene set in ancient Egypt, a crowd chants to En Sabah Nur, who telekinetically elevates rocks to build pyramids as his Four Horsemen observe from afar.",

    "plot": "In the 2020s, boxing between human fighters has been replaced with robots. In Texas, former boxer Charlie Kenton owns the robot Ambush until it is destroyed in a fight against a bull belonging to promoter and carnival owner Ricky. Having bet money he did not have with Ricky that Ambush would win, Charlie absconds before Ricky can collect. After the fight, Charlie learns his ex-girlfriend died, and he must attend a hearing about their 11-year-old son Max, whom he hasn’t seen since birth. Max's maternal aunt Debra and her husband Marvin seek full custody. Charlie agrees to give up custody of Max for money, while Marvin negotiates that Charlie keeps custody for three months during their vacation. Settling into a gym owned by Bailey Tallet, the daughter of Charlie's former boxing coach, Charlie uses half the money to acquire the once-famous World Robot Boxing (WRB) robot Noisy Boy. He and Max take Noisy Boy to Crash Palace, an underworld boxing arena run by his friend Finn, where Noisy Boy is destroyed against robot boxer Midas. While searching for replacements in a junkyard and then sliding down a cliff, Max discovers Atom, an obsolete, dilapidated, but mostly intact sparring robot that breaks Max's fall and saves his life. Atom is designed to endure damage with a rare \"shadow function\" program, which mirrors and memorizes the handler's or opponent's movements. Charlie pits Atom against the robot Metro at Max's request, and the junkyard bot surprisingly comes out on top. Max integrates Noisy Boy's voice command hardware with Atom and convinces Charlie to optimize Atom's movements. Altogether, Charlie’s boxing experience and Atom’s shadow function build a winning streak that leads to Charlie being offered a WRB fight between Atom and the national champion, Twin Cities. The fight starts with Atom on the attack, but Twin Cities quickly takes the offensive. Charlie notices a hitch (a brief delay) whenever Twin Cities throws a right punch, and he exploits this to win by knockout. Elated by their success, Max challenges the undefeated global champion robot Zeus. After the fight, Ricky and two henchmen attack Charlie for bailing earlier and rob him and Max of their winnings, prompting a defeated and dejected Charlie to return Max to Debra. When Charlie tries to convince an upset Max that he is better off without him, the boy reveals that all he ever wanted was for him to fight for him and be there as a father. After Max leaves, Charlie returns to Tallet's Gym and talks with Bailey. She persuades him to reconcile with Max, and Charlie convinces Debra to allow Max to come to the fight he set up with Zeus. As the fight begins, Zeus dominates the first round, but Atom manages to survive, stunning the audience. Ricky, who bet with Finn on Atom losing within the first round, tries to leave but is cornered by Finn and his bookmakers. As the fight continues, Atom lands multiple punches and withstands further attacks but makes no definitive progress. Late in the fourth round, Atom's voice-response controls are damaged, forcing Charlie to fight Zeus with Atom's shadow function for the fifth and final round, in which Charlie wards off Zeus with a rope-a-dope tactic long enough to deplete its power core, allowing Atom to begin a counterattack against an exhausted Zeus. With Zeus' programmers unable to compensate, the designer, Tak Mashido, intervenes and controls Zeus manually. Zeus is soundly beaten but narrowly avoids losing by knockout and wins by decision. Despite the match result and remaining undefeated, Zeus is left critically damaged, and Mashido's group is humiliated by the near-loss. The cheering crowd triumphantly labels Atom the \"People's Champion,\" and Max and Charlie celebrate.",

    "title": "Prometheus",
    "plot": "As a spacecraft departs a planet, a tall humanoid alien drinks a black liquid, causing its body to dissolve. Its remains crumble into a waterfall and the alien's DNA falls apart and starts to recombine. In 2089, archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway discover a star map in Scotland that matches others from several unconnected ancient cultures. They interpret this as an invitation from humanity's forerunners, the \"Engineers\". Peter Weyland, the elderly CEO of Weyland Corporation, funds an expedition, aboard the scientific vessel Prometheus, to follow the map to the distant moon LV-223. The ship's crew travels in suspended animation while the android David monitors their voyage. The Prometheus lands on the barren, mountainous surface near a large, artificial structure. The team explores the interior, discovering stone cylinders, a monolithic statue of a humanoid head, and the decapitated corpse of a large alien. Shaw determines the body is that of an Engineer and retrieves its head, intending to bring it back to Prometheus. The crew find other bodies, leading them to surmise that the species is extinct. Crew members Millburn and Fifield grow uncomfortable with the discoveries and attempt to return to Prometheus, but become lost in the structure. The expedition is cut short when a storm forces the crew to return to the ship. David secretly takes a cylinder vase with him, while most of them ooze a black liquid. In the ship's lab, the Engineer's DNA is found to match that of humans. David investigates the contents of the cylinder. He intentionally taints a drink with a minute sample and proposes a toast to the unsuspecting Holloway, who drinks it, having stated he would do anything for answers. Shortly after, Shaw and Holloway have sex. Inside the structure, a snake-like creature kills Millburn, and sprays a corrosive fluid that melts Fifield's helmet. Fifield falls face first into a puddle. When the crew returns, they find Millburn's corpse. David separately discovers a control room containing a surviving Engineer in stasis and a holographic star map highlighting coordinates to Earth. Meanwhile, Holloway sickens rapidly. He is rushed back to Prometheus, but mission director Meredith Vickers refuses to let him aboard. At his urging, she burns him to death with a flamethrower. Later, a medical scan reveals that Shaw, despite being previously infertile, is now in advanced pregnancy. Fearing the worst, she uses an automated surgery table to extract a squid-like creature from her abdomen. Shaw then discovers that Weyland, Vickers' father, has been in stasis aboard Prometheus. He explains that he wants to ask the Engineers how not to die from old age. A monstrous, mutated Fifield returns to the Prometheus and attacks, killing several crewmen before being killed by the captain of Prometheus, Janek. He speculates to Shaw that the structure was actually an Engineer military base that lost control of a virulent biological weapon. The structure also houses a spacecraft. Weyland and the team return to the structure, accompanied by Shaw. David wakes the Engineer from stasis and speaks to him in Proto-Indo-European to try to explain what Weyland wants. The Engineer responds by decapitating David and killing Weyland and his team, before reactivating the spacecraft. Shaw desperately flees and warns Janek that the Engineer is planning to release the menace on Earth to exterminate all life forms, convincing him to stop the spacecraft. Janek and the remaining crew sacrifice themselves by ramming the Prometheus into the alien craft, ejecting the lifeboat in the process. The Engineer's disabled spacecraft crashes onto the ground, crushing Vickers. Shaw goes to the lifeboat and finds her alien offspring is alive and has grown to gigantic size. The Engineer forces open the lifeboat's airlock and attacks Shaw, who releases her alien offspring onto him. It thrusts an ovipositor down the Engineer's throat, subduing him. Shaw recovers David's remains and intends to reach the Engineers' home world in an attempt to understand why they wanted to destroy humanity. With David's help, she launches another Engineer spacecraft and departs from LV-223. In the lifeboat left on the planet, an alien creature bursts out of the dead Engineer's chest.",

    "plot": "In a prehistoric veld, a tribe of hominins is driven away from a water hole by a rival tribe, and the next day finds an alien monolith. The tribe learns how to use a bone as a weapon and, after a successful first hunt, uses it to drive the rival tribe away. Millions of years later, Dr Heywood Floyd, Chairman of the United States National Council of Astronautics, travels to Clavius Base, an American lunar outpost. During a stopover at Space Station Five, he meets Russian scientists who are concerned that Clavius seems to be unresponsive. He refuses to discuss rumours of an epidemic at the base. At Clavius, Floyd addresses a meeting of personnel to whom he stresses the need for secrecy regarding their newest discovery. His mission is to investigate a recently found artefact, a monolith buried four million years earlier near the lunar crater Tycho. As Floyd and others examine and photograph the object, it emits a high-powered radio signal. Eighteen months later, the American spacecraft Discovery One is bound for Jupiter, with mission pilots and scientists Dr Dave Bowman and Dr Frank Poole on board, along with three other scientists in suspended animation. Most of Discovery's operations are controlled by HAL, a HAL 9000 computer with a human-like personality. When HAL reports the imminent failure of an antenna control device, Bowman retrieves it in an extravehicular activity (EVA) pod, but finds nothing wrong. HAL suggests reinstalling the device and letting it fail so the problem can be verified. Mission Control advises the astronauts that results from their backup 9000 computer indicate that HAL has made an error, but HAL blames it on human error. Concerned about HAL's behaviour, Bowman and Poole enter an EVA pod so they can talk in private without HAL overhearing. They agree to disconnect HAL if he is proven wrong. HAL follows their conversation by lip reading. While Poole is floating away from his pod to replace the antenna unit, HAL takes control of the pod and attacks him, sending Poole tumbling away from the ship with a severed air line. Bowman takes another pod to rescue Poole. While he is outside, HAL turns off the life support functions of the crewmen in suspended animation, killing them. When Bowman returns to the ship with Poole's body, HAL refuses to let him back in, stating that their plan to deactivate him jeopardises the mission. Bowman releases Poole's body and opens the ship's emergency airlock with his remote manipulators. Lacking a helmet for his spacesuit, he positions his pod carefully so that when he jettisons the pod's door, he is propelled by the escaping air across the vacuum into Discovery's airlock. He enters HAL's processor core and begins disconnecting most of HAL's circuits, ignoring HAL's pleas to stop. When he is finished, a prerecorded video by Heywood Floyd plays, revealing that the mission's actual objective is to investigate the radio signal sent from the monolith to Jupiter. At Jupiter, Bowman finds a third, much larger monolith orbiting the planet. He leaves Discovery in an EVA pod to investigate. He is pulled into a vortex of coloured light and observes bizarre astronomical phenomena and strange landscapes of unusual colours as he passes by. Finally, he finds himself in a large neoclassical bedroom where he sees, and then becomes, older versions of himself: first standing in the bedroom, middle-aged and still in his spacesuit, then dressed in leisure attire and eating dinner, and finally as an old man lying in bed. A monolith appears at the foot of the bed, and as Bowman reaches for it, he is transformed into a foetus enclosed in a transparent orb of light, which afterwards floats in space above the Earth.",

    "title": "The Martian",
    "plot": "In 2035, the crew of the Ares III mission to Mars is exploring Acidalia Planitia on Martian solar day (sol) 18 of their 31-sol expedition. A severe dust storm threatens their Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) and in the ensuing evacuation, astronaut Mark Watney is struck by flying debris and presumed dead. Facing imminent peril, the remaining crew takes off for their orbiting vessel, the Hermes, which will then return them to Earth. Watney awakens after the storm, narrowly surviving from his injuries. As he recovers within the crew's surface habitat (\"Hab\"), he begins a video diary to document his thoughts on survival. Unable to communicate with Earth, his only chance of rescue is the next Mars mission in four years, where Ares IV will land at the Schiaparelli crater. The Ares IV MAV has already arrived on the site in preparation for the mission. With this timeframe in mind, Watney's main survival concerns are food and travel. Being a botanist, he cultivates a potato garden inside the Hab using the crew's bio-waste with Martian soil, and creates water from leftover rocket fuel. He also modifies a crewed rover for the journey to Schiaparelli. On Earth, NASA satellite planner Mindy Park notices Watney's activity from recorded satellite images, and suspects he must be alive. NASA director Teddy Sanders releases the news to the public but decides not to inform the Ares III crew en route to Earth, over flight director Mitch Henderson's strong objection. Watney explores the surrounding terrain and studies his maps, but he quickly journeys out to retrieve the Pathfinder probe, hoping to restore its communications. Mars missions director Vincent Kapoor realizes this strategy, and quickly visits Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) director Bruce Ng to use their replica of the probe. The agency makes contact with Watney and instructs him to link Pathfinder to the rover, where he can now communicate by text. With this breakthrough, Henderson is finally allowed to inform Watney's crewmates. As Watney enters the Hab on one evening, a leak in the airlock causes an explosion that injures him and destroys the potato garden. Although he repairs the airlock, he is again threatened by starvation. NASA scrambles to procure a resupply ship for Watney, with Sanders ordering routine safety inspections bypassed to expedite the mission. This oversight results in catastrophe as the ship disintegrates shortly after launch. The China National Space Administration decides to offer a launch vehicle — originally intended for the Taiyang Shen space probe — to resupply Watney. Astrophysicist Rich Purnell devises an alternative plan: send the Taiyang Shen launcher to resupply the Hermes, which will then use Earth's gravity to \"slingshot\" back to Mars two years earlier than Ares IV. Sanders flatly rejects the idea, considering it too risky for the Ares III crew. Henderson surreptitiously sends the proposal to the crew, and they unanimously vote in favor and divert the Hermes. Sanders is forced to support them publicly, but demands Henderson's resignation after the mission. After waiting several months, Watney embarks on the long journey to the Ares IV MAV. He plans to use it to rendezvous with the Hermes, but needs to lighten the load considerably by partially dismantling the cockpit. He takes off to orbit, but the Hermes crew find that they remain too far and too fast to retrieve him. Commander Lewis quickly improvises to explode the airlock in part of the ship, resulting in air violently escaping and slowing them down. Lewis also pilots a tethered Manned Maneuvering Unit to personally reach Watney, but they are still too far apart. Watney quickly improvises by piercing his pressure suit, and propels himself with the escaping air only to narrowly catch onto Lewis. NASA and spectators across the world all celebrate the successful rescue. After returning to Earth, Watney becomes a survival instructor for astronaut candidates. Five years later, as the Ares V is about to launch, those involved in Watney's rescue are seen in their current lives watching the launch footage.",

    "plot": "In 2026, ten years after a deadly \"Simian Flu\" pandemic wiped out humanity, humans are nearly extinct, with only about 1 in 500 (0.2%) genetically immune. Human civilization was destroyed after societal collapse among humans. The apes, all bestowed with genetically enhanced intelligence by the virus, establish a colony in the Muir Woods National Monument near San Francisco, led by Caesar, along with his lieutenants Maurice, Rocket and Koba. A group of humans, led by Malcolm, unknowingly enter the apes' territory, searching for a hydroelectric dam that would restore power to their community in the ruined city. Carver, a member of Malcolm's group, injures Ash, Rocket's young son, in fear. Malcolm manages to prevent further escalation, and Caesar orders the humans to leave. Prompted by Koba, Caesar brings his army to the human community as a show of strength. Caesar announces that, while the apes do not want war, they will fight to defend themselves; he demands the humans stay in their territory. Malcolm convinces Dreyfus, the community's leader, to give him a chance to take a small team to the forest to negotiate with the apes and access the dam. Eventually, Caesar allows them to work on the generator, but on the condition that they surrender their guns. While working together, Malcolm, his nurse wife, Ellie, and his son, Alexander, bond with the apes. The fragile truce briefly falls apart when Carver is discovered to have kept a hidden gun and is thus forcibly sent away, but trust is restored when Ellie saves Cornelia, Caesar's ill wife. Concerned that the apes may attack, Dreyfus arms the community with the munitions at the Fort Point armory. Koba, who hated the humans for torturing him as a laboratory test subject, discovers the armory and confronts Caesar, accusing him of caring more about humans than apes. Caesar beats Koba in response but refrains from killing him. Koba kills two guards in the armory to steal a gun and returns home. He secretly kills Carver after the humans succeed in repairing the generator. Koba uses their celebration to covertly set fire to the ape colony. Unseen by the others, he shoots Caesar, who falls into the underbrush. Koba frames the humans for Caesar's apparent death and the fire to justify war. Taking command, he leads the ape army to San Francisco, where they plunder the armory and mount a full-scale assault on the humans. Despite taking heavy casualties, the apes breach the building and imprison the humans as Dreyfus flees. Koba kills Ash for refusing to kill unarmed humans and imprisons all other apes loyal to Caesar, including Rocket, Maurice and Luca. Malcolm's family finds a severely wounded Caesar and transports him to his former home in San Francisco. After sneaking back into the settlement to find medical supplies, Malcolm encounters Blue Eyes, Caesar's young son. Blue Eyes has him at gunpoint but decides to let him go until he learns from Malcolm that his father is still alive. Blue Eyes accompanies Malcolm to Caesar. Learning that Koba shot Caesar, Blue Eyes reconciles with his father. The trio returns to the community and frees the imprisoned humans and apes. After escorting the apes into the tower, Malcolm finds Dreyfus, who has rigged the tower base with explosives, and reveals that his men contacted a military base. Malcolm holds Dreyfus and his men at gunpoint to give Caesar enough time to retake command by confronting Koba at the top of the tower. In an attempt to kill all the apes, Dreyfus detonates explosives to destabilize the building, killing himself in the process. Caesar defeats Koba and refuses to help him as he falls to his death. Malcolm warns Caesar of the approaching human military. Believing that the humans will never forgive the apes for their attack, Caesar tells Malcolm to leave with his family for safety before the fighting begins. He then addresses the apes as they prepare for the upcoming war.",

Using the bottle to track Banner, Ross sends a special forces team led by Emil Blonsky to capture him. Banner transforms into the Hulk and defeats Blonsky's team, though Blonsky survives. After Ross explains how Banner became the Hulk, Blonsky agrees to be injected with a similar serum, gaining enhanced speed, strength, and agility. Banner returns to Culver University and reunites with Betty. Her new boyfriend, Dr. Leonard Samson, contacts Ross who soon arrives with his forces and Blonsky. They attack Banner at the university and he transforms into the Hulk again. Blonsky, whose judgement is impaired by the serum, attacks and mocks the Hulk. The Hulk severely injures Blonsky, but the serum allows him to heal quickly. Betty is almost killed by military fire and is saved by the Hulk, who flees with Betty and eventually reverts to Banner. The pair go on the run, and Banner contacts Mr. Blue who urges them to meet him in New York City. Mr. Blue is cellular biologist Dr. Samuel Sterns, who has developed a possible antidote to Banner's condition. After a seemingly successful test, he warns Banner that the antidote may only reverse an initial transformation. Sterns reveals that he has synthesized Banner's blood samples, which Banner sent from Brazil, into a large supply, and wants to apply its \"limitless potential\" to medicine. Fearful of the Hulk's power falling into the wrong hands, Banner wants to destroy the supply. Blonsky and Ross's forces take Banner into custody. As Banner and Betty are taken away in a helicopter, Blonsky stays behind and orders Sterns to inject him with Banner's blood, as he covets the Hulk's power. The experiment mutates Blonsky into the Abomination, a monstrous creature with size and strength surpassing that of the Hulk. He attacks Sterns, who gets some of Banner's blood in a cut on his forehead and begins mutating as well. The Abomination rampages through Harlem. Realizing that the Hulk is the only one who can stop the Abomination, Banner convinces Ross to release him. He jumps from Ross's helicopter and transforms after hitting the ground. The Hulk defeats the Abomination by nearly strangling him to death with a chain, but spares his life upon hearing Betty's plea. The Hulk leaves the Abomination for Ross and his forces to arrest and flees New York. A month later, Banner is in Bella Coola, British Columbia, where he practices transforming in a controlled manner. Sometime later, Tony Stark approaches Ross at a bar and informs him that a team is being put together.",

    "plot": "In 2009, American geologist Adrian Helmsley visits astrophysicist Satnam Tsurutani in Jharkhand, India, and learns that a previously undiscovered type of neutrino from a solar flare is heating the Earth's core. Returning to Washington, D.C., Adrian alerts White House Chief of Staff Carl Anheuser and President Thomas Wilson. A year later, over forty-six nations begin building nine arks in the Himalayas in Tibet, and storing artifacts in secure locations. Nima, a Buddhist monk, is evacuated with his grandparents, while his brother Tenzin joins the ark project. Additional funding is secretly raised by selling tickets to the rich for €1 billion per person. In 2012, struggling science-fiction writer Jackson Curtis is a chauffeur in Los Angeles for Russian billionaire Yuri Karpov. Jackson's former wife Kate and their children, Noah and Lilly, live with Kate's boyfriend, plastic surgeon and amateur pilot Gordon Silberman. Jackson takes Noah and Lilly camping at Yellowstone National Park. When they find Yellowstone Lake dried up and fenced off by the United States Army, they are caught and brought to Adrian. They later meet conspiracy theorist and radio personality Charlie Frost, who tells Jackson of Charles Hapgood's earth crust displacement theory and how the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar predicts the end of the world in 2012, and that the world's governments silence anyone attempting to warn the public. Despite his initial skepticism, Jackson begins to take Charlie's warning seriously after witnessing several signs that seem to confirm it. These include a conversation with Yuri’s sons, Alec and Oleg, who warn of impending disaster after Jackson drops them off at Santa Monica Airport. He rents a Cessna 340A and sets out to rescue his family. As the Pacific Coast suffers a catastrophic 10.9-magnitude quake along the San Andreas Fault, Jackson and his family reach the airport and get the Cessna airborne before the coast sinks into the Pacific Ocean. The group flies to Yellowstone and Jackson retrieves Charlie's map of the arks' location, just as the Yellowstone Caldera begins to erupt. Charlie stays behind to finish his broadcast and is killed by debris. Realizing they need a larger plane to fly to the Himalayas, the group lands at McCarran International Airport south of Downtown Las Vegas to locate one. Adrian, Carl, and First Daughter Laura fly to the arks while President Wilson remains in the White House to address the nation. Jackson finds the Karpovs, Yuri's girlfriend Tamara, and their pilot Sasha. Sasha and Gordon fly the families out in an Antonov An-500, as the volcanic ash from Yellowstone envelops the Las Vegas Valley. The planet's crust shifts, resulting in billions of deaths in disasters worldwide, including President Wilson. With the presidential line of succession broken, Carl appoints himself acting commander-in-chief. Upon reaching the Himalayas, the Antonov's engines malfunction. As the plane touches down on a glacier, the party uses a Bentley Flying Spur stored in the hold to escape, while Sasha stays in the cockpit and is killed when the jet goes over a cliff. The survivors are spotted by Chinese Armed Police helicopters which take only the three ticket-bearing Karpovs, leaving Tamara and Jackson's family behind. The group encounters Nima, who, with his own family, takes them to the arks, where they stow away on Ark 4 with Tenzin's help. With a megatsunami approaching, Carl orders the loading gates closed, though many people have not yet boarded. Adrian persuades the captain and the other surviving world leaders to allow more passengers aboard the arks, while Yuri falls to his death as he pushes his sons onto Ark 4. As the gate closes, Tenzin is injured and Gordon is fatally crushed. Tenzin's impact driver lodges in the gate mechanism, preventing it from closing completely and disabling the ship's engines. As the tsunami strikes, the ark starts flooding as it is set adrift, heading for Mount Everest. Adrian rushes to clear the gears, but watertight doors close, trapping the stowaways and drowning Tamara. Noah and Jackson dislodge the tool, and the crew regains control of the ark. Twenty-seven days later, the waters start receding. The arks approach the Cape of Good Hope, where the Drakensberg Mountains are now the highest mountain range on Earth. Adrian and Laura begin a relationship, while Jackson and Kate reconcile.",

    "title": "Tenet",
    "plot": "On \"the 14th,” the Protagonist leads a covert CIA extraction during a staged terrorist siege at an Opera House in Kyiv. He is saved from KORD forces by a masked operative wearing an orange cord with a round trinket. The Protagonist retrieves an artifact but his team is captured and tortured. He swallows a suicide pill but wakes up to find it was a fake—a test that only he passed. He is recruited by \"Tenet,” a secretive organization that briefs him on objects with \"inverted\" entropy that move backward through time. With his handler Neil, he traces inverted munitions to Priya Singh, an arms dealer in Mumbai. Priya reveals that she is a member of Tenet, and the man who inverted her bullets, Russian oligarch Andrei Sator, is communicating with the future. Sator's estranged wife Kat Barton is an art appraiser who authenticated a Goya forged by her friend Arepo. Sator purchased the Goya at auction believing it to be legitimate, later using it to blackmail Kat into staying with him. To earn Kat's help, the Protagonist and Neil try to steal the Goya from Sator's freeport facility at Oslo Airport but are thwarted by two masked men who emerge from either side of a machine. In Mumbai, Priya explains it was a \"turnstile\"—a device that inverts entropy. The two men were the same person, traveling in opposite directions through time. She reveals that Sator sabotaged his CIA team but KORD has the artifact, which is weapons-grade plutonium. Believing that the Protagonist has destroyed the forgery, Kat introduces him to Sator in Italy. Sator agrees to help steal the artifact, which the Protagonist and Neil do in Tallinn, but they are ambushed by an inverted Sator holding Kat hostage. The Protagonist hides the artifact and rescues Kat, but they are recaptured and taken to a freeport in Tallinn where the inverted Sator interrogates them for the location of the artifact, shooting Kat with an inverted bullet. Tenet troops led by Commander Ives arrive, but Sator escapes into the turnstile. To save Kat's life, they also invert themselves. The inverted Protagonist drives back to the ambush to retrieve the hidden artifact where he encounters Sator, who overpowers him and takes it. To un-invert, the Protagonist travels back in time to the freeport in Oslo, fights his past self, and enters the turnstile, followed by Neil and Kat. In Oslo, Priya tells him Sator now has all nine pieces of the Algorithm, a device that future antagonists need to invert the entropy of the world and destroy its past. Priya had planned for Sator to get the artifact to reveal the other eight pieces in preparing his dead drop. Recalling an earlier conversation with Michael Crosby, the Protagonist realizes it is a nuclear hypocenter detonated on the 14th in Sator's hometown, the Russian closed city of Stalsk-12. On a Tenet ship traveling back to the 14th, Kat reveals Sator has terminal cancer and is omnicidal. They surmise that after the Kyiv opera house siege on the 14th, Sator returns to a family vacation in Vietnam to commit suicide, sending the dead drop coordinates to the future via a dead man's switch. Arriving at the 14th, Kat poses as her past self in Vietnam as the Tenet forces in Stalsk-12 recover the Algorithm. They use a \"temporal pincer movement,\" with inverted and non-inverted troops creating a diversion so the Protagonist and Ives can steal the Algorithm before detonation. Sator's henchman, Volkov, traps them in the hypocenter. Calling from Vietnam, Sator explains the antagonists are trying to prevent catastrophes that will be caused by climate change. As Volkov is about to execute the Protagonist, an inverted soldier with an orange cord with a trinket appears and sacrifices himself, enabling the Protagonist and Ives to escape with the Algorithm. The hypocenter detonates in Stalsk-12 just as Kat kills Sator in Vietnam. In Stalsk-12, the Protagonist, Neil, and Ives arrange to separate and hide pieces of the Algorithm. The Protagonist notices the orange cord and trinket on Neil's bag. Neil reveals that he was recruited in his past by a future Protagonist and that Neil has known him for a long time. He leaves them his piece of the algorithm to invert and go back in time to sacrifice himself in the hypocenter. Later, in London, Priya plans to kill Kat to maintain the secrecy of Tenet. Having realized that he is Tenet's creator, the Protagonist kills Priya and watches Kat leave with her son.",

    "title": "Sphere",
    "plot": "A spacecraft presumed to be of alien origin is discovered on the floor of the Pacific Ocean, estimated to have been there for nearly 300 years. A team of experts, including marine biologist Dr. Beth Halperin, mathematician Dr. Harry Adams, astrophysicist Dr. Ted Fielding, psychologist Dr. Norman Goodman, and U.S. Navy Captain Harold Barnes, is assembled and taken to the Habitat, a state-of-the-art underwater living environment located near the spacecraft. Examining the spacecraft, they are perplexed to learn it is not alien at all, but rather American in origin. However, its technology far surpasses any in the present day. The ship's computer logs cryptically suggest a mission that originated either in the distant past or future, but the team deduces that the long-dead crew was tasked with collecting an item of scientific importance. Norman and Beth discover the ship's logs, with the last entry noting an \"unknown event\". A holographic reenactment of the event reveals that hundreds of years in the future, the ship encountered a black hole, which apparently led to a crash landing in the ocean, back in the 1700s. Soon after, Norman and the others stumble on a large, yet perfect sphere hovering in the cargo bay. They cannot find any way to probe the inside of the sphere, as the fluid surface seems to be impenetrable. On observation, Norman ominously notes that the sphere reflects everything in the room, except them. When they return to the Habitat, Harry hypothesizes that everyone on this team is fated to die. Harry notes that the black hole is referred to as an \"unknown event\" in the future logs. However, here in the present, they have knowledge of the historic event, yet it is unable to be explained later on. During the night, Harry returns to the spacecraft and is able to enter the sphere. Norman follows Harry, where he finds him unconscious next to the sphere, and returns him to the Habitat. The next day, the crew discovers a series of numerically encoded messages appearing on the computer screens. The crew is able to decipher them, and comes to believe they are speaking to \"Jerry\", an alien intelligence from the sphere. They find that Jerry is able to see and hear everything that happens on the Habitat. A powerful typhoon strikes the surface, and the Habitat crew is forced to stay in the Habitat several more days. During that time, a series of tragedies strikes the crew, including attacks from aggressive jellyfish and a giant squid, and equipment failures in the base that kill Ted, Barnes and the team's support staff. The survivors, Beth, Harry and Norman, believe Jerry is responsible. Norman discovers that they had misinterpreted the initial messages from Jerry, and that the entity speaking to them through the computers is actually Harry himself, transmitted from his mind while he is asleep. Norman and Beth eventually realize that when Harry entered the sphere, he gained the ability to make anything he imagines a reality, and they conclude that all the horrors that have befallen the Habitat were manifestations of Harry's fears. Norman and Beth sedate Harry with enough sleeping drugs to put him into a dreamless sleep, to prevent him from doing any further damage. However, when Norman is attacked by a snake, Beth realizes that Harry alone could not have been responsible for everything that had happened on the Habitat, and she confronts Norman, accusing him of entering the sphere when he went to retrieve Harry. Beth's suspicions prove to be correct, but after experiencing her own nightmarish vision, she confesses to Norman that she too entered the sphere. When rejoined by Harry, the three of them realize that the crew of the ship must have also entered the sphere, and they ended up killing each other after being driven mad by their fears. Under the stress of the situation, Beth has suicidal thoughts, which causes the detonation mechanisms on a store of explosives to engage, threatening to destroy the base and the spacecraft. They race to the Habitat's mini-sub, but their combined fears cause them to reappear back in the spacecraft. As a psychologist, Norman is able to see through the illusion. He triggers the mini-sub's undocking process, and overrides the others' fears that they will not escape the destruction of the Habitat and spacecraft. The sphere is untouched by the explosions. The mini-sub makes it to the surface as the surface ships return. As Beth, Harry and Norman begin safe decompression, they realize that they will be debriefed and their newfound powers discovered. Fearing humans are not ready for this ability they agree to erase their memories of the event using their powers, to ensure the \"unknown event\" paradox is resolved. The sphere then rises from the ocean and accelerates away into distant space.",

    "plot": "Ellen Ripley has been in stasis for 57 years aboard a shuttlecraft after destroying her spaceship, the Nostromo, to escape an alien creature that slaughtered her crew. Ripley is rescued and debriefed by her Weyland-Yutani Corporation employers who doubt her claim about alien eggs in a derelict ship on the exomoon LV-426, now the site of a terraforming colony. After contact is lost with the colony, Weyland-Yutani representative Carter Burke and Colonial Marine Lieutenant Gorman ask Ripley to accompany them to investigate. Still traumatized by her alien encounter, she agrees on the condition that they exterminate the creatures. Ripley meets the Colonial Marines aboard the spaceship Sulaco but distrusts their android, Bishop, because the Nostromo's android, Ash, had betrayed its crew to protect the alien on company orders. A dropship lands the crew on LV-426, where they find the battle-ravaged colony and two live alien facehuggers in containment tanks. The only colonist found is a traumatized young girl nicknamed Newt. The team locates the other colonists' signals beneath the fusion-powered atmosphere processing station and heads to their location, descending into corridors covered in alien secretions. At the station's center, the marines discover opened eggs, dead facehuggers, and cocooned colonists serving as incubators for the alien embryos. The marines kill a newborn alien after it bursts through a colonist's chest, rousing several adult aliens who ambush the marines, killing or capturing many. When the inexperienced Gorman panics, Ripley assumes command and rams their armored personnel carrier into the nest to rescue Corporal Dwayne Hicks, and Privates Hudson and Vasquez. Hicks orders the dropship to recover the survivors, but a stowaway alien kills the pilots, causing the dropship to crash into the station. Low on ammunition and resources, the survivors barricade themselves inside the colony facility. Ripley discovers that Burke ordered the colonists to investigate the derelict spaceship containing the alien eggs, intending to profit by recovering them for biological weapon research. Before she can expose Burke, Bishop reports that the dropship crash damaged the power plant's cooling system, and it will soon overheat and explode, destroying the colony. Bishop volunteers to travel to the colony transmitter and remotely pilot the remaining dropship to the surface. Asleep in the medical lab, Ripley and Newt awaken to find themselves trapped with the two released facehuggers. Ripley triggers a fire alarm to alert the marines, who rescue them and kill the creatures. She accuses Burke of releasing the facehuggers to implant her and Newt with alien embryos to smuggle them through Earth's quarantine. The power is suddenly cut, and aliens attack through the ceiling. In the ensuing firefight, the aliens kill Burke, subdue Hudson, and injure Hicks; the cornered Gorman and Vasquez sacrifice themselves to avoid capture. Newt is separated from Ripley and taken by the creatures. Ripley takes Hicks to the dropship but refuses to abandon Newt and arms herself before descending into the processing station hive alone to rescue her. During their escape, they encounter the alien queen amid dozens of eggs. When one opens, Ripley burns the eggs and blows up the queen's ovipositor. Pursued by the enraged queen, Ripley and Newt reach the dropship and escape with Bishop and an unconscious Hicks moments before the station explodes, consuming the colony in a nuclear blast. Aboard the Sulaco, the queen, stowed away in the dropship's landing gear, attacks the group. The queen rips Bishop in half and advances on Newt, but Ripley battles the creature using an exosuit cargo loader, expelling it into space through an airlock while the damaged Bishop shields Newt. Ripley, Newt, Hicks, and Bishop then enter hypersleep for their return trip to Earth.",

    "title": "Mickey 17",
    "plot": "In 2050, to escape the global reach of a murderous loan shark, Mickey Barnes and his friend Timo join a spaceship crew to colonize the ice-planet Niflheim. Timo becomes a shuttle pilot, while Mickey joins as an \"Expendable\", a controversial job involving extremely dangerous tasks, with death resulting in a new clone of him with restored memories being created through a process called \"reprinting\". During the voyage, a romance develops between Mickey and security agent Nasha. Four years later, the spaceship arrives at Niflheim. After experimenting on and sacrificing multiple iterations of Mickey, the ship's scientists develop a vaccine for the planet's pathogens. The seventeenth Mickey is sent to capture a native lifeform dubbed \"Creepers\", but falls into a fissure. Timo retrieves Mickey's valuable flamethrower but, out of convenience, leaves Mickey to die. The Creepers swarm Mickey, but instead of eating him, they carry him to the surface. Mickey returns to the ship and is surprised to find an aggressive Mickey 18 has been printed. The expedition's leader, politician Kenneth Marshall, has sworn that in the event of \"Multiples\" of clones, all clones will be eliminated. As a result, Mickey 18 attempts to kill Mickey 17, but 17 suggests they secretly rotate duties and deaths to survive. The two are interrupted when they witness Timo selling flamethrower fuel as drugs. Furious at Timo's abuses, Mickey 18 tries to kill Timo, but relents when they are interrupted by Nasha. 18 leaves with Nasha, while 17 is taken to dinner with Marshall, his wife Ylfa, and security agent Kai. At the dinner, Mickey 17 reacts severely to being fed experimental meat and painkillers. Kai saves Mickey 17 from being executed and brings him to her quarters, but Mickey 17 flees back to Nasha when Kai attempts to seduce him. Nasha learns of the clones and accepts them, but Kai stumbles across the trio and tries to report them. When Mickey 17 informs 18 of the dinner incident, an enraged 18 decides to kill Marshall at a public ceremony unveiling a Niflheim rock to commemorate the expedition. Two baby Creepers, Luko and Zoco, emerge from the rock, causing panic. Mickey 17 captures Zoco, but Luko is killed by security when it startles Marshall. Nasha stops Mickey 18 from killing Marshall, but the Multiples are exposed, leading to Mickey 17, 18, and Nasha's arrest. Meanwhile, thousands of Creepers gather outside the ship, calling for Zoco. In the brig, Mickey 17's description of the Creepers helping him causes Nasha to realize they are sentient. Timo arrives to dismember Mickey 17 on orders from the loan shark, who has an agent on the expedition. Mickey 18 offers to take 17's place in a ruse, allowing Nasha to escape and overpower Timo, but security intervenes and takes them all to Marshall. Marshall announces his plan to eliminate the Creepers, and destroys Mickey's memory backups to prevent him from being reprinted. Ylfa convinces Marshall to make the Mickeys go outside and compete to collect Creeper tails for culinary usage, with the winner allowed to live. The Mickeys are fitted with remote-detonated bomb vests to ensure compliance. Once outside, the Mickeys seek out the Creepers' leader. Marshall follows with a security team to eliminate them and the Creepers when they do not follow through with their task. Mickey 17 uses a translation device to warn the mother Creeper about Marshall's plan, and the mother demands Zoco's release and the sacrifice of a human in compensation for Luko's death. Mickey 17 signals to Nasha to free Zoco. She takes Ylfa hostage to ensure Zoco's release, and security agents, secretly working against Marshall, arrest Ylfa. Mickey 18 fights Marshall and detonates his vest, killing himself and Marshall to meet the Creepers' demands. Afterwards, Mickey 17 and the rest of the expedition make peace with the Creepers, Marshall and Ylfa's collaborators face justice, and Ylfa kills herself. The loan shark associate attacks Timo, but Timo kills him in self-defense and uses the incident to testify against the loan shark. Nasha joins the colony's leadership council. Spring arrives and during the colony's groundbreaking ceremony, Mickey 17, now called Mickey Barnes once again, destroys the cloning device, ending the Expendable program.",

    "title": "Chappie",
    "plot": "A skyrocketing crime rate leads the city of Johannesburg, South Africa to buy a squadron of scouts—state-of-the-art armor-plated attack robots—from weapons manufacturer Tetravaal. These autonomous androids were developed by British scientist Deon Wilson and largely supplant the overwhelmed human police force. A competing project within Tetravaal is the remote-controlled MOOSE, developed by Australian soldier-turned-engineer Vincent Moore. Deon is praised for Tetravaal's success, but Vincent grows envious when the police will not give his heavy weapons platform equal attention. At home, Deon creates a prototype artificial intelligence that mimics a human mind, feeling emotions and having opinions, but Tetravaal CEO Michelle Bradley refuses to permit testing the A.I. on a police robot. Undeterred, he takes a recently damaged one before it is destroyed, putting it in his van, along with the \"guard key\" needed to update its software. Heading home with the damaged robot, Deon is kidnapped by gang members Ninja, Yolandi, and Amerika. When he explains Tetravaal does not have remote controls for the police robots, they order him to reprogram it instead. Deon installs the new software into the damaged robot, which then responds with childlike trepidation upon powering up. Deon and Yolandi calm it, teach it words, and name it \"Chappie\". Despite Deon wanting to stay with Chappie, Ninja forces him out of their hideout. Ninja's gang only has a few days to pay a debt of 20 million rand to Hippo. Yolandi sees Chappie as a child and wants to mother him, but Ninja grows impatient with his development due to both the impending deadline for the debt and Chappie's irreplaceable battery running out, giving him days to live. Ninja leaves Chappie in a dangerous neighborhood to fend for himself to train him to become a gangster. After being wounded by thugs, he is followed by Vincent, who plans to deactivate all Tetravaal scouts except for MOOSE. Vincent successfully extracts the guard key for his own use, but the traumatized Chappie escapes and returns to the hideout. Yolandi scolds Ninja for this mistreatment, but he earns Chappie's forgiveness by training him in martial arts and weapon handling. Ninja and Amerika trick Chappie into stealing cars, and lie about getting the money to replace his dying body. At Tetravaal, Vincent uses the guard key to upload a virus, thus sabotaging and disabling all scouts including Chappie. Johannesburg's criminals immediately run rampant in the streets and Deon brings Chappie to the Tetravaal factory to fix him. After being restarted, Chappie notices a helmet used to control MOOSE. At the hideout, he re-engineers it to transfer his consciousness into a computer, so he can change bodies when his current one dies. Ninja's gang uses Chappie to rob an armored car, which is caught on the news, prompting Tetravaal to pursue him. When Chappie learns that Ninja's plan to acquire the body is a lie, he prepares to kill Ninja for betrayal. However, Deon arrives to warn them that Bradley has ordered that Chappie be destroyed. At that moment, the MOOSE robot (controlled remotely by Vincent) is launched to assassinate Deon and Chappie at the hideout, simultaneously as Hippo arrives to collect his debt. Amerika and Hippo are killed in the ensuing battle while Deon is mortally wounded. When Ninja is about to be killed, Yolandi sacrifices herself to save him, and Chappie destroys MOOSE with a bomb. Enraged by Yolandi's death, Chappie drives Deon to the factory, storms into an office, and fiercely beats Vincent close to death. He then transfers the dying Deon's consciousness into a spare robot through the modified MOOSE helmet. In return, the now-robotic Deon wirelessly transfers Chappie's consciousness into one of the nearby disabled scouts. Deon and Chappie go into hiding as the police discontinue their contract with Tetravaal, while it is implied that Vincent, assuming he survived, now faces serious criminal charges. While burning memorabilia of Yolandi, the grieving Ninja finds a box containing a doll copy of her and a flash drive marked \"Mommy's Consciousness Test Backup\" which contains a copy of Yolandi's consciousness that Chappie took while testing the device on her. Chappie hacks into Tetravaal's manufacturing facility, builds a robot resembling Yolandi, and uploads the flash drive's contents.",

As Cletus's execution begins, a red symbiote emerges and blocks the injection. Named Carnage, it goes on a violent rampage through the prison, freeing inmates and killing guards. Carnage agrees to help Cletus break Frances out of Ravencroft in exchange for Cletus's help eliminating Eddie and Venom. Mulligan visits Eddie at home and warns him about the situation. At Ravencroft, Cletus frees Frances, and they travel to the St. Estes children's home to burn it down. Mulligan grows suspicious of Eddie and arrests him. Eddie contacts Anne as his lawyer and reveals that Venom has separated from him. As Venom makes his way through San Francisco by hopping from body to body, Anne finds him bonded to Mrs. Chen and convinces him to forgive Eddie. Venom reunites with Eddie after first bonding with Anne to get into the police station, and they escape custody. Cletus takes Mulligan hostage, and Frances captures Anne, taking them both to Grace Cathedral where Cletus and Frances plan to get married. Eddie and Venom arrive to fight Carnage, while Frances seemingly kills Mulligan by hanging him with a chain. Venom is overpowered by Carnage but provokes Frances into using her powers to separate Carnage and Cletus, who are both devoured by Venom, while the collapsing cathedral crushes Frances. Mulligan is revealed to be alive, and his eyes glow blue, as he has been infected by a piece of Carnage. Eddie and Venom, once again fugitives, decide to take a vacation while they ponder their next steps. In a mid-credits scene, as Venom tells Eddie about the symbiotes' knowledge of other universes, a blinding light suddenly transports them from their hotel room to another room where they watch J. Jonah Jameson talking about Spider-Man's revealed identity as Peter Parker on television.",

    "plot": "Five days after the assault on the Abnegation faction by the Erudite leader Jeanine and her mind-controlled Dauntless soldiers, Jeanine has declared martial law, insisting the Divergents and their allies are the enemies. Among the Abnegation wreckage, the Dauntless leaders Max and Eric recover a box with all five faction symbols on its sides. Jeanine presumes it contains data from the city's founders and the means to end the Divergence problem. As only Divergents can open the box, she orders all of them to be captured. Divergent Beatrice \"Tris\" Prior, her boyfriend Four, brother Caleb, and Dauntless troublemaker Peter hide in the Amity compound led by Johanna Rayes. Eric tests the occupants for Divergence. Peter reveals their location as the others escape on a train to Factionless territory. Four discloses to the Factionless that his real name is Tobias Eaton, son of leader Evelyn, whom he resents for leaving him with abusive father Marcus. At the Factionless compound, Evelyn proposes a Dauntless-Factionless alliance against Erudite, but Four declines. The following day, the three leave for Candor to meet up with the remaining Dauntless who were given shelter there, including Tori and Tris's best friend, Christina. During the trek, a disheartened Caleb splits from the group. Upon arrival, Tris and Four are arrested and brought before Candor leader Jack Kang, who intends to deliver them to Jeanine. However, Four pleads for a trial using Candor's truth serum. The serum reveals the real events, and they are absolved, but Tris tearfully admits to killing Christina's lover, Will, which angers her. The Dauntless, aligned with Jeanine, attack Candor, injuring many with metal disks. Max and Eric capture Tris, revealing she has a Divergent reading of 100%, making her ideal for opening the box. Four saves Tris and kills Eric for his crimes. Meanwhile, Jeanine, frustrated by the failed Divergent subjects in the simulations, is approached by Peter, who suggests exploiting Tris's selfless Abnegation upbringing to reach her. Back at the Factionless base, Four reluctantly agrees with Evelyn that war is inevitable. Jeanine activates the disks, a mind control device that causes Christina and her friends Marlene and Hector to walk robotically towards a ledge and ask for Tris's surrender. Tris and Tori manage to grab Christina and Hector in time, but Marlene plunges to her death. Overcome by guilt, Tris decides to turn herself over to Jeanine. At the Erudite headquarters, Tris threatens to kill herself rather than comply, but she is stopped by the presence of Caleb, who is fully committed to Erudite. Tris agrees to undergo the trials if the suicides cease. Under Jeanine, Caleb, and Peter's watch, Tris overcomes the first four simulations before she requires rest. The next day, after discovering that Four was captured while he tried to rescue her, Tris fails the Amity trial, and her vital signs cease, shocking Jeanine. Peter takes her body to Four, reveals he faked her death, and assists him in overpowering the guards. Tris is now determined to unveil the box's message, so with Peter's help, they return to the simulation room. She successfully opens the box in front of everyone. A hologram explains that the walled city and the faction system were part of an experiment, with the Divergents as its ultimate goal. The world is waiting outside for them to rejoin it. Realizing she has lost, Jeanine orders the box buried and Four and Tris executed. However, the Factionless burst in, incapacitate Max, and rescue them. Jeanine and Caleb are arrested, and the message is broadcast citywide. Celebrated as a hero, Tris is eager to explore the outside world. In her cell, Jeanine wonders about life beyond the wall. Evelyn tells her she will never know and kills her.",

    "plot": "In a dystopian 2045, people seek to escape from reality through the OASIS (Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation), a virtual reality entertainment universe created by James Halliday and Ogden Morrow of Gregarious Games. After Halliday's death, a pre-recorded message left by his avatar Anorak announces a contest, granting ownership of the OASIS to the first to find the golden Easter egg within it, which gets locked behind a gate requiring three keys which players can obtain by accomplishing three challenges. The contest has lured several \"Gunters\", or egg hunters, and the interest of Nolan Sorrento, the CEO of Innovative Online Industries (IOI) who seeks to control the OASIS himself by inserting intrusive online advertising. IOI uses an army of indentured servants, and employees called \"Sixers\" to find the egg. Wade Watts, an avid orphaned Columbus, Ohio-based Gunter using the avatar Parzival, participates in the first challenge, an unbeatable race, along with his best friend Aech, and Art3mis, a female avatar whom Parzival has a crush on. Parzival regularly visits Halliday's Journals, a simulated archive of Halliday's life and hobbies, run by the Curator. Wade receives the Copper Key from Anorak after he wins by driving backward, while Art3mis, Aech, and his friends Daito and Sho, all win the race afterward, later being collectively named the High-5 on the OASIS' scoreboard. Sorrento asks the mercenary i-R0k to learn Wade's true identity, intended of bribing him to win the contest on IOI's behalf. Wade and Art3mis discover from the Journals that Halliday once dated Morrow's wife Karen \"Kira\" Underwood. Wade and Art3mis visit the Distracted Globe night club to look for clues, where Wade confesses his love and true name to Art3mis. They survive an IOI raid in which Art3mis abandons Wade, explaining that her father died in debt to IOI. i-R0k, who was eavesdropping on their conversation, informs Sorrento of his findings. Sorrento contacts Wade with his offer. When rejected, Sorrento attempts to kill Wade by bombing his home, killing Wade's aunt Alice and her abusive boyfriend Rick among others. Art3mis' player Samantha Cook takes Wade in. Together, they realize the second challenge relates to Halliday's regret of not pursuing a relationship with Kira. Along with Aech, Daito, and Sho, Parzival and Art3mis search for the Overlook Hotel's recreation. Art3mis asks Kira to dance and wins the Jade Key. Sorrento's subordinate F'Nale Zandor storms the Gunters' hideout, taking Samantha to an IOI Loyalty Center to pay off her father's debt. Wade escapes with the help of the other High-5 users, Helen Harris (Aech), Toshiro (Daito), and Zhou (Sho) in Helen's truck. Samantha escapes confinement after hacking Sorrento's OASIS rig. The third challenge is found in Castle Anorak on Planet Doom, where players must guess Halliday's favorite Atari 2600 game to earn the Crystal Key. iR0k places a forcefield around the castle using the Orb of Osuvox, but Art3mis can disable it. The High-5 lead an army of OASIS players against the Sixers. Sorrento fights back but Aech, Daito, and Art3mis destroy his avatar. Parzival destroys Samantha's avatar, allowing her to flee IOI while the High-5 picks her up, and reaches the console, but Sorrento detonates the Cataclyst bomb, wiping out every avatar on Planet Doom including himself. Parzival survives using an extra life coin given to him earlier by the Curator in a bet. He plays the 1980 game Adventure, winning the Crystal Key by locating Warren Robinett's Easter egg. He uses the three keys to enter a treasure room, where Anorak offers him a contract to sign. Parzival recognizes it as the one Morrow signed when Halliday forced him out of Gregarious Games and refuses to sign it. Anorak transforms into Halliday, who expresses his regrets in life, handing over the Easter egg. The bombing results the arrests of Sorrento and F'Nale. Ogden Morrow appears, revealing he is the Curator. Wade decides to run the OASIS with the High-5, inviting Morrow to join them as a consultant. As the IOI Loyalty Centers shut down, the High-5 make the controversial choice to close the OASIS every Tuesday and Thursday, so people can spend more time in the real world.",

    "plot": "Two years after the Battle of Sokovia, Thor is imprisoned by the fire demon Surtur, who reveals that Thor's father Odin is no longer on Asgard. He explains that the realm will soon be destroyed during the prophesied apocalypse Ragnarök, once Surtur unites his crown with the Eternal Flame that burns in Odin's vault. Thor frees himself, defeats Surtur, and takes his crown, believing he has prevented Ragnarök. Thor returns to Asgard to find Heimdall gone and his estranged brother Loki posing as Odin. He forces Loki to help find their father, who Loki put a spell on after his presumed sacrifice years before. With directions from Stephen Strange, they find Odin in Norway. Unpossessed, Odin explains that he is dying, Ragnarök is imminent despite Thor's efforts, and his death will free his firstborn child, Hela, from Hel, a prison she was sealed in long ago. Hela, a sibling Thor and Loki did not know existed, was the leader of Asgard's armies and conquered the Nine Realms with Odin, but he imprisoned her and wrote her out of history after she became too bloodthirsty and did not share his views on peace. Odin dies, and Hela appears after being freed from her prison. She destroys Thor's hammer Mjolnir, and pursues the two as they attempt to flee through the Bifröst Bridge, knocking them out into space. Arriving in Asgard, Hela defeats its army, slays the Warriors Three, and resurrects the ancient dead who once fought with her, including her giant wolf Fenris. She appoints the Asgardian Skurge as her executioner. Hela plans to use the Bifröst to expand Asgard's empire, but Heimdall takes the sword that controls the Bifröst. Meanwhile, Thor crash-lands on Sakaar, a garbage planet surrounded by wormholes. A slave trader designated Scrapper 142 subdues him with an obedience disk and sells him as a gladiator to Sakaar's ruler, the Grandmaster, with whom Loki has already ingratiated himself. Thor recognizes 142 as a Valkyrie, one of a legendary force of female warriors who were killed fighting Hela eons ago. Thor is forced to compete in the Grandmaster's Contest of Champions, facing his friend Hulk. Summoning lightning, Thor gets the upper hand, but the Grandmaster sabotages the fight to ensure Hulk's victory. Still enslaved after the fight, Thor attempts to convince Hulk and 142 to help him save Asgard, but neither is willing. Thor finds the Quinjet that brought Hulk to Sakaar. Hulk inadvertently destroys the Quinjet, but a recording of Natasha Romanoff causes Hulk to transform back into Bruce Banner for the first time since leaving Sokovia. 142 decides to help Thor save Asgard. Loki helps them steal one of the Grandmaster's ships. They liberate the other gladiators who, incited by two aliens named Korg and Miek, stage a revolution. Loki again attempts to betray his brother, but Thor anticipates this and incapacitates him. Thor, Banner, and 142 escape through a wormhole to Asgard, where Hela's forces attack Heimdall and the Asgardian citizens. Hulk defeats Fenris; Loki and the gladiators arrive to help, and a repentant Skurge sacrifices himself to save the citizens. Thor, battling Hela, loses his right eye and has a vision of Odin that helps him realize only Ragnarök can stop her, as she is too powerful. He sends Loki to trigger Ragnarök by placing Surtur's crown in the Eternal Flame. Surtur is reborn and destroys Asgard, killing Hela. Aboard the Grandmaster's spaceship, the Statesman, Thor, now king, reconciles with Loki and decides to take his people to Earth. In a mid-credits scene, they are intercepted by a large spacecraft. In a post-credits scene, the overthrown Grandmaster is confronted by his former subjects.",

    "plot": "On April 3, 2005, the NDR series robot \"Andrew\" is introduced into the Martin family home to perform housekeeping and maintenance duties and introduces himself by showing a presentation of the Three Laws of Robotics. The eldest daughter Grace despises Andrew, but her younger sister Amanda is sympathetic to him, and Andrew discovers he feels emotions, and is drawn to spend more time with his \"Little Miss\". He accidentally breaks one of her glass figurines and is able to carve a new one out of wood, which surprises her father Richard. Richard takes Andrew to NorthAm Robotics to inquire if Andrew's creativity was part of his programming. NorthAm's CEO Dennis Mansky claims this is a problem and offers to scrap Andrew, but instead Richard takes Andrew back home and encourages him to continue his creativity and explore other humanities. Andrew becomes a clockmaker and earns a sizable fortune managed by Richard after they find that robots have no rights under current laws. Time passes, and Richard encourages Dennis to retrofit Andrew with the ability to present facial expressions to match his emotions. About two decades after being awoken, Andrew presents Richard with all the money he has made to ask for his freedom. Wounded by this, Richard refuses, but grants Andrew his independence on the condition that he may no longer reside at the Martin home. Andrew builds his own home by the beach. In 2048, Richard is on his death bed, and apologizes to Andrew for banishing him all those years ago. Following Richard's death, Andrew goes on a quest to find other NDR robots that are like him, frequently communicating back to Amanda, who has since married and divorced, and has a son Lloyd and granddaughter Portia. In 2068, during his quest, Andrew discovers Galatea, an NDR robot that has been modified with a female personality and traits. Andrew becomes interested in how Galatea was modified by Rupert Burns, the son of the original NDR designer, and finds he has a number of potential ideas to help make robots appear more human-like. Andrew agrees to fund Rupert's work and to be a test subject and is soon given a human-like appearance. Andrew finally returns to the Martin home in 2088 and finds that Amanda has grown old while Portia looks much like her grandmother at her age. Portia is initially cautious of Andrew, but soon accepts him as part of the Martin family. When Amanda dies, Andrew realizes that all those he cares for will also pass on. He presents ideas to Rupert to create artificial organs that not only can be used in humans to prolong their lives but also to replace Andrew's mechanical workings. Andrew gains the ability to eat, feel emotions and sensations, and even have sexual relationships, resulting in him and Portia falling in love. Andrew petitions the World Congress to recognize him as a human as to allow him to marry Portia, but the body expresses concern that an immortal human will cause jealousy from others. Andrew returns to Rupert for one last operation: to change the artificial fluids driving his body into a blood equivalent. Rupert cautions him that the blood will not last forever, causing his body to age and will die eventually, a fate Andrew accepts. Several decades afterwards, a now visibly aged Andrew again approaches the World Congress, with Portia as support, to appeal their past decision, wanting to be able to die with dignity. On April 2, 2205, with Andrew's body deteriorating, he and Portia are both under life support monitored by Galatea, now with a human appearance. They hold hands and watch the World Congress as they recognize Andrew as a human being, the world's oldest at 200 years, and giving all rights confirmed by that, including validating his marriage to Portia. Andrew dies during the broadcast, which is confirmed by Galatea while Portia asserts that Andrew already knew the answer. After ordering Galatea to turn off her life support, Portia soon dies, hand-in-hand with Andrew as she whispers to him \"See you soon\".",

    "title": "Free Guy",
    "plot": "Free City is an online game developed by Soonami Studios. Its \"players\"—people in real life—wear sunglasses and spend their time fighting each other and causing mayhem. The non-player characters (NPCs) accept the chaos while living out their scripted lives, unaware that the world they live in is a video game. These NPCs include Guy, who works as a clerk in Free City's bank with his best friend, security guard Buddy. Unemployed software developer Millie Rusk plays Free City to find proof that Soonami stole the source code from the concept game she developed, Life Itself, which included novel artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for its NPCs. Her friend and co-developer Walter \"Keys\" McKey is reluctant to help, as he now works in technical support at Soonami. Millie's avatar \"MolotovGirl\" catches Guy's attention by singing his favorite song, \"Fantasy\". Guy then begins to deviate from his programming, accidentally shooting a player robbing the bank, and leaving with the player's sunglasses. Believing Guy to be a hacker disguised as an NPC, Keys and his coworker Mouser unsuccessfully try to ban him from the game. Accessing the players' view of the game, Guy visits new areas and meets Millie at vlogger Revenjamin Buttons' stash house, where they attempt to steal evidence leading to her source code. Believing Guy to be a novice player, she advises him to level up. Guy rapidly progresses through the game by completing missions benevolently, standing out from other players and becoming a worldwide sensation known as \"Blue Shirt Guy\". As Keys realizes that Guy truly is an NPC, other NPCs that Guy interacts with also begin to develop self-awareness. However, Free City 2 is due to release in 48 hours and will replace Free City, terminating all of its NPCs. Millie tells Guy the truth about his existence, but he becomes distraught and breaks off contact. Guy eventually realizes that there is something more to an NPC's existence, and goes with Buddy to get the evidence Millie wanted from Buttons, who accidentally glitched through the edge of Free City's map and discovered an older build of Life Itself, recording a video clip in the process. Guy's popularity threatens the plans of Soonami's CEO Antwan Hovachelik to launch Free City 2, so he orders a server reboot which resets Guy's memories. Guy regains his self-awareness when Millie kisses him. Guy recalls the location of an island containing remnants of the Life Itself build and they attempt to reach it before the Free City 2 launch wipes all old content from the servers. Guy even rallies the NPCs who are now on strike from the game. Antwan fires Keys, has every player removed from Free City, and sends an unfinished but extremely powerful Guy-resembling character named Dude into the game to stop Guy. Initially overwhelmed, Guy then puts his sunglasses on Dude, distracting him, and proceeds to the island. Furious, Antwan begins smashing the game's network server racks with an axe in a last-ditch attempt to stop Guy, erasing Buddy and much of the game world, while firing Mouser after he soon realized that he did steal Millie's code. Before he can destroy the final server, Guy managed to reach the island and Millie offers a deal to drop the copyright infringement lawsuit and surrender the Free City franchise's profits to him in exchange for her creation. Antwan agrees to her terms, believing she made a bad deal. Sometime later, sales for Free City 2 slip because of bugs in the code and lagging online play. An embattled Antwan is in the crosshairs, but claims he is a victim of circumstance. Millie salvages her code and along with Keys and Mouser, releases the indie game Free Life, which includes Guy, Dude, and the other NPCs from Free City. Guy reveals to Millie that his code is actually a love letter to her from Keys: during the development of Life Itself, Keys had encoded what he knew about her tastes into an AI routine in the game, which was eventually incorporated into Free City, explaining why Guy felt drawn to MolotovGirl. After Millie leaves the game, she and Keys kiss. Meanwhile, Guy and Dude reunite with Buddy, whose AI algorithm was reconstructed.",

    "plot": "An extraterrestrial spacecraft deploys a shuttle to Earth. Sometime later, Alan \"Dutch\" Schaefer and his elite paramilitary rescue team—skilled mercenary Mac Eliot, explosives expert Poncho Ramirez, a macho Blain Cooper, an expert tracker Billy Sore, and a jokester Rick Hawkins—are tasked with rescuing a local cabinet minister whose helicopter was shot down in a Central American jungle. Dutch's Vietnam War ally, Al Dillon, now CIA officer, accompanies the team to oversee the mission. The team find the helicopter wreckage and traces of guerrilla soldiers, as well as three skinned corpses hung high in the trees nearby. Dutch identifies the corpses as Green Berets, and becomes suspicious of Dillon's intentions after learning the helicopter was outfitted for surveillance. Dutch's team attacks the guerrilla camp, killing the soldiers and their Russian military allies, and learning the hostages were CIA agents. Dillon admits the cabinet minister story was a lie to convince Dutch—who refuses to use his team for assassinations—to eliminate the camp and prevent a Soviet-sponsored invasion. Dillon also discloses that the original mission team disappeared and the Green Berets had been sent to find them. Dillon takes a surviving guerrilla, Anna, prisoner, and the team travels towards the extraction point. Unbeknownst to the team, a technologically advanced, humanoid predator has stalked them since their arrival, remaining invisible with a cloaking device, and using thermal imaging vision to see their body heat. Billy senses the presence of something inhuman, but cannot confirm his suspicions. Anna flees while the team are distracted, and although Hawkins catches her, he is killed by the predator while Anna is spared. While the team searches for Hawkins' body, the predator kills Blain. Mac glimpses the predator's cloaked form and, enraged at Blain's death, provokes the team into blindly firing their weapons into the jungle, wounding the predator. The team makes camp for the night, booby-trapping the perimeter. A wild boar triggers a trap, and the predator uses the ensuing confusion to steal Blain's corpse. The following day, Dutch deduces that the predator is stalking them from the treetops. Dutch releases Anna, needing her to work with them to survive. She recounts local folktales of a monster who kills men and takes trophies from their corpses, typically when the weather is hottest. The team booby-trap the treetops to force the predator into a net, but it is able to escape and Poncho is injured. Mac and Dillon, who wants to make amends to the team, pursue the predator, but they are outmaneuvered and killed. The predator soon catches the survivors, killing Billy and Poncho. Realizing the predator only attacks those it considers a threat, Dutch warns Anna to relinquish her weapon and run to the extraction point. Dutch distracts the predator before falling from a cliff into a waterfall and washing up on a muddy shore. The predator pursues Dutch, but is seemingly unable to see him, and leaves to collect the skulls of the others as trophies. Dutch concludes that the mud masked his body heat, making him invisible to the predator. Seeking to avenge his team, Dutch creates makeshift traps and weapons. As night falls, he covers himself in mud and yells to lure the predator to him. Dutch uses his invisibility to wound the predator and disable its cloaking device, but falls into a river which washes off his mud camouflage. Deeming Dutch a worthy opponent, the predator removes its weapons and mask—revealing a monstrous visage—to face him in hand-to-hand combat. Easily outmatched by the larger and stronger creature, Dutch attempts to goad it into a trapped tunnel, but the predator suspects his plan and circumvents it. Dutch triggers the trap himself, releasing its counterweight, which crushes the predator. Mortally wounded, the predator activates a wrist-mounted self-destruct device. Dutch flees, barely escaping the enormous resulting explosion that razes the area. As dawn breaks, the extraction helicopter arrives with Anna to collect the exhausted and traumatized Dutch.",

    "plot": "In 2012, the US economy's collapse and rising crime rates led to increased privatized prisons, including Terminal Island Penitentiary. Warden Claire Hennessey profits from broadcasting \"Death Race,\" where inmates race modified, armed cars on a trap-filled track to win their freedom. In 2020, during the final event, masked driver Frankenstein nears the finish, chased by rival Machine Gun Joe. His navigator, Case, says his weapons malfunctioned. Despite her protests, Frankenstein, close to freedom, refuses to let Joe win. Case ejects before Joe destroys the car with a rocket launcher, killing Frankenstein. Industrial worker and ex-con Jensen Ames struggles to support his family. When the steel mill he works at closes and a riot breaks out, he returns home to his wife, Suzy, and their newborn, Piper. A masked attacker knocks him out. Jensen wakes with a bloodied knife, Suzy dead nearby, and police arrest him. Framed for murder, he's sentenced to life, and Piper goes into foster care. Six months later, Jensen is transferred to Terminal Island Prison. Warden Hennessey's second-in-command, Ulrich, calls Jensen to her office. Hennessey reveals that Frankenstein had died from his injuries and offers Jensen freedom in exchange for standing in for Frankenstein at one event. Jensen accepts the offer and meets Frankenstein's crew, which consists of prison volunteer Coach, fellow inmates Gunner, and Lists. They suspect Hennessey wants him to become the new Frankenstein to regain audience and profits, which have dwindled since Frankenstein's absence. On the first day of the three-day event, Jensen meets his navigator, Case. During the race, his vehicle's defensive equipment malfunctions again. Jensen sees Pachenko make the same gesture as the masked assailant and realizes Pachenko killed his wife. Distracted, Jensen is blindsided by Joe and finishes last. After the race, Jensen attacks Pachenko, who admits Hennessey ordered him to frame Jensen to replace Frankenstein. Ulrich then incapacitates Jensen before he can kill Pachenko. On the second day, Jensen threatens to eject Case unless she explains the truth about the malfunctions. Case admits she was offered release papers in exchange for sabotaging Frankenstein's car to keep him from winning. Jensen tricks Pachenko into slamming his car into a concrete barrier and then kills him by snapping his neck. Hennessey releases the \"Dreadnought\", a multi-weapon tanker, to make races exciting. After it massacres most racers, Jensen and Joe destroy it by luring it into a trap, enraging Hennessey. The day ends with Jensen and Joe as the only survivors. Aware that Jensen knows it was she who set him up, Hennessey orders Ulrich to plant a bomb underneath Jensen's car. She offers Jensen rewards to keep racing as Frankenstein, which he rejects. Jensen approaches Joe and proposes cooperation. In the final race, Hennessey manipulates the track to weaken Jensen's offensive and defensive abilities, allowing Joe to chip away at his armor. Joe misses with a rocket at Jensen, destroying part of the wall they both drive through, revealing their escape plan. They reach the mainland bridge. Hennessey and Ulrich, seeing Joe and Jensen fleeing, shut down the Death Race livestream and send patrol cruisers after them, also disabling their vehicle weapons. Hennessey tries to activate the bomb, but Coach has already deactivated and removed it. Hennessey's helicopters pursue Jensen to a railway depot, where he jumps out of the car as Case takes his place, wearing a Frankenstein mask. While the pursuers catch Case, Joe and Jensen escape on a freight train. Hennessey is pleased with the ratings and opens a present, revealing the bomb meant for Jensen. Coach remotely detonates the bomb, killing Hennessey and Ulrich. Six months later, Joe and Jensen are mechanics in Mexico, with Piper in Jensen's custody. They reunite with Case, who won a muscle car in a card game, and stays with them.",

    "plot": "Thousands of years ago, five African tribes warred over a meteorite containing the metal vibranium. One warrior ingests a \"heart-shaped herb\" affected by the metal and gains superhuman abilities, becoming the first \"Black Panther\". He unites all but the Jabari Tribe to form the nation of Wakanda. Over centuries, the Wakandans use vibranium to develop advanced technologies and isolate themselves from the world by posing as an underdeveloped country. In 1992, Wakanda king T'Chaka visits his brother N'Jobu, who is working undercover in Oakland, California. T'Chaka accuses N'Jobu of assisting black-market arms dealer Ulysses Klaue with stealing vibranium from Wakanda. N'Jobu's partner reveals he is Zuri, another undercover Wakandan, and confirms T'Chaka's suspicions. In the present day, following T'Chaka's death, his son T'Challa returns to Wakanda to assume the throne. He and Okoye, leader of the Dora Milaje, extract T'Challa's ex-lover Nakia from an undercover assignment so she can attend his coronation ceremony with his mother Ramonda and younger sister Shuri. At the ceremony, the Jabari Tribe's leader M'Baku challenges T'Challa for the crown in ritual combat without the benefit of the heart-shaped herb. T'Challa defeats M'Baku when he persuades him to yield rather than die. When Klaue and his accomplice Erik Stevens steal a Wakandan artifact from a London museum, T'Challa's friend and Okoye's husband W'Kabi urges him to bring Klaue back alive. T'Challa, Okoye, and Nakia travel to Busan, South Korea, where Klaue plans to sell the artifact to CIA agent Everett K. Ross. A firefight erupts, and Klaue attempts to flee but is caught by T'Challa, who reluctantly releases him to Ross's custody. Klaue tells Ross that Wakanda's international image is a front for a technologically advanced civilization. When Erik attacks to extract Klaue, Ross is gravely injured protecting Nakia. Rather than pursue Klaue, T'Challa takes Ross to Wakanda, where their technology can save him. While Shuri tends to Ross, T'Challa confronts Zuri about N'Jobu, since Erik wore a necklace that belonged to him. Zuri explains that N'Jobu had become disillusioned with Wakanda's isolationism and planned to share Wakanda's technology with people of African descent to help them overcome their oppressors, with Klaue's assistance. Before T'Chaka could apprehend N'Jobu, N'Jobu attacked Zuri, forcing T'Chaka to kill him. T'Chaka instructed Zuri to claim that N'Jobu had vanished and to leave behind N'Jobu's American son, N'Jadaka, to uphold the story. This boy grew up to become Erik, a U.S. black ops Navy SEAL who took on the nickname \"Killmonger.\" Meanwhile, Killmonger kills Klaue and brings his body to Wakanda. He is presented before the tribal elders, revealing himself as N'Jadaka and asserting his claim to the throne. Killmonger challenges T'Challa to ritual combat and kills Zuri; without the powers of the heart-shaped herb, T'Challa is severely injured and presumed dead after Killmonger throws him over a waterfall. Killmonger ingests the heart-shaped herb and orders the rest to be incinerated, but Nakia manages to extract one. Killmonger, backed by W'Kabi and his army, prepares to distribute shipments of Wakandan weapons to operatives worldwide. Nakia, Shuri, Ramonda, and Ross flee to the Jabari Tribe for aid. They find a comatose T'Challa, rescued by the Jabari as repayment for sparing M'Baku's life. Healed by Nakia's herb, T'Challa returns to fight Killmonger, who also dons a nanotech suit similar to T'Challa's. W'Kabi and his army fight Shuri, Nakia, and the Dora Milaje while Ross remotely pilots a jet and shoots down the planes carrying vibranium weapons before they can leave Wakanda. M'Baku and the Jabari arrive to reinforce T'Challa. Confronted by Okoye, W'Kabi and his army stand down. Fighting in Wakanda's vibranium mine, T'Challa disrupts Killmonger's suit and stabs him. Killmonger refuses to be healed, choosing to die as a free man rather than be incarcerated; T'Challa shows him the Wakanda sunset, and Killmonger dies peacefully. T'Challa establishes an outreach center at the building where N'Jobu died, to be run by Nakia and Shuri. In a mid-credits scene, T'Challa appears before the United Nations to reveal Wakanda's true nature to the world. In a post-credits scene, Shuri helps Bucky Barnes with his rehabilitation.",

    "plot": "Linguist Louise Banks's daughter Hannah dies at the age of twelve from an incurable illness. Twelve extraterrestrial spacecraft hover over various locations around the Earth. In the ensuing widespread panic, affected nations send military and scientific experts to monitor and study them. In the United States, US Army Colonel Weber recruits Banks and physicist Ian Donnelly to study the craft above Montana. On board, Banks and Donnelly make contact with two cephalopod-like, seven-limbed aliens, whom they call \"heptapods\"; Donnelly nicknames them Abbott and Costello. Banks and Donnelly research the complex written language of the heptapods, consisting of phrases written with logograms, and share the results with other nations. As Banks studies the language, she starts to have flashback-like visions of her daughter. When Banks is able to establish sufficient shared vocabulary to ask why the heptapods have come, they answer with a statement that could be translated as \"offer weapon\". China interprets this as \"use weapon\", prompting them to break off communications, and other nations follow. Banks argues that the symbol interpreted as \"weapon\" can be more abstractly related to the concepts of \"means\" or \"tool\"; China's translation likely results from interacting with the heptapods using mahjong, a highly competitive game. Meanwhile, the Russian team receives a message that they translate as \"there is no time,\" which they interpret as a possible threat. Rogue soldiers plant a bomb in the Montana craft. Unaware, Banks and Donnelly reenter the alien vessel, and the aliens give them a more complex message. Just before the bomb explodes, one of the aliens ejects Donnelly and Banks from the vessel, knocking them unconscious. When they wake, the heptapod craft has moved beyond reach and the US military is preparing to evacuate in case of retaliation. General Shang of China issues an ultimatum to the alien craft in China, demanding that it leave within 24 hours. Russia, Pakistan, and Sudan follow suit; communications between the international research teams are terminated as worldwide panic sets in. Donnelly discovers that the symbol for time is present throughout the message and that the writing occupies exactly one-twelfth of the 3D space into which it is projected. Banks suggests that the full message is split between the twelve craft and that the heptapods want all the nations to collaborate in order to decipher it. Banks goes alone to the Montana craft, which sends down a transport pod. Abbott has been mortally injured as a result of the explosion. Costello explains that they have come to help humanity, because in 3,000 years' time they will need humanity's help in return. Banks realizes the \"weapon\" is their language. Learning the language alters humans' linear perception of time, allowing them to experience memories of future events. Banks's visions of her daughter are revealed to be premonitions; her daughter will not be born until sometime in the future. Banks returns to the camp as it is being evacuated and tells Donnelly that the aliens' language is the \"tool\" that was meant by the word \"weapon\". She has a premonition of a United Nations event celebrating global unity achieved by deciphering the heptapods' language. At the event, General Shang thanks Banks for persuading him to stop the attack when she called his private number and recited his wife's dying words. He then shows her his private number and whispers his wife's words into her ear. In the present, Banks takes CIA agent Halpern's satellite phone from a table and calls Shang's private number to recite the words. The Chinese announce that they are standing down and releasing their twelfth of the message. The other countries follow suit, and the twelve spacecraft depart. From what she has learned, Banks writes and publishes a book called The Universal Language, a guide to the heptapod language, which will eventually teach humanity to perceive time the same way as the heptapods. During the evacuation, Donnelly expresses his love for Banks. They talk about their life choices and whether he would change them if he could see his life from beginning to end. Banks knows that she will agree to have a child with him despite knowing their fate: that Hannah will die from an incurable disease and that Donnelly will leave them both as a result of her revealing that she knew this.",

    "plot": "In 1991, the brainwashed super-soldier James \"Bucky\" Barnes is dispatched from a Hydra base in Siberia to intercept an automobile carrying a case of super-soldier serum. In the present day, approximately one year after Ultron is defeated by the Avengers in the nation of Sokovia, Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Sam Wilson, and Wanda Maximoff stop Brock Rumlow from stealing a biological weapon from a lab in Lagos. Rumlow blows himself up, attempting to kill Rogers. Maximoff telekinetically diverts the explosion, accidentally destroying a nearby building and killing several Wakandan humanitarian workers in the process. Thaddeus Ross, the U.S. Secretary of State, informs the Avengers that the United Nations (UN) is preparing to pass the Sokovia Accords, which will establish a UN panel to oversee and control the team. The Avengers are divided: Tony Stark supports oversight because of his role in Ultron's creation and Sokovia's devastation, while Rogers has more faith in his own judgment than that of politicians. Meanwhile, Helmut Zemo tracks down and kills Barnes' old Hydra handler, stealing a book containing the trigger words that activate Barnes' brainwashing. At a UN conference in Vienna where the Accords are to be ratified, a bomb kills King T'Chaka of Wakanda. Security footage indicates the bomber is Barnes, whom T'Chaka's son, T'Challa, vows to kill. Informed by Sharon Carter of Barnes' whereabouts and the authorities' intentions to kill him, Rogers decides to try to bring in Barnes—his childhood friend and war comrade—himself. Rogers and Wilson track Barnes to Bucharest and attempt to protect him from T'Challa and the authorities, but all four, including T'Challa, are apprehended by the Bucharest police and James Rhodes. Impersonating a psychiatrist sent to interview Barnes, Zemo recites the words to activate Barnes's brainwashing. He questions Barnes, then sends him on a rampage to cover his own escape. Rogers stops Barnes and sneaks him away. When Barnes regains his senses, he explains that Zemo is the real Vienna bomber and wanted the location of the Siberian Hydra base, where other brainwashed \"Winter Soldiers\" are kept in cryogenic stasis. Unwilling to wait for authorization to apprehend Zemo, Rogers and Wilson go rogue, and recruit Maximoff, Clint Barton, and Scott Lang to their cause. With Ross's permission, Stark assembles a team composed of Romanoff, T'Challa, Rhodes, Vision, and Peter Parker to capture the renegades. Stark's team intercepts Rogers' group at Leipzig/Halle Airport, where they fight until Romanoff allows Rogers and Barnes to escape. As Rogers and Barnes are escaping, Rhodes is inadvertently shot down by Vision, and becomes partially paralyzed. The rest of Rogers' team is captured and detained at the Raft prison, and Romanoff goes into exile. Stark discovers evidence that Barnes was framed by Zemo and convinces Wilson to give him Rogers' destination. Without informing Ross, Stark goes to the Siberian Hydra facility and strikes a truce with Rogers and Barnes, unaware that they were secretly followed by T'Challa. They find that the other super-soldiers have been killed by Zemo, who then shows them footage that reveals that the automobile Barnes had intercepted in 1991 contained Stark's parents, whom Barnes subsequently killed. Enraged that Rogers kept this from him, Stark turns on them both, leading to an intense fight, in which Stark destroys Barnes' robotic arm, and Rogers disables Stark's armor. Rogers departs with Barnes, leaving his shield behind. Satisfied that he has avenged his family's deaths in Sokovia from the Avengers' actions by successfully fracturing them, Zemo attempts suicide, but he is stopped by T'Challa and taken to the authorities. In the aftermath, Stark provides Rhodes with exoskeletal leg braces that allow him to walk again, while Rogers breaks his allies out of the Raft. In a mid-credits scene, Barnes, granted asylum in Wakanda, chooses to return to cryogenic sleep until a cure for his brainwashing is found. In a post-credits scene, Parker explores the features of the web shooters built for him by Stark.",

    "plot": "After the Mjolnir saved the crew of Nebuchadnezzar, Neo and Bane still lie unconscious in the ship's medical bay. Neo's consciousness is trapped in a subway station named Mobil Ave, a transition zone between the Matrix and the machine world. He meets a \"family\" of programs, including a girl named Sati. The \"father\" tells Neo the subway is controlled by the Trainman, a program loyal to the Merovingian. When Neo tries to board a train with the family, the Trainman refuses and overpowers him. Seraph contacts Morpheus and Trinity on behalf of the Oracle, who informs them of Neo's confinement. Seraph, Morpheus, and Trinity enter Club Hel, where they confront the Merovingian and force him to release Neo. Troubled by visions of the Machine City, Neo visits the Oracle, who reveals that Smith intends to destroy both the Matrix and the real world. She tells him \"everything that has a beginning has an end.\" After Neo leaves, a large group of Smiths assimilates Sati and Seraph. The Oracle does not resist assimilation, and Smith gains her powers of precognition. In the real world, the crews of the Nebuchadnezzar and the Mjolnir find and reactivate Niobe's ship, the Logos. They interrogate Bane, who says that he has no recollection of the earlier massacre. As the captains plan their defense of Zion, Neo requests a ship to travel to the Machine City. Motivated by her encounter with the Oracle, Niobe offers him the Logos. Neo departs, accompanied by Trinity. Bane, who has stowed away on the Logos, takes Trinity hostage. Neo realizes Smith has assimilated Bane, and a fight ensues. Bane burns Neo's eyes with a power cable, blinding him. Neo discovers he can still \"see\" machine source code in the real world and uses this ability to kill Bane. Trinity pilots them to the Machine City. Zion's shipyard is overwhelmed by a horde of Sentinels. Niobe and Morpheus rush toward Zion in the Mjolnir to aid the human defenses. The fatally wounded Captain Mifune instructs Kid to open the gate for the Mjolnir, which he does with the aid of Zee. When it arrives, it discharges its EMP, disabling all the Sentinels present but also Zion's remaining defenses. The humans are forced to retreat and wait for the next attack, thinking it will be their last stand. The Logos is besieged by machines guarding Machine City. Neo shuts several of them down using his newfound powers but passes out from exhaustion. To avoid their attackers, Trinity flies above them, briefly glimpsing the open sky before crashing into a building. Impaled by debris, Trinity declares her love for Neo before dying. Neo enters the Machine City and encounters the leadership of the machines in the form of the \"Deus Ex Machina.\" Neo warns that Smith threatens both the machine and human worlds. He offers to stop Smith in exchange for peace with Zion. The Deus Ex Machina agrees, and the Sentinels stop the attack on Zion. The machines plug Neo into the Matrix, whose population has now been entirely assimilated by Smith. The Smith with the Oracle's powers steps forth, telling Neo he has foreseen his own victory. After a protracted fight, Smith says \"everything that has a beginning has an end,\" repeating what the Oracle said to Neo. Neo appears to concede defeat and allows himself to be assimilated. Outside the Matrix, the machines send a surge of energy into Neo's body, which inside the Matrix causes the Neo-Smith clone, then all the other Smith clones, to be destroyed, killing Neo while restoring the Oracle and everyone else who was assimilated. The Sentinels withdraw from Zion, Morpheus and Niobe embrace, and the city rejoices. The machines carry Neo's body away. The Matrix is rebooted, and the Architect meets the Oracle in a park, scolding her for having \"played a dangerous game.\" They agree that the peace will last \"as long as it can\" and that those who desire to leave the Matrix will be allowed their freedom. The Oracle tells Sati that she thinks they will see Neo again. Seraph asks the Oracle if she knew this would happen. She replies that she did not know, but she believed.",

    "plot": "Three years before the events of the film, mysterious apex predators called Reapers emerged from sinkholes underground and began exterminating humanity, with 95% killed in the first month. Survivors live in pocketed communities 8,000 feet or more above sea level — elevations that the creatures do not venture into. Lost Gulch Refuge in Front Range, Colorado, is home to Will, a single father, and his son Hunter, who has a lung disease. Will is haunted by his wife Tara's death at the hands of Reapers during an expedition with Nina, a scientist, to discover the Reapers' weaknesses. After months of isolation, Hunter grows frustrated as neighboring communities conserve electricity by turning off radios and using flags to communicate. Will realizes he is running low on oxygen filters for Hunter. Despite Nina's warnings against going to Boulder, Colorado for more filters, Will persuades her to join him to reach her former lab and find a way to kill the Reapers. Will's friend Katie joins them, and they enter the Elba Fire Road that leads them to a mine below the safety line. Nina has a compass device she invented that can detect a nearby Reaper due to their high bioelectromagnetic pulses. They gather supplies along the way, including a grenade launcher, and follow the road leading them to a former ski area. A Reaper spots them, but Will turns on the ski lift's backup generators, allowing the group to narrowly escape the Reaper above the safety line. They rest at the old lodge, where Nina explains that the Reapers do not eat or sleep, theorizing that they are not biological creatures. The next morning, the group comes to a former mining tunnel Will knows from when he was a miner; however, the mines' lower levels dip below the safety line, and if they enter, Nina's compass will not warn them of nearby Reapers since it does not function underground. As they enter the mines, they find that the level above the safety line was welded shut during the initial invasion, forcing them to enter the lower levels. A Reaper then attacks the group, and its tendrils later drag Katie to her death. Nina and Will manage to escape and return to the surface above the safety line. Nina wants to return to her lab for her stockpile of magnesium oxide, hypothesizing that the Reaper's impenetrable scales produce magnetic defense mechanisms and if one of the bullets is laced with a magnesium mineral, it will penetrate and kill the creature through internal combustion. They proceed to Boulder and manage to find oxygen filters in an abandoned hospital. A Reaper attacks them, but Will shoots at gas canisters to stall it, giving them enough time to escape. Will wants to get back to his son, but Nina convinces him to help her return to her former laboratory at the U.S. Department of Energy. Will learns that Nina lost her family to a Reaper attack while she was at work. Nina lets Will go back to his son while she researches how to kill the creatures. While she experiments with lacing bullets with a cobalt/magnesium mixture, a Reaper attacks her. Will leaves in a pickup truck, but crashes, forcing him to run to the safety line while pursued by three Reapers. The Reapers corner him, but Nina arrives just in time, her successful experiment having allowed her to kill the Reaper that attacked her in the lab, and kills the Reapers with her Co/Mg-laced bullets, causing them to explode from internal combustion upon impact. They realize that the Reapers are not biological, but machines built using advanced alien technology, proving Nina's theory correct. They return to Lost Gulch and Will reunites with Hunter. Nina raises a pirate flag for other nearby communities in the Rocky Mountains, signifying a Reaper has been killed. The communities resume radio contact and start arming themselves with Co/Mg-coated bullets to fight against the Reapers. Sometime later, Nina looks through a telescope with Will at her side as three greenish meteorites enter orbit.",

Yon-Rogg, her mentor and commander, trains Vers to control her abilities, while the Supreme Intelligence, the artificial intelligence that rules the Kree, urges her to keep her emotions in check. During a mission to rescue an undercover operative infiltrating a group of Skrulls, alien shapeshifters with whom the Kree are at war, Vers is captured by Skrull commander Talos. A probe of Vers's memories leads them to Earth. Vers escapes and crash-lands in Los Angeles. Her presence attracts S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Nick Fury and Phil Coulson, whose investigation is interrupted by a Skrull attack. Vers recovers a crystal containing her extracted memories in the ensuing chase while Fury kills a Skrull impersonating Coulson. Talos, disguised as Fury's boss Keller, orders Fury to work with Vers and keep tabs on her. Using her extracted memories, Vers and Fury go to the Project Pegasus installation at a former U.S. Air Force base. They discover that Vers is a human pilot who was presumed to have died in 1989 while testing an experimental light-speed engine designed by Dr. Wendy Lawson, whom Vers recognizes as the woman from her nightmares. Fury informs S.H.I.E.L.D. of their location and a team arrives. When he realizes that Keller is Talos, Fury helps Vers escape in a prototype jet with Lawson's stowaway cat, Goose. They fly to Louisiana to meet former pilot Maria Rambeau, the last person to see Vers and Lawson alive. Rambeau and her daughter Monica reveal that Vers is Carol Danvers, who was once like family to them. Talos, arriving unarmed, says the Skrulls are refugees searching for a new home to escape the Kree's unjust war and Lawson was Mar-Vell, a renegade Kree scientist helping them. Talos plays a recovered blackbox recording from Lawson's jet, prompting Danvers to remember the crash: Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell to prevent her from destroying the engine before the Kree could recover it. Danvers destroyed the engine herself and absorbed its energy, gaining powers but losing her memory. Danvers, Talos, Fury, and Rambeau locate Lawson's cloaked laboratory orbiting Earth, where Lawson hid several Skrulls, including Talos's family, and the Tesseract, the power source of Lawson's engine. Danvers is captured by Starforce and interfaces with the Supreme Intelligence. Danvers removes a Kree implant that has been suppressing her powers, allowing her to reach her full potential. In the subsequent battle, Fury retrieves Goose, who is revealed to be an alien Flerken. Goose swallows the Tesseract and scratches Fury, blinding his left eye. Danvers destroys a Kree bomber, forcing Kree officer Ronan the Accuser and his squadron to retreat. Danvers overpowers Yon-Rogg and sends him to Hala with a warning for the Supreme Intelligence. She then departs to help the Skrulls find a new homeworld, leaving Fury a modified pager to contact her in an emergency. After experiencing extraterrestrial threats, Fury drafts an initiative to locate more heroes like Danvers, naming it after her Air Force call sign \"Avenger\". In a mid-credits scene set in 2018, the pager has been activated and is being monitored by the Avengers when Danvers appears looking for Fury.

He flies from Seattle to visit her parents in Chicago, intending to ask her father Tom for permission to marry Sam. At dinner, Tom and Will get into an argument, and Will leaves without mentioning the pregnancy or wedding. The next day, Sam calls Will before his flight back. She becomes scared when she hears a strange sound, and says, \"Something's wrong,\" before the line goes dead. At the airport, all flights are cancelled. There is a TV news report discussing preliminary reports on a seismic event off the West Coast of the US that has disrupted electrical power and telecommunication. Will returns to Sam's parents', where Tom and Will agree to drive together to Seattle to find Sam. Amidst heavy traffic, Will and Tom find soldiers have closed off the interstate. Invoking his prior service as a Marine officer, Tom persuades them to let his car through. That night, they are pulled over by a police car, but the driver is an escaped inmate from the local maximum security prison, armed with a shotgun. The ensuing firefight results in an accident that fractures Tom's ribs. Tom knocks him out, and they use the police cruiser to tow their damaged car to a nearby reservation. At the reservation, mechanic Ricki fixes the car and agrees to travel with them in case they break down again. The trio set out, restocking provisions as they go. At one point, robbers hold the trio at gunpoint, stealing their gasoline reserves. Without fuel they are doomed, so Will chases and catches up with the fleeing car. Ricki shoots out their tires, causing the vehicle to flip over. With the surrounding fire and the crashed car's leaking gas tank, they barely have enough time to take their gasoline back before the car explodes. Later that night, upset over what happened, Ricki leaves them. The next day Tom's lung collapses, so Will has to perform a needle thoracostomy. Sensing Tom will die without medical help, they bond, and Will finally feels that Tom approves of him and Sam. On a bridge, they encounter a gang of armed men on motorcycles. They work together to evade the gang, but Tom succumbs to his wounds. The car breaks down, and Will burns it so he does not have to leave Tom's body to rot. Will continues the journey on foot. A family picks Will up, and he leads them to his estranged father's empty house in Idaho where they all rest. He strikes a deal with them, taking their four wheel drive vehicle in exchange for them staying at his father's well-stocked house until they are ready to go north, where the situation is supposedly better. As he gets closer to Seattle, Will sees that it is almost completely destroyed. The mystery thickens as Will notices dead victims buried in their cars under a thick layer of ash. Finally reaching Sam's devastated apartment, Will sees Sam's message for him, with an address to a cabin. At the cabin, Will finds Sam with Jeremiah, a neighbor from the apartment building. Convinced the disaster is not natural but the result of an elaborate attack, Jeremiah reveals a deep paranoia. The next morning, he tries to kill Will, having fallen in love with Sam. Will shoots him in self-defense. Soon after, a volcanic eruption triggers a massive burst of fire, ash and shockwaves, causing a pyroclastic flow. Will and Sam speed away from the all-engulfing cloud, barely staying ahead of it but managing to out-distance it as it subsides. They proclaim their love for one another, regardless of what happens next, as they, too, head north. The cause and nature of the original 'event' are unexplained.",

In 2012, three years after the outbreak, U.S. Army virologist LTC Robert Neville lives an isolated life in deserted Manhattan in a heavily fortified Washington Square Park home. Neville's daily routine includes experimenting on infected rats to find a cure for the virus, searching for food and supplies, and waiting each day for any survivors who might respond to his continuous recorded radio broadcasts, which instruct them to meet him at midday at the South Street Seaport. Neville's only companion is his German Shepherd, Samantha (Sam), and to cope with his loneliness, he regularly \"talks\" to mannequins and the characters on film recordings from video stores. At night, he barricades himself with Sam inside to hide from the Darkseekers. Neville is haunted by memories of his wife, Zoe, and daughter, Marley, who died in a helicopter accident during the chaotic evacuation of Manhattan under quarantine, while Neville himself stayed behind with other military personnel. One day, while Neville hunts a deer, Sam pursues it into a dark building infested with the Darkseekers. Neville cautiously follows and finds the deer's carcass with Sam, but are chased by the Darkseekers; they escape unharmed. Neville finds a promising blood-derived treatment, sets a trap, and captures a female Darkseeker. An alpha Darkseeker tries to pursue them but is halted by sunlight. Neville treats the female in his basement lab but seems unsuccessful. The next day, Neville sees 'Fred,\" a mannequin outside Grand Central Terminal, and realizes he's being watched by the Darkseekers. As he approaches Fred, he's caught in a trap like the one used to capture the female, hitting his head and losing consciousness. When he wakes, the sun is setting, and the Alpha unleashed infected dogs to attack him. Neville and Sam kill the dogs, but Sam is bitten. Neville injects her with his serum, but when she shows signs of infection, he strangles her. Grieving, Neville attacks the Darkseekers the next night before being rescued by Anna and Ethan, who came from Maryland after hearing his broadcast. They take Neville home, where Anna explains they survived the outbreak on a Red Cross ship from São Paulo and are heading to a survivors' camp in Bethel, Vermont. Neville disagrees, saying no such camp exists. While working to cure the female Darkseeker, Neville suggests cooling her with ice to improve treatment. The next night, Darkseekers who tracked them the previous night, attack the house. Neville, Anna, and Ethan retreat to the basement laboratory, sealing themselves with the female test subject. As the Darkseekers attack the lab, discovering the last treatment was successful, Neville assesses the situation as the Darkseeker alpha male rams himself against a glass door to break in. Neville draws a vial of blood from the woman he cured and gives it to Anna before shutting Ethan and her inside a coal chute in the back of the lab. Neville then kills both himself and the attacking Darkseekers with a grenade. The next day, Anna and Ethan reach the survivor camp in Bethel, greeted by other survivors before Anna gives them the cure. Anna recounts Neville's efforts and sacrifices to save humanity.",

    "plot": "In Swellview, scientists at Evil Science Corp successfully manufacture a device called the Reality Altering Device (R.A.D.). During its transportation to a secure vault, the guards fail to notice a Kid Danger toy strategically placed in a nearby window. Within moments of securing the R.A.D., an infiltrator disguised as Kid Danger - Missy Martin, a devoted Kid Danger fan - steals the device. Pursued by several guards, Missy skillfully evades and incapacitates them, escaping with the R.A.D. Back at her home, adorned with memorabilia of the superhero, she prepares to use the R.A.D. to bring Kid Danger back to life. Unbeknownst to her, Henry Hart, the real Kid Danger, had faked his death and moved to Dystopia to fight crime alongside Jasper Dunlop, who had honed unique skills such as fighting in his sleep and speaking Spanish. Meanwhile in Dystopia, Jasper assures Detective Jones that Henry will soon arrive, attempting to flirt with her before Piper Hart and Schwoz Schwartz interrupt. They are visiting to support Henry after Charlotte Page's departure for Harvard. Embarrassed by their attempts to help his romantic prospects, Jasper warns them of an imminent attack by the supervillain Blackout who seeks to steal plutonium from a truck to destroy Dystopia's nuclear core. When the city is plunged into darkness, Henry abandons a public event to intervene. Schwoz hacks into surveillance to locate the truck, while Jasper, using his techno-band, fights Blackout in an alley. Henry joins the fray, countering Blackout's attacks and ultimately defeating him in a public display, much to the delight of his fans. However, a dispute with Jasper over recognition and fame leads to a heated argument, straining their friendship. Back at his building, Henry discovers that Blackout has defaced his posters in anger. Simultaneously, Missy activates the R.A.D., bringing her fan-fiction The Adventures of Kid Danger & Superfan, to life. She transports Henry into her room, where he finds himself wearing an upgraded Kid Danger suit. Overwhelmed, Henry questions Missy's motives. She confesses her desire to bring him back to fight the rising crime in Newtown, inspired by a traumatic mugging incident. Henry, however, admits that he had faked his death to start fresh in Dystopia, leaving Missy both shocked and thrilled. Despite Missy's pleas to team up as vigilantes, Henry declines, insisting on returning to Dystopia. As they debate, a fictional villain, Coach Cregg, from Missy's stories appears and attacks a woman. Henry reluctantly intervenes but is overpowered, realizing that Missy's fan-fiction has altered his abilities. Missy saves him using the R.A.D., but their troubles escalate when Vampiper, a electrokinetic vampire version of Missy created out of spite when she was kicked out of the Kid Danger fan club, arrives, intent on obtaining the device. A narrow escape leads Henry and Missy to another reality, this time an '80s-themed nightclub, where they encounter alternate versions of Frankini, Piper, and Jasper (who operates as Captain Stache). Henry discovers that the R.A.D. has locked them into \"story mode,\" forcing them to travel through Missy's fanfiction realities to escape. In an apocalyptic setting, Henry and Missy encounter a survivalist Jasper variant who helps them fend off Canadian Mounties. Together, they use clever tactics to defeat the attackers, further deepening Henry's appreciation for his real-world friendship with Jasper. The group then seeks the help of Post-Apocalyptic Schwoz, who explains that they need the crystal that is now in Vampiper's possession, to restore their original reality. Though initially blaming herself for the chaos, Missy finds encouragement in Henry's support, prompting her to continue the fight. Determined, the team prepares to face Vampiper in Newtown. Back in Newtown, Vampiper has captured Missy's sister Gemma as a hostage. Despite setbacks, including Coach Cregg's whistle incapacitating the team, Henry and Missy launch a daring rescue mission. Inside the house, Henry battles Vampiper, while Missy heroically sacrifices herself to secure the crystal, urging Henry to complete their mission. Although Vampiper summons reinforcements like Fangkini, Henry manages to pass the crystal to Post-Apocalyptic Schwoz, who prepares to restore reality. The final confrontation sees Henry, Jasper, and Schwoz battling Vampiper and her minions. Despite overwhelming odds, Post-Apocalyptic Schwoz successfully inserts the crystal into the R.A.D., reversing the chaos and restoring order. Missy and Henry reconcile, with Henry acknowledging her bravery and growth. As the realities collapse back into place with the alternate Frankini returned to his reality, Henry returns to Dystopia with a renewed appreciation for his friends, while Missy vows to continue making a difference in Newtown, inspired by her brief partnership with Kid Danger. Reconciling with Jasper, Henry hears that Blackout is attacking again. He and Jasper managed to defeat Blackout as he allows Jasper to take the credit for Blackout's defeat as he gets a date with Detective Jones. After going to a show with Schwoz and Piper, Henry visits Newtown the next day with Jasper and Schwoz as they drive off two punks that were bothering Missy. Henry invites her to be his sidekick which she accepts as they head to their new Headquarters. Sometime later, Henry and Missy arrive at the scene of a crime where they find Captain Man defeating some drones. He tells Henry that he needs his help. During the credits, the alternate Frankini is seen performing in the 80s-themed nightclub.",

    "title": "The Prestige",
    "plot": "In 1890s London, up-and-coming magicians Robert Angier and Alfred Borden both work as stagehands and plants for an older magician, Milton, under the mentorship of Milton's ingénieur John Cutter, while Angier's wife Julia works as Milton's assistant. Borden is a technical magician, skilled in the art of creating tricks that confound other magicians while Angier's talent lies in presentation and thrilling audiences with his showmanship. The men become bitter rivals after Julia drowns during an onstage incident. Borden, who was responsible for tying the knots in the water tank trick, claims to not know whether he tied a riskier type of knot that night, infuriating Angier. They go their separate ways, with Angier hiring Cutter to help with his act. Cutter employs Olivia, a new assistant with whom Angier starts a relationship. Meanwhile, Borden meets and marries Sarah before hiring an unknown ingénieur called Bernard Fallon to help with his career as a magician, specifically his masterpiece trick that he had mentioned to Cutter earlier, claiming no one else can do it. Sarah becomes pregnant soon after and they welcome a daughter, Jess. As their careers start to take off, Angier and Borden take turns sabotaging each other, escalating their feud. While trying to perform his bullet catch trick, Borden and Fallon fail to recognise a disguised Angier who volunteers to fire the gun and shoots him with a real bullet, causing Borden to lose two fingers. Angier loses his stage contract after Borden sabotages his cage trick on the opening night, causing one of Angier's spectators to break her fingers. Angier visits Borden's show again intending payback, but comes away surprised by Borden's debut of a new trick called the Transported Man, in which he appears to teleport from a cabinet at one end of the stage to another cabinet on the opposite side. Angier is determined to find out Borden's secret for the trick, but creates a new version of it for his own act, the New Transported Man, using a lookalike named Root, as suggested by Cutter. Despite the new version being better received, Angier is unsatisfied by being the man \"in the box\" and not receiving the audience's acclaim at the end of the trick — Root is the one that receives all the applause while Angier must remain hidden under the stage and remains obsessed over Borden's secret. Angier cajoles Olivia to work for Borden and spy on him to find out his secret for performing the Transported Man, but this results in Olivia's alienation from Angier, and eventually Olivia becomes Borden's mistress instead. Using Olivia's inside knowledge of Angier's method, Borden exposes Root to the audience and causes Angier to break a leg, further infuriating him. Borden, with Olivia's help, improves the presentation of his own act, now called the Original Transported Man, and his success continues. After obtaining Borden's encoded diary from Olivia and burying Fallon alive to force Borden to reveal his secret, Angier receives the cipher to the diary, TESLA, which Borden tells him is also his method for doing the trick. However, this is really a fabrication meant to drive Angier away. Angier arrives at Colorado Springs to meet the scientist Nikola Tesla, himself engaged in a bitter rivalry with scientist Thomas Edison. Angier asks Tesla to build a machine that transports its subject, believing Tesla has already created such a device for Borden. The enigmatic Tesla agrees and, after some problems with getting it to work as intended, eventually creates the machine, but gravely warns against its use, telling Angier it will only bring him misery. Angier nevertheless returns to London with the machine and uses it to perform the Real Transported Man, a refined version of the trick that brings him unprecedented recognition. Borden's personal life becomes more complex, having to juggle his responsibilities to daughter Jess and wife Sarah (who senses he is keeping something from her), his affair with Olivia and his magic career, especially after Angier's return and increasing acclaim for the Real Transported Man trick. Unable to live with Borden's secretive nature, Sarah commits suicide, causing Olivia to leave him when she sees Borden react coldly. Borden becomes obsessed with finding out how Angier is performing the Real Transported Man. Angier's method confounds both Borden and Fallon, their only clue being that Angier uses a trap door. Borden sneaks under the stage at one of Angier's shows to discover the method, but is shocked to see Angier drown inside a water tank. Borden is arrested and put on trial for Angier's apparent murder. He is found guilty and sentenced to death. A solicitor named Owens, acting for a Lord Caldlow, meets Borden and offers him money in return for the method of how he performed the Transported Man. Owens also informs Borden that Jess will be taken away from Fallon's guardianship and sent to a workhouse unless he agrees, assuring him Jess will instead be placed in the care of the wealthy Caldlow who has purchased many of Angier's belongings as souvenirs. When Borden demands to see Jess before revealing his secret, Lord Caldlow visits Borden in person with Jess in tow. To Borden's horror, the aristocratic Caldlow reveals himself as the true identity behind Angier, having reverted to his original life as a wealthy Lord following the \"death\" of Angier, which Borden is accused of. He taunts Borden over being a better magician and that he will adopt Jess. Borden gives up his secret at the prison, only to see his note torn up, unread by Angier. Fallon is the last person to visit Borden at the prison before he is executed. Cutter inadvertently discovers Angier's true identity as Caldlow and is reluctantly enlisted to help destroy Tesla's machine at a theater Angier secretly owns. After Cutter leaves, a mysterious figure sneaks into the theater and shoots Angier. The figure is Borden, and a dying Angier finally learns the truth: Alfred Borden was a single identity shared by twin brothers; while one performed, the other hid in plain sight as Fallon, both alternating between the two. To remain indistinguishable, one twin was even forced to mutilate his hand after Angier sabotaged Borden's bullet catch and shot off two of his fingers. They both lived one half of Alfred Borden's life, never appearing in public as twins, except during the Transported Man, where they would switch identities. One twin married Sarah, while the other loved Olivia, with only Sarah sensing the deception, thus driving her to suicide. The brother who fathered Jess survived as Fallon while the other was executed as Borden. Angier, in his last moments, reveals the true gravity of Tesla's machine: although it was successful in transporting the subject, it also kept the original intact — a glitch in the machine that Tesla was unable to resolve. Thus a new Angier was created every time he used the machine. Angier built a trap door to drop the man in the machine into a water tank positioned below stage, drowning him. As he dies, Angier knocks over an oil lamp, starting a fire in the theater as Borden walks away. At Borden's workshop, Cutter explains to Jess that the hardest and final part of any magic trick is the re-appearance, also called the \"prestige,\" where the magician brings back the object he made to vanish. As he demonstrates this, Borden reappears at the workshop to take Jess back into his care. The film ends with a shot of Angier's burning theater, the walls lined with water tanks containing the corpses of his clones.",

    "title": "Sonic the Hedgehog",
    "plot": "Sonic, a young anthropomorphic blue hedgehog who can run at supersonic speed, is ambushed by an echidna tribe for his power. His guardian, an anthropomorphic owl named Longclaw, gives him a bag of golden rings that open portals to distant locations. She tells Sonic the best way to stay safe is to stay hidden before using a ring to send him to Earth while she stays behind to hold off the echidnas, sacrificing herself. Ten years later, Sonic enjoys a secret life in a forest cave near under the rural town of Green Hills, Montana, but longs to make friends. He idolizes the local sheriff, Tom Wachowski, and his wife, Maddie, unaware that the pair plans to relocate to San Francisco as Tom intends to accept a job at the San Francisco Police Department. One night, Sonic grows sad over his loneliness while playing baseball alone. While he is running at unusually high speeds to clear his mind, his frustration over his isolation boils over, causing him to accidentally trigger an electromagnetic pulse that causes a massive power outage across the Pacific Northwest. The U.S. Department of Defense enlists the services of eccentric roboticist and scientific genius Dr. Robotnik to determine the cause of the outage. Realizing his cover has been blown, Sonic reluctantly plans to leave Earth and live on a different planet that only contains mushrooms. Robotnik discovers Sonic's footprint in the forest and, determining that the print is not of any animal found on Earth, uses his drones to track Sonic, who escapes his cave and hides in the Wachowskis' shed to leave for the mushroom planet. However, Sonic causes a commotion as he prepares to leave, causing Tom to investigate. Discovering Sonic in his shed, Tom shoots him with a tranquilizer dart, causing Sonic to accidentally open a portal to San Francisco and drop his bag of rings through the portal to the Transamerica Pyramid's roof before passing out. After Sonic recovers, Tom agrees to help him, and the two flee when confronted by Robotnik, who falsely labels Tom a domestic terrorist. The two bond as they make their way to San Francisco, with Tom relating to Sonic's desire for friends. Sonic creates a bucket list in a western-themed bar where Tom helps him complete several entries, culminating in a bar fight. Meanwhile, Robotnik comes across one of Sonic's quills, discovering that the power in it has the potential to fuel his machines, and becomes obsessed with capturing Sonic to harness his power. Sonic and Tom fight off several mechanized drones sent by Robotnik, but Sonic is injured. Arriving in San Francisco, Tom brings Sonic to Maddie, who is staying at her sister Rachel's house, to revive him. While Tom explains the situation to Maddie, Sonic receives a new pair of sneakers from Maddie's niece Jojo. Sonic, Tom, and Maddie then head to the roof of the Transamerica Pyramid and recover the rings as Robotnik arrives in an advanced hovercraft powered by the quill. Sonic fights off Robotnik's drones and sends Tom and Maddie back to Green Hills with one of his rings; however, Robotnik uses the quill's power to match Sonic's speed and pursues him across the world, incapacitating him in Green Hills. Tom and the townsfolk intervene, and Tom acknowledges Sonic as his friend, causing Sonic to regain consciousness and maximum strength. Sonic defeats Robotnik by destroying his hovercraft with his powerful spin attack and, with help from Tom, sends him through a ring portal to the mushroom planet. Following the incident, Tom and Maddie decide to stay in Green Hills and let Sonic live with them. Commander Walters, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, congratulates them for saving the world and assures them that all evidence of the event has been erased, including records of Robotnik's existence. Meanwhile, on the mushroom planet, Robotnik, having lost his sanity and still in possession of Sonic's quill and equipment salvaged from the remains of his hovercraft, plots his return to Earth to seek his revenge. On Earth, Tails emerges from a ring portal in search of Sonic.",

    "plot": "One year following the Battle of Crait, the resurrected Emperor Palpatine sends a message of revenge to the galaxy. Hunting him down, Kylo Ren obtains a Sith wayfinder that leads him to the hidden planet Exegol, in the unknown regions of the galaxy. There, he finds Palpatine, who reveals himself as the power behind Snoke and the First Order. Palpatine unveils a Sith armada of Star Destroyers and offers it to Kylo if he finds and kills Rey, who is continuing her Jedi training under Resistance leader Leia Organa. Poe Dameron and Finn deliver intelligence from a spy in the First Order that Palpatine is on Exegol; Rey reads in Luke Skywalker's notes that a Sith wayfinder can lead them there. Rey, Finn, Poe, Chewbacca, BB-8, and C-3PO depart in the Millennium Falcon to the desert planet Pasaana, where a clue to a wayfinder is hidden. Kylo initiates a Force bond with Rey to discover her location. He travels to Pasaana with his warrior subordinates, the Knights of Ren. With Lando Calrissian's help, Rey and her friends find the clue—a dagger inscribed with Sith text, which C-3PO's programming forbids him from interpreting—and the remains of a Sith assassin named Ochi and his ship, which Rey recognizes. Rey senses Kylo nearby and faces him while the First Order captures the Falcon, Chewbacca, and the dagger. Attempting to save Chewbacca, Rey accidentally destroys a First Order transport with Force lightning. Believing Chewbacca is dead, the group escapes on Ochi's ship. They travel to Kijimi, where the droidsmith Babu Frik extracts the Sith text from C-3PO's memory, revealing the wayfinder's coordinates. Rey senses Chewbacca is alive and aboard Kylo's Star Destroyer, so the group stages a rescue with the smuggler Zorii Bliss' help. Rey recovers the dagger but experiences repressed memories of her parents' deaths. Rey duels Kylo, who reveals that Palpatine is her paternal grandfather. Foreseeing her power, Palpatine had ordered Ochi to find the young Rey, but her parents hid her on Jakku, prompting Ochi to kill them with the dagger. To spite Kylo, General Hux saves Poe, Finn, and Chewbacca from execution, revealing himself as the spy. Rey and her friends escape, while Hux is executed by Allegiant General Pryde. The group flies the Falcon to the wayfinder's coordinates on a moon in the Endor system. There, they find renegade stormtroopers led by Jannah, whom they recruit to the Resistance. Rey retrieves the wayfinder from the wreckage of the second Death Star, but she is met by Kylo, who destroys the wayfinder and duels her. In a dying act, Leia distracts Kylo through the Force, and Rey impales him. Sensing Leia's death and overcome by guilt, Rey heals Kylo and takes his TIE fighter to exile herself on Ahch-To. Meanwhile, Kylo converses with a memory of his father, Han Solo. He discards his lightsaber and reclaims his identity as Ben Solo. Palpatine deploys the Sith fleet to draw Rey out and sends a Sith Star Destroyer to destroy Kijimi. On Ahch-To, Luke's Force spirit encourages Rey to face Palpatine and gives her Leia's lightsaber. Rey leaves for Exegol in Luke's X-wing fighter, using the wayfinder from Ben's ship. Rey transmits her coordinates to R2-D2, allowing the Resistance, now led by Poe and Finn, to follow her to Exegol. There, she confronts Palpatine. Debilitated, he demands that she kill him in anger so his spirit can possess her body. The Resistance attacks the Sith fleet, while Ben overpowers the Knights of Ren and joins Rey. Palpatine senses their power as \"a dyad in the Force\" and drains it to rejuvenate his body. Lando arrives with reinforcements from across the galaxy, including Babu and Zorii. Palpatine incapacitates Ben and attacks the Resistance fleet with Force lightning. Weakened, Rey hears the voices of past Jedi, who give her strength. Palpatine attacks her with lightning, but Rey deflects it using Luke and Leia's lightsabers, destroying him before dying herself. A wounded Ben uses his remaining Force powers to revive Rey, sacrificing himself, but they kiss before he dies. The Resistance destroys the remaining Sith forces, while people across the galaxy rise up against the First Order. As the Resistance celebrates their victory, Rey visits Luke's abandoned homestead on Tatooine and buries Luke and Leia's lightsabers. A passerby asks her name; seeing Luke and Leia's Force spirits nearby, she responds, \"Rey Skywalker\".",

    "plot": "In 1997, Los Angeles is experiencing a heat wave and a turf war between heavily armed Colombian and Jamaican drug cartels. A Predator watches a shootout between the police, Jamaicans, and Colombians, observing as Lieutenant Michael R. Harrigan charges into the firefight to rescue two wounded officers and drive the Colombians back into their hideout. The Predator assaults the Colombians, causing a disturbance that prompts Harrigan and detectives Leona Cantrell and Danny Archuleta to defy orders and enter the hideout, where they find the slaughtered Colombians. On the roof, the crazed gang leader gets a glimpse of the Predator and shoots at it before falling to his death after Harrigan shoots him, but the latter dismisses it as a mirage due to extreme heat and his acrophobia. At the station, his superiors reprimand Harrigan for his disobedience. He is then introduced to Special Agent Peter Keyes, the leader of a task force investigating the cartels, and Detective Jerry Lambert, the newest member of Harrigan's team. Later that evening, Jamaicans invade the Colombian drug lord's penthouse and murder him before they are killed in turn by the Predator. Upon their arrival, Harrigan's team notes the similarities between the crime scene and the earlier Colombian massacre, including the flayed corpses, until Keyes's team arrives and removes them. Archuleta returns alone, finding one of the Predator's spear tips before the creature kills him. As an enraged Harrigan vows to stop Archuleta's killer, forensic analysis reveals the spear tip is not composed of any known element on the periodic table. Seeking answers, Harrigan meets with Jamaican drug lord King Willie, a voodoo practitioner who believes the killer is supernatural and that he should prepare himself for battle against it. Harrigan leaves before the Predator kills King Willie, taking his head as a trophy. Tracing a lead indicating Archuleta's killer had recently been in a slaughterhouse, Harrigan arranges to meet his team at the warehouse district to investigate. Cantrell and Lambert take the subway there, but are ambushed by the Predator, who kills Lambert and numerous armed passengers but spares Cantrell after its helmet's scanners indicate that she is pregnant. Arriving in time to see it claim Lambert's head, Harrigan chases the fleeing Predator, but Keyes's men intercept him. Keyes reveals that the monster is an extraterrestrial hunter with infrared vision and active camouflage that has been hunting humans for sport, most recently one decade prior in Central America. Keyes and his team have set a trap in a nearby slaughterhouse, using thermally insulated suits with mounted ultraviolet lights and cryogenic weapons to capture it for study. However, the suspicious Predator, upon hearing their footsteps, uses its scanners to track, outmaneuver, and slaughter Keyes's men via their lights. Harrigan attacks and wounds the Predator, but it destroys his weapon. It prepares to finish him off before Keyes tries to freeze the creature, but the Predator kills Keyes by throwing a Smart Disc at him. The Predator then chases Harrigan to the roof, where they clash until they are left hanging from a ledge. The creature activates a self-destruct device on its forearm, which Harrigan severs with the disc, disarming it. The Predator enters an apartment, where it treats its wounds and flees. Harrigan pursues it to a spacecraft hidden underground and engages it in combat, ultimately killing the Predator with its disc. Just then, a small group of cloaked Predators arrives to collect their comrade's body. Their leader, an elder Predator, gives Harrigan an antique flintlock pistol that is engraved with \"Raphael Adolini 1715\" on a brass plate, as a reward for killing the Predator. As the ship takes off, Harrigan escapes to the surface and meets with Keyes' team. Despite their lost opportunity to capture the creature in the end, Harrigan privately muses that the Predators will return.",

Against Leia's orders, Poe Dameron leads a costly counterattack that destroys a First Order dreadnought. The remaining Resistance escapes into hyperspace, but the First Order uses a device to track them and attacks again. Kylo Ren hesitates to fire on the lead Resistance ship after sensing his mother Leia's presence on board, but his wingmen destroy the bridge, killing most of the Resistance's leaders. Leia is dragged into space but survives by using the Force. While Leia recovers, Vice-Admiral Holdo assumes command of the Resistance. Running low on fuel, the remaining fleet is pursued by the First Order. On Ahch-To, Rey attempts to recruit Luke Skywalker to the Resistance. Under self-imposed exile, Luke refuses to help, believing that the Jedi should end. After encouragement from R2-D2, he agrees to give Rey three lessons in the ways of the Force. During training, Rey and Kylo begin communicating through the Force, which puzzles them both. Kylo tells Rey that Luke feared his power; Luke confesses that he momentarily contemplated killing Kylo upon sensing that Snoke was corrupting him, which prompted Kylo to destroy Luke's new Jedi Order. Convinced that Kylo can be redeemed, Rey leaves Ahch-To. Luke prepares to burn the Jedi library but hesitates. The spirit of Luke's master Yoda appears and destroys the library by summoning a bolt of lightning. He encourages Luke to learn from his failure. Meanwhile, Poe entrusts Finn, mechanic Rose, and BB-8 with a secret mission to disable the First Order's tracking device. Maz Kanata directs them to the casino town of Canto Bight, where they meet the hacker DJ. Pursued by the local security, they escape Canto Bight with the help of stablehand children and racing animals they set free. Finn, Rose, and DJ infiltrate Snoke's flagship but are captured by Captain Phasma. Kylo brings Rey to Snoke, who reveals that he connected their minds to discover Luke's whereabouts. Holdo plans to evacuate the remaining members of the Resistance using small transport vessels. Believing her plan cowardly and futile, Poe leads a mutiny. A recovered Leia stuns Poe with a blaster and proceeds with the evacuation. Holdo remains aboard the ship as a decoy to mislead Snoke's fleet as the others flee to an abandoned base on Crait. DJ buys his freedom by revealing the Resistance's plan to General Hux, and the First Order fleet begins firing on the evacuation transports, destroying many. Ordered to kill Rey, Kylo instead kills Snoke and defeats his Praetorian Guard with her help. Rey hopes that Kylo has abandoned the dark side, but he instead asks her to rule the galaxy with him. Refusing, she battles him for control of Luke's lightsaber, bisecting the weapon. Holdo sacrifices herself by slicing through Snoke's flagship at lightspeed, crippling the First Order fleet. Rey escapes the destruction while Kylo declares himself Supreme Leader. BB-8 frees Finn and Rose; they fight and defeat Phasma and join the survivors on Crait. When the First Order arrives, Poe, Finn, and Rose attack with obsolete speeders. Rey and Chewbacca draw TIE fighters away in the Millennium Falcon, while Rose stops Finn from sacrificing himself. The First Order penetrates the Resistance fortress using a siege cannon. Luke appears and confronts the First Order, allowing the surviving Resistance to escape. Kylo orders the First Order's forces to fire on Luke, but they fail to harm him. He then engages Luke in a lightsaber duel; upon striking Luke, Kylo realizes that Luke is not physically present but projecting his image through the Force. Rey helps the remaining Resistance escape on the Falcon. Exhausted, Luke dies peacefully on Ahch-To, becoming one with the Force. Rey and Leia sense his death, and Leia tells Rey that the Resistance can rise again. At Canto Bight, the stablehands recount the story of Luke Skywalker; afterward, one of them moves a broom with the Force and gazes into space.",

    "title": "The Purge",
    "plot": "In 2014, following an economic collapse in the United States, a political party called the \"New Founding Fathers of America\" is voted into office. It creates an annual 12-hour \"Purge,\" during which all crime using a \"Class 4\" weapon or lower is legal and emergency services are unavailable. By 2022, the economy is booming, with unemployment having fallen to 1% and crime to an all-time low. Many commentators attribute these successes to the Purge, although some note that the Purge mostly impacts the poor and marginalized. In 2022, security systems salesman James Sandin returns to his home in an affluent Los Angeles gated community to wait out the Purge with his wife, Mary, and their two children, 15-year-old Zoey and 11-year-old Charlie. During a family dinner, James announces that he is now the top salesman in his company. He assures them that his company's upgraded security system, which he has also sold to multiple neighbors, will protect them during the Purge. As an extra precaution, James retrieves a pistol from a gun safe. Charlie objects to the impending violence of the Purge, but James explains that it has rid the country of poverty and crime by giving people an outlet for their pent-up anger. Shortly before the Purge begins at 7 p.m., James enables the security system, which seals the doors and windows with metal plating. Returning to her room, Zoey is surprised by her older boyfriend Henry, who sneaked inside before James activated the security system. Henry tells Zoey that he has come to confront her father over his disapproval of their relationship. On the security monitors, Charlie sees a wounded stranger outside their home, desperately calling for help. He disables the security system to allow the man inside, but James re-engages the system and holds the man at gunpoint. Henry comes downstairs with a pistol and tries to shoot James, but James returns fire and mortally wounds Henry, who later dies on Zoey's bedroom floor. During the chaos, the stranger disappears. On the surveillance cameras, the family sees a gang of masked, armed youths on their lawn. The gang leader addresses the Sandins through their front-door camera, demanding that they turn over the stranger, whom they wish to execute during the Purge. He threatens to kill the family if they refuse. James admits that the security system, while superficially impressive, cannot resist a systematic assault. The Sandins capture the stranger to hand him over but decide to defend him and themselves instead. After the gang breaks in, James kills several members but is fatally stabbed by the leader. The Sandins' neighbors intervene, killing the gang members and rescuing Mary, who has been restrained by two Purgers. Zoey kills the gang leader, while James dies from his wounds. Mary begins to thank the neighbors for saving them, but their leader, Grace Ferrin, reveals that the neighbors hate the Sandins because they have become wealthy at their expense. The neighbors capture the Sandins and prepare to kill them, but the stranger returns, kills a neighbor, and holds Grace hostage to force the Sandins' release. Mary stops him from killing the others, avoiding more violence, and decides to wait peacefully for the Purge to end. Next morning, Grace tries to take control, but Mary breaks her nose with a shotgun butt and slams her face into a table, telling her again that there will be no more killing. As sirens sound at 7 a.m. to signal the end of the Purge, Mary forces her former friends to leave and thanks the stranger for his help. Television news reports the most successful Purge ever. Other reports say the stock market is booming due to weapons and security sales. A man's voice describes losing his patriotism after his sons' death the previous night.",

    "title": "Dredd",
    "plot": "The future United States is a dystopic irradiated wasteland known as the Cursed Earth. On the east coast lies Mega-City One, a violent metropolis with 800 million residents and 17,000 serious crimes reported daily. The only force for order are the Judges, who act as judge, jury, and executioner. The Chief Judge tasks veteran officer Judge Dredd with assessing potential recruit Cassandra Anderson, who marginally failed the aptitude tests to become a Judge, believing her powerful psychic abilities can help in the Judges' failing war against crime. Dredd warns Anderson that disobedience, incorrect sentencing, or being disarmed will result in an automatic fail. In a 200-storey slum tower block called Peach Trees, drug lord Madeline \"Ma-Ma\" Madrigal has three rogue drug dealers skinned and infused with Slo-Mo—an addictive new drug that reduces the user's perception of time to 1% of normal—before throwing them down the atrium from the top floor. Dredd and Anderson arrive to investigate the deaths and learn of the existence of Ma-Ma's drug den. Deciding to raid the den, they arrest Ma-Ma's henchman Kay, whom Anderson psychically detects was involved in the executions, and Dredd decides to take him in for questioning. In response, Ma-Ma's forces seize the tower's security control room and seal the building using its nuclear blast shields to prevent the Judges from leaving or summoning help. Ma-Ma instructs the residents to kill the Judges or hide, forcing Dredd and Anderson to confront dozens of armed thugs. They reach the seventy-sixth floor where Ma-Ma and her men launch an assault with rotary cannons that tear apart the walls and kill numerous residents, although the Judges evade harm. Dredd and Anderson breach an exterior wall and summon backup. Angered by the innocent deaths caused during Ma-Ma's assault, Dredd beats Kay for information, deducing she is desperate to prevent him from being interrogated. Anderson intervenes and psychically torments Kay into revealing that Peach Trees is the center of Slo-Mo production and distribution. Although Anderson recommends waiting for backup to arrive, Dredd insists on pursuing Ma-Ma. A pair of armed teens confront the Judges and, while they are distracted, Kay frees himself and disarms Anderson, capturing and taking her by elevator to Ma-Ma's base on the top floor. Meanwhile, Judges Volt and Guthrie arrive to support Dredd, but Ma-Ma's computer expert convinces them that the blast doors are malfunctioning and cannot be opened. While Dredd works his way toward Ma-Ma, she calls in the corrupt Judges Lex, Kaplan, Chan, and Alvarez, who enter the building. Kay tries to execute Anderson with her Lawgiver gun, but the DNA scanner does not recognize him and the gun explodes, destroying his arm before Anderson neutralizes him. Anderson escapes and kills Kaplan after reading her mind. Dredd, realizing the reinforcements are corrupt, initiates a firefight which kills Chan and Alvarez. Lex corners and wounds Dredd, before being fatally shot by Anderson. Anderson obtains the access code to Ma-Ma's apartment from the mind of her computer expert and releases him after viewing his memories of torture and coercion at Ma-Ma's hands. Dredd admonishes her decision to release a suspect as a fail point and a crime. Anderson, in response, reminds him she already failed the assessment by being disarmed, and considers the computer expert a victim. The Judges infiltrate Ma-Ma's apartment where they kill most of her enforcers, although Anderson is shot and wounded. Ma-Ma reveals that, if Dredd kills her, a device on her wrist will detonate explosives on the top floors, destroying the building. Reasoning that the detonator's signal will not reach the explosives from the ground floor, Dredd forces Ma-Ma to inhale Slo-Mo and throws her down the atrium to her death. With order restored, the Judges leave Peach Trees as reinforcements arrive. Dredd tells Anderson her assessment is complete and she surrenders her badge before leaving. The Chief Judge asks Dredd about Anderson's performance; he responds that she has passed.",

    "plot": "In the small town of Millbrook, New York, the Abbott family — parents Evelyn and Lee, daughter Regan, who is deaf, and sons Marcus and Beau — attend a Little League baseball game. A meteor-like object is seen hurtling toward Earth. Soon after, hostile alien creatures emerge and begin attacking. The blind creatures possess armored skin, incredible speed and strength, and an acute sense of hearing, attacking anything that makes noise. Over a year later, the aliens have killed much of Earth's population, including Lee and Beau. Regan discovers that high-frequency audio disrupts the aliens and modifies her cochlear implant to emit the signal via a handheld microphone. With their home destroyed, the surviving Abbotts set out in search of other survivors. While entering a fenced-off area, Evelyn accidentally activates a sound alarm. Marcus steps into a bear trap and screams, attracting an alien. Regan and Evelyn kill it, free Marcus, and take shelter in an abandoned steel foundry. They encounter Emmett, a former friend who has lost his family and lives alone in a soundproof bunker. He reluctantly allows them to stay but refuses further help. Marcus hears the song \"Beyond the Sea\" playing repeatedly on a radio station. Regan interprets the signal as a message from survivors living on the nearby Norwalk Islands. She theorizes that if she can reach the island's radio tower, she can broadcast the high-frequency signal as a weapon. Regan sets out alone but is attacked by an alien. Emmett rescues her and eventually agrees to help complete her mission. Evelyn leaves the foundry to retrieve medical supplies, leaving Marcus and the baby behind. While exploring, Marcus finds the decaying body of Emmett's wife. Startled, he makes noise, drawing an alien. He hides with the baby inside an air-tight compartment, risking suffocation. Emmett and Regan reach a marina, where they are ambushed by hostile looters. Emmett intentionally draws aliens to the scene, which kill the attackers. One creature drowns, revealing that the aliens cannot swim. Emmett and Regan escape in a boat and reach the island, where a small colony of survivors lives in relative safety. The colony's leader explains that when the U.S. government discovered the creatures could not swim, the National Guard attempted evacuations to the islands. However, chaos during boarding attracted the aliens, and only two of twelve boats made it. Meanwhile, Evelyn returns to the foundry and rescues Marcus and the baby. The family hides in the bunker as an alien enters the facility. The next day, an alien reaches the island on a drifting boat and attacks the colonists, killing the leader. Regan and Emmett flee to the island's radio station. Regan transmits the high-frequency signal over the radio, incapacitating the alien, then kills it using a metal rod. Back at the foundry, Marcus hears the broadcast and plays the signal through a portable radio, weakening the alien inside before shooting it. Regan leaves her cochlear implant connected to the radio station microphone, enabling the signal to be broadcast for use by other survivors.",

    "title": "The Thing",
    "plot": "In Antarctica, a Norwegian helicopter pursues a sled dog to an American research station. The Americans witness the passenger accidentally blow up the helicopter in addition to himself. The pilot fires a rifle and shouts at the Americans, but they cannot understand him and he is shot dead in self-defense by station commander Garry. The American helicopter pilot, R. J. MacReady, and Dr. Copper leave to investigate the Norwegian base. Among the charred ruins and frozen corpses, they find the burnt corpse of a malformed humanoid, which they transfer to the American station. Their biologist, Blair, autopsies the remains and finds a normal set of human organs. Clark kennels the sled dog, and it soon metamorphoses and absorbs several of the station dogs. This disturbance alerts the team, and Childs uses a flamethrower to incinerate the creature. Blair autopsies the Dog-Thing and surmises it is an organism that can perfectly imitate other life forms. Data recovered from the Norwegian base leads the Americans to a large excavation site containing a partially buried alien spacecraft, which Norris estimates has been buried for over a hundred thousand years, and a smaller, human-sized dig site. Blair grows paranoid after running a computer simulation that indicates the creature could assimilate all life on Earth in a matter of years. The group implements controls to reduce the risk of assimilation. The remains of the malformed humanoid assimilate an isolated Bennings, but Windows interrupts the process and MacReady burns the Bennings-Thing. The team also imprisons Blair in a tool shed after he sabotages all the vehicles, kills the remaining sled dogs, and destroys the radio to prevent escape. Copper suggests testing for infection by comparing the crew's blood against uncontaminated blood held in storage, but after learning the blood stores have been destroyed, the men lose faith in Garry's leadership, and MacReady takes command. He, Windows, and Nauls find Fuchs' burnt corpse and surmise he committed suicide to avoid assimilation. Windows returns to base while MacReady and Nauls investigate MacReady's shack. During their return, Nauls abandons MacReady in a snowstorm, believing he has been assimilated after finding his torn clothes in the shack. The team debates whether to allow MacReady inside, but he breaks in and holds the group at bay with dynamite. During the encounter, Norris appears to suffer a heart attack. As Copper attempts to defibrillate Norris, his chest transforms into a large mouth and bites off Copper's arms, killing him. MacReady incinerates the Norris-Thing, but its head detaches and attempts to escape before also being burnt. MacReady hypothesizes that the Norris-Thing demonstrated that every part of the Thing is an individual life-form with its own survival instinct. He proposes testing blood samples from each survivor with a heated piece of wire and has each man restrained, but is forced to kill Clark after he lunges at MacReady with a scalpel. Everyone passes the test except Palmer, whose blood recoils from the heat. Exposed, the Palmer-Thing transforms, breaks free of its bonds, and infects Windows, forcing MacReady to incinerate them both. Childs is left on guard in the main building while MacReady, Garry, and Nauls go to test Blair. They find that he has escaped and has been using vehicle components to assemble a small flying saucer, which they destroy. Upon their return, Childs is missing, and the power generator has been destroyed, leaving the men without heat. MacReady speculates that, with no escape left, the Thing intends to return to hibernation until a rescue team arrives. The three men agree that the Thing cannot be allowed to escape and set explosives to destroy the station, but the Blair-Thing kills Garry, and Nauls disappears. The Blair-Thing transforms into an enormous creature and breaks the detonator, but MacReady triggers the explosives with a stick of dynamite, destroying the station and the Blair-Thing. While MacReady sits by the burning remnants, Childs returns, claiming he got lost in the storm while pursuing Blair. Exhausted and slowly freezing to death, they acknowledge the futility of their distrust and share a bottle of J&B Scotch whisky.",

    "title": "Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials",
    "plot": "In a flashback, a woman leaves her son, Thomas, with the scientist Ava Paige and armed operatives from the World Catastrophe Killzone Department (WCKD) to ensure his survival. Thomas, along with other children, is eventually placed in a confined maze they later call the \"Glade\" as part of WCKD's scientific trials to study immunity to the Flare virus. Years later, shortly after escaping the maze, Thomas and the surviving Gladers are brought to a facility managed by Mr. Janson. Janson presents the facility as a haven protecting them from the \"Cranks\", humans who have been infected and driven mad by the Flare virus. While recovering, the group learns that their maze was not the only one constructed; other young survivors from separate trials are also present. Suspicious of Janson, Thomas teams up with Aris, a survivor from a different maze who was the first to arrive at the facility, to investigate. He discovers that Ava Paige is still alive and overseeing WCKD's operations, and that Janson is working for them. He later overhears them discussing ongoing experiments on Immunes, survivors of the maze trials naturally resistant to the Flare virus, as well as an active search for the Right Arm resistance group based in the mountains. The Gladers and Aris rescue Teresa, who had been held separately, and escape the facility into the desolate outside world called the Scorch. Janson dispatches WCKD soldiers to pursue and apprehend them. The group takes shelter in an abandoned shopping mall but are shortly attacked by a horde of Cranks and narrowly manage to escape; Winston is scratched during the encounter and becomes infected. By morning, his symptoms worsen, forcing the group to let him shoot himself before he succumbs to the virus. To escape a deadly lightning storm, the group flees into an abandoned facility, where they encounter Brenda and Jorge, leaders of a local survivor camp. Though initially wary, Brenda and Jorge agree to help them locate the Right Arm, abandoning the other survivors when WCKD locates and raids the facility. In the chaos, Thomas and Brenda become separated from the others and are forced to flee on foot. While evading the Cranks, Brenda is bit and infected. The two eventually reunite with the group and Jorge, who beats Marcus, a Right Arm rebel secretly working for WCKD, into revealing the Right Arm's location. The group presses on and eventually reaches a roadblock, where snipers ambush them. However, two rebels, Harriet and Sonya, recognize Aris from their maze and prompt them to stand down. The Gladers, along with Brenda, Jorge, and Aris, are escorted to the Right Arm's mountain outpost, where other Immunes have taken refuge. Vince, the Right Arm's leader, threatens to shoot Brenda after seeing her bite but is stopped by Mary Cooper, a former WCKD scientist. Mary reveals that Thomas, having grown disillusioned with WCKD, acted as their informant and had been aiding the Right Arm in dismantling WCKD's major operations. Mary temporarily halts Brenda's infection using an enzyme and explains that the enzyme must be harvested from an Immune rather than synthetically produced. She reveals that disagreements with Paige over the cure's production led to her departure from WCKD. Teresa, still trusting WCKD's intentions, secretly transmits the camp's location to WCKD forces, who launch an attack. The soldiers quickly overpower the rebels and round up the survivors before Paige and Janson, with the exception of Thomas, Jorge, and Brenda. Teresa reveals having recovered her memories in Janson's facility and now supports WCKD's goals. Janson shoots and kills Mary, and WCKD captures a number of Immunes, including Minho, Aris, and Sonya, before Jorge causes a distraction that allows Thomas to activate a bomb to scatter WCKD's forces and allow the Right Arm to drive them off. With only a handful of survivors remaining, Thomas resolves to take the fight to WCKD, kill Paige, and rescue the captured Immunes.",

    "title": "Equilibrium",
    "plot": "Established by survivors of World War III, the totalitarian city-state of Libria blames human emotion as the root of all conflicts. It strictly outlaws all activities or objects that stimulate emotion, with violators labeled Sense Offenders and sentenced to death. The population has to take a daily injection of the emotion-suppressing drug called Prozium II. Libria is governed by the Tetragrammaton Council, led by \"Father\", who communicates propaganda through giant video screens. The police force is led by the Grammaton Clerics, elite fighters trained in the art of gun kata. Clerics frequently raid homes to search for and destroy illegal materials – art, literature and music – executing violators on the spot. A resistance movement, known as the \"Underground\", emerges to topple Father and the Tetragrammaton Council. In 2072, John Preston is a high-ranking Cleric whose wife, Viviana, was executed as a Sense Offender, leaving him as a single parent of two. Following a raid, Preston's partner Errol Partridge saves a book of poems by W. B. Yeats instead of turning it in for incineration. He follows Partridge to the Nether – a term for regions outside the city – and finds him reading the book. Seeing Preston, Partridge claims he gladly pays the price of feeling emotion. Preston executes Partridge. Preston accidentally breaks his last vial of Prozium and is unable to refill them before the next raid. Brief episodes of emotion set in evoking memories, stirring feelings, and making him more aware of his surroundings. He intentionally skips additional doses of Prozium, hiding them behind his bathroom mirror. Partridge is replaced with an ambitious, career-conscious Brandt, who admires Preston's work as a Cleric. On a raid, they arrest Sense Offender Mary O'Brien. Preston prevents Brandt from executing O'Brien, saying she should be interrogated. Preston feels remorse for killing Partridge, develops an emotional relationship with O'Brien, and seeks atonement. He uncovers clues that lead to meeting Jurgen, the Underground leader. Jurgen plans to disrupt Prozium production to spark an uprising and convinces Preston that Father must be assassinated. Vice-Counsel DuPont meets with Preston to reveal that there is a traitor in the upper ranks of the Clerics, and assigns Preston the task of unmasking the traitor. Relieved, Preston accepts and promises to locate the Underground's leadership. When O'Brien is set to be executed, Preston attempts to stop the execution and fails. His memory of his wife's execution triggers an emotional breakdown. Brandt, who has been suspecting Preston of being a Sense Offender, arrests and brings him before DuPont. Preston tricks DuPont into believing that Brandt is the traitor. Preston is told that his home will be searched as a formality. He rushes home to destroy the hidden vials only to discover his son, who stopped taking Prozium after his mother died, already has. Jurgen tells Preston to capture the resistance leaders to regain Father's trust, hoping it will get him close enough to assassinate Father. Preston is granted an exclusive audience with Father only to discover that Brandt was not arrested; it was part of a ruse to capture Preston and the Underground. DuPont reveals he is Father, having secretly replaced the original Father who died, and that his cabal doesn't take Prozium to suppress emotion. He taunts Preston, asking how it felt to betray the Underground. Having anticipated the trap, Preston fights his way through an army of bodyguards to DuPont's office, confronting and killing Brandt in a katana battle. DuPont and Preston engage in a gun kata showdown. Preston wins as DuPont pleads for his life asking, \"Is it really worth the price?\" Paying homage to Partridge's last words, he responds, \"I pay it gladly\" and kills DuPont to satiate his need for revenge. He destroys the command center that broadcasts Father propaganda. Preston watches with satisfaction from above as the Underground destroys Prozium manufacturing plants, signaling the beginning of the revolution.",

    "plot": "Six months after the Jurassic World incident and the Indominus rex's death, a small mercenary team arrives on the abandoned Isla Nublar to collect DNA from its remains in the lagoon. After a two-man team collects a bone sample, the Mosasaurus devours their submersible. The Tyrannosaurus attacks the team, but the surviving members escape with the sample by helicopter. The Mosasaurus kills one of the men and swims through the partially open underwater gates into the open ocean. Three years later, a U.S. Senate committee debates whether Isla Nublar's dinosaurs should be saved from an impending volcanic eruption. Chaotician Dr. Ian Malcolm testifies that the dinosaurs should perish naturally to correct the wrongful cloning done by John Hammond. Meanwhile, Jurassic World's former operations manager, Claire Dearing, has established the Dinosaur Protection Group to save the animals. After the Senate votes against government involvement in rescuing the animals, Hammond's former partner, Sir Benjamin Lockwood, invites Claire to his Northern California estate. Lockwood and his aide, Eli Mills, reveal a plan to relocate the dinosaurs to a new island sanctuary. Claire is needed to reactivate the park's tracking system to locate the animals, particularly Blue, the last surviving Velociraptor. She recruits Owen Grady, former Velociraptor trainer, to help capture Blue. On Isla Nublar, Claire and former park technician Franklin Webb reactivate the online tracking system. Owen, paleo-veterinarian Zia Rodriguez, and a mercenary team led by Ken Wheatley, track and find Blue. The encounter escalates, resulting in Blue being shot and Wheatley tranquilizing Owen. Wheatley abandons Owen, Claire, and Franklin on the island while forcibly taking Zia hostage to treat Blue. A volcano eruption begins, causing a massive dinosaur stampede and forcing the trio to escape. The ship, loaded with captured dinosaurs, departs as the remaining dinosaurs are left behind to die in the eruption. The trio sneaks aboard the ship and helps Zia transfuse Blue with Tyrannosaurus blood to save her life. The captured dinosaurs are actually being transported to the Lockwood estate, where Lockwood's young, orphaned granddaughter, Maisie, overhears Mills and auctioneer Mr. Eversoll secretly planning to sell the dinosaurs on the black market. They will also preview the Indoraptor, a weaponized, transgenic dinosaur created by geneticist Dr. Henry Wu using Indominus rex and Velociraptor DNA. Wu needs Blue's DNA to create an improved Indoraptor that follows commands, unaware that her blood is no longer pure. After Maisie informs Lockwood about the auction, he confronts Mills, who smothers him to death with a pillow. Maisie is later revealed to have been cloned from Lockwood's deceased daughter and the reason why Hammond ended their association. The auctioned dinosaurs are being immediately shipped out. Franklin evades capture and frees Zia, but Owen and Claire have been apprehended. Owen incites a Stygimoloch into breaking open their cell. The two encounter Maisie and learn the Indoraptor is being sold despite Wu's protests that it is a prototype. Owen disrupts the auction by luring the Stygimoloch into the room. In the ensuing chaos, Wheatley tranquilizes the Indoraptor to extract a tooth as a trophy, but the hybrid, feigning unconsciousness, kills him, along with Eversoll and others, as it escapes. The Indoraptor chases Owen, Claire, and Maisie throughout the mansion until Blue, released by Zia, attacks it. After a standoff atop a high glass roof, both animals crash through it, killing the Indoraptor by impaling him on a ceratopsid skull though Blue is unharmed. When a hydrogen cyanide gas leak threatens the caged dinosaurs, Claire attempts to free them, by opening the cage doors. Owen convinces her not to open the subsequent outer door, but Maisie opens it to save them. As Mills attempts to escape with the Indominus rex bone, the Tyrannosaurus devours him and tramples the bone. Owen, Claire, Maisie, Zia, and Franklin escape, while Blue and the other released dinosaurs flee the estate grounds. In a new U.S. Senate hearing, Dr. Malcolm declares the beginning of a new age, where humans and dinosaurs must coexist. The closing scenes depict the freed dinosaurs roaming the wilderness and outer urban areas.",

    "title": "In Time",
    "plot": "In 2169, people are genetically engineered to stop aging on their 25th birthday, when a one-year countdown on their forearm begins. When it reaches zero, the person \"times out\" and dies instantly. Time has thus become the universal currency, transferred directly between people or stored in \"time capsules\". Several major areas called Time Zones exist; Dayton is the poorest, a manufacturing \"ghetto\" where people rarely have over 24 hours on their clocks, whereas in New Greenwich, the richest Zone, people have enough time to be essentially immortal. Will Salas, a 28-year-old Dayton factory worker, lives with his 50-year-old mother Rachel. One night, he rescues a drunken 105-year-old man named Henry Hamilton from 75-year-old Fortis and his Minutemen, a group of time-robbing thugs. In a secret location, Hamilton, who has 116 years on his clock, reveals to Will that the people of New Greenwich hoard most of the time, while constantly increasing prices to impoverish people in less prosperous districts. The next morning, he transfers all but 5 minutes of his time to a sleeping Will, then times out before Will can stop him, falling off a bridge. Raymond Leon, the 75-year-old leader of a unit of police-like Timekeepers, erroneously assumes Will robbed and killed Hamilton. Heeding his friend Borel's warning against possessing excess time in Dayton, Will donates 10 years (the length of their friendship) to him before departing, planning to relocate to New Greenwich with Rachel. However, that night, Rachel suddenly finds herself with insufficient bus fare to return to Dayton, having exhausted her earnings from two days' work in the Garment District to liquidate a two-day loan. The uncaring driver forces her to run, but she arrives a few seconds too late for Will to rescue her and times out at the last moment in his arms, devastating him. The next morning, he furiously decides to avenge her passing by visiting New Greenwich, internalizing Hamilton's words regarding the inequity of the time system. Arriving in New Greenwich, Will meets 110-year-old time-loaning businessman Philippe Weis and his 27-year-old daughter Sylvia at a casino. While playing poker, Will nearly times out but eventually wins over a millennium in a flawless gamble. Sylvia invites him to a party, and Will commutes there by purchasing a new sports car. Raymond arrives and apprehends Will, who insists his innocence in Hamilton's death. Rather than attempting to prove Will's guilt, he simply confiscates all but two hours of Will's time, explaining it does not belong in Dayton. Fortis's gang ambushes Will and Sylvia, who have escaped back to Dayton with him taking her hostage, leaving them with 30 minutes each. Will visits Borel's residence to retrieve some spare time, but his wife Greta answers, tearfully explaining that he has drunk himself to death. After the two obtain a day each by pawning Sylvia's diamond earrings, Will calls Philippe to request a 1,000-year ransom to be paid into the time-mission for the desperate, releasing Sylvia when he declines. Raymond encounters Will, but when Sylvia accidentally shoots him in the shoulder, Will transfers two hours to Raymond, allowing him to survive long enough for his squad to retrieve him, and purloins his car. Now committed to crashing the system, Will and Sylvia rob Philippe's time banks, donating the extra capsules to the destitute, but soon realize that prices are simply increased to compensate for the extra time. Fortis's gang ambushes them, but Will successfully times out Fortis in an arm wrestling match by using his deceased father's technique and kills his Minutemen. He and Sylvia then decide to rob Philippe's vault of a 1,000,000-year capsule. Raymond pursues them to Dayton, where he was born and raised but eventually escaped from, but fails to stop them from distributing the stolen time. Having neglected to collect his per diem, he times out. Will and Sylvia nearly time out themselves, but survive by taking Raymond's salary. Television reports show factories in Dayton shutting down as everyone abandons their jobs due to possessing sufficient time to sustain themselves. Having witnessed the consequences of Raymond's obsession with the pair, his colleague Jaeger orders the Timekeepers to return home. Will and Sylvia progress to larger banks, still attempting to level the system.",

    "title": "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines",
    "plot": "Ten years after destroying Cyberdyne Systems, John Connor has been living as a nomad following the death of his mother, Sarah Connor, and fears that the malevolent artificial intelligence Skynet is still hunting him despite a war between humans and machines not happening in 1997, as foretold. Unable to locate John in the past, Skynet sends the T-X, an advanced Terminator with shapeshifting liquid metal covering a virtually impervious metal endoskeleton, back in time to John's present in Los Angeles, to kill his future allies in the Resistance, including John's future wife, Kate Brewster. In response, the Resistance sends back a reprogrammed T-850 Terminator to protect John and Kate. After killing other targets, the T-X locates the pair at an animal hospital where Kate works. John becomes the T-X's primary target, but the Terminator helps him and Kate escape, taking them to a mausoleum where John's mother, Sarah, is supposedly interred. Inside her coffin, they find a weapons cache left at Sarah's request in case Judgment Day was not averted and the Terminators returned. They escape an armed battle with the police and fend off the pursuing T-X. The Terminator reveals that John and Sarah's actions only delayed Judgment Day and that Skynet's attack will occur that day; the Terminator intends to drive John and Kate to Mexico to escape the fallout when Skynet begins its nuclear attack. John orders the Terminator to take him and Kate to see her father, U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Robert Brewster. The Terminator refuses because he can't jeopardize his mission; however, when Kate demands to see her father, the Terminator obeys. The pair learns that the Terminator originally killed John in 2032 due to his emotional attachment to the model, before Kate captured and reprogrammed the Terminator and sent it back in time. Meanwhile, General Brewster is supervising the development of Skynet for Cyber Research Systems (CRS), which also develops autonomous weapons. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff pressures him to activate Skynet to stop an anomalous computer virus from invading servers worldwide. General Brewster fails to discover that the virus was Skynet becoming sentient, and John and Kate arrive too late to stop him from activating it. The T-X fatally injures General Brewster and controls the CRS weaponized T-1 and HK drones, which kill the employees. Before he dies, the general gives Kate and John the location of what John believes is Skynet's system core. The pair head for the tarmac to take General Brewster's single-engine plane to Crystal Peak, a facility built inside the Sierra Nevada. After a battle, the T-X severely damages the Terminator, reprogramming it to kill John, and pursues John and Kate through the CRS facility. When a particle accelerator is activated, it magnetically binds the T-X to the equipment. The still-conscious Terminator struggles to control its outer functions. As it prepares to kill John, he urges the Terminator to choose between its conflicting programming; it deliberately forces a shutdown of its corrupted system, enabling the pair's escape. Shortly after they leave, the Terminator's system reboots. Meanwhile, the T-X escapes the accelerator and resumes pursuit. After John and Kate reach Crystal Peak, the T-X arrives by helicopter. Before it can attack, the Terminator arrives in a second helicopter, crashing into and crushing the T-X. The T-X pulls itself from the wreckage and attempts to drag itself inside the bunker to follow the pair. The Terminator holds the bunker door open long enough for the pair to lock them inside, then uses its last hydrogen fuel cell to destroy both itself and the T-X. John and Kate discover that Crystal Peak is not Skynet's core but rather a nuclear fallout shelter command facility for government and military officials. Having no core, Skynet has become a part of cyberspace after becoming self-aware. Judgment Day begins as Skynet fires nuclear missiles worldwide, starting a nuclear holocaust. The pair begins to receive radio transmissions on the emergency radio equipment; John tentatively assumes command by answering radio calls to start fighting back against Skynet.",

    "plot": "In San Francisco, pharmaceutical chemist Will Rodman tests the viral-based drug ALZ-112 on chimpanzees at the biotechnology company Gen-Sys to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease. ALZ-112 is given to a chimpanzee named Bright Eyes, greatly increasing her intelligence. However, during Will's presentation for the drug, Bright Eyes is forced from her cage, goes on a rampage, and is shot to death. Will's superior Steven Jacobs terminates the project and has the chimpanzees euthanized. However, Will's assistant Robert Franklin reveals that the reason for Bright Eyes' rampage was that she had recently given birth. Will reluctantly takes in the infant chimpanzee, eventually naming him Caesar. Discovering that Caesar has inherited his mother's intelligence through being exposed to ALZ-112, Will decides to raise him. Three years pass, Caesar becomes highly intelligent; he can communicate through sign language. Will begins a romantic relationship with primatologist, Caroline Aranha. Will and Caroline introduce Caesar to the redwood forest at Muir Woods National Monument so he can roam. Meanwhile, Will treats his father, Charles, with ALZ-112, which seems to restore his cognitive ability. Five years later, Caesar, now entering adulthood, questions his origins and place in the world. Charles' condition returns as his immune system becomes resistant to ALZ-112. Caesar injures an aggressive neighbor, Douglas Hunsiker, while defending a confused Charles. The local animal control subsequently takes him to an ape shelter. Caesar is tormented by the alpha chimpanzee, Rocket, and the chief guard, Dodge Landon. However, Caesar befriends Maurice, a former circus orangutan who also knows sign language. Caesar learns to unlock his cage, gaining free access to the common area. With the assistance of Buck, a gorilla, Caesar claims the position of alpha. Meanwhile, Jacobs clears the development of a more powerful gaseous version of the drug, the ALZ-113, when Will tells him it can improve intelligence. Will takes the drug home for his father, but Charles declines further treatment and dies overnight. After attempting to test the drug on a bonobo named Koba, Franklin accidentally becomes exposed to ALZ-113 and becomes ill. Despite the risks, Jacobs orders continued trials and Will consequently quits his position. Attempting to warn Will at his home, Franklin sneezes blood onto Hunsiker and is later discovered dead. Will attempts to reclaim Caesar, but Caesar decides to stay. He escapes and steals the ALZ-113 canisters from Will's house and enhances the intelligence of the other apes in the shelter. When Dodge attempts to get him back into his cage, Caesar reveals he can speak; he fights with Dodge while freeing the apes, inadvertently killing him. The apes flee, releasing Koba and the remaining apes from Gen-Sys, and freeing additional apes from the San Francisco Zoo. A battle ensues as the apes fight their way past a police blockade on the Golden Gate Bridge in an attempt to escape into the redwood forest. To rescue Caesar, Buck sacrifices himself to down a helicopter. Koba pushes the helicopter, with Jacobs still inside, into the sea. As the apes find their way into the forest, Will finds and warns Caesar that the humans will hunt them, begging him to return home. Caesar hugs him and says he is home. Will accepts Caesar's wishes and the apes embrace their new lifestyle in the forest. Meanwhile, Hunsiker, now infected with ALZ-113, arrives at San Francisco International Airport for his flight. He eventually spreads the virus around the planet, leading to a deadly pandemic.",

The MIB designates Earth as a neutral zone for alien refugees who live in secret among humans. Agents monitor alien activity and use memory-erasing neuralyzer devices to maintain secrecy. In 1997, MIB Agents K and D disrupt a border patrol operation at the Mexico–United States border to capture an alien named Mikey. When Mikey becomes violent, K kills him and neuralyzes the patrol officers. D, feeling too old to continue, asks K to neuralyze him so he can retire. Soon after, NYPD officer James Darrell Edwards III apprehends a suspect, unaware they are an alien. The alien warns of a coming threat before committing suicide. K, impressed by James’s performance, recruits him into the MIB. After completing a series of tests, James becomes Agent J, and his previous identity is erased from public records. Meanwhile, a hostile alien known as a \"Bug\" crash-lands in upstate New York. The Bug kills a farmer named Edgar and uses his skin as a disguise. K and J, tipped off by a tabloid news article, question Edgar’s wife. They learn that the Bug has killed two aliens who were living on Earth in disguise. Their bodies, along with their pet cat, are sent to a morgue overseen by coroner Laurel Weaver. At the morgue, the alien tells J and Laurel that \"the galaxy is on Orion's Belt\" before dying. After neuralyzing Laurel, K identifies the alien as Rosenberg, a prince from the Arquillian Empire. K and J visit Frank the Pug, an alien informant, who explains that Rosenberg was protecting a miniature galaxy. The galaxy is a powerful energy source which the Bug wants to use to destroy the Arquillians. An Arquillian warship soon arrives in Earth’s orbit and demands the MIB return the galaxy or they will destroy the Earth. J and the Bug both realize the galaxy is on the collar of Rosenberg’s cat, Orion, which is now with Laurel. The Bug captures her and swallows the galaxy. As the Arquillians prepare to destroy Earth to stop the Bug, the MIB locks down all transportation. J guesses the Bug will head to the New York State Pavilion, where the MIB hid flying saucers during the 1964 World’s Fair. At the site, the Bug tries to escape with Laurel. She briefly breaks free, and the agents shoot down the ship. The Bug sheds its human skin and reveals its true form, swallowing the agents’ weapons. K allows himself to be eaten so he can retrieve his weapon from inside. J distracts the Bug until K shoots the Bug apart from within. Laurel uses J’s gun to finish the bug off. After returning the galaxy to the Arquillians, K reveals that he was training J to take his place. J neuralyzes him so he can retire.

    "plot": "In 1995, super soldier Alexei Shostakov and Black Widow assassin Melina Vostokoff work as Russian undercover agents, posing as a family in Ohio with Natasha Romanoff and Yelena Belova as their daughters. They steal S.H.I.E.L.D. intel and escape to Cuba where their boss, General Dreykov, has Romanoff and Yelena taken to the Red Room for training as Widows. In the following decades, Shostakov is imprisoned in Russia while Romanoff and Yelena become successful, dangerous assassins. Romanoff eventually defects to S.H.I.E.L.D. after helping Clint Barton bomb Dreykov's Budapest office, which apparently kills Dreykov and his young daughter Antonia. In 2016, Romanoff is a fugitive for violating the Sokovia Accords. She escapes from U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross and flees to a safehouse in Norway supplied by Rick Mason. Meanwhile, Yelena kills a rogue former Widow but comes in contact with a synthetic gas that neutralizes the Red Room's chemical mind-control agent. Yelena sends antidote vials to Romanoff, hoping she and the Avengers can free the other Widows, and goes into hiding. When Romanoff is unknowingly driving with the vials in her car, Red Room agent Taskmaster attacks her. Romanoff escapes from Taskmaster and realizes that the vials came from Budapest. There she finds Yelena, who reveals that Dreykov is alive and the Red Room is still active. Widows and Taskmaster attack them, but Romanoff and Yelena evade them and meet with Mason, who supplies them with a helicopter. Romanoff and Yelena break Shostakov out of prison to learn Dreykov's location, and he directs them to Vostokoff, who lives on a farm outside Saint Petersburg. There she is refining the chemical mind control process used on the Widows. Vostokoff alerts Dreykov and his agents arrive to take them, but Romanoff convinces Vostokoff to help them and the pair use face mask technology to switch places. At the Red Room, a secret aerial facility, Vostokoff frees Shostakov and Yelena from their restraints. Dreykov sees through Romanoff's disguise. He reveals that Taskmaster is Antonia, who suffered damage in the Budapest bombing that was so severe Dreykov had to put technology in her head to save her. This turned Antonia into the perfect soldier, capable of mimicking the actions of anyone she sees. Romanoff is unable to attack Dreykov due to a pheromone lock installed in every Widow, but negates that by breaking her own nose and severing her olfactory nerve. Shostakov battles Taskmaster while Vostokoff takes out one of the facility's engines, and they then lock Taskmaster in a cell. Dreykov escapes as other Widows attack Romanoff, but Yelena exposes them to the antidote. Romanoff copies the locations of other Widows worldwide from Dreykov's computer as the facility begins to explode and fall. She retrieves two surviving antidote vials and frees Taskmaster from the locked cell. Vostokoff and Shostakov escape via a plane while Yelena blows up Dreykov's aircraft, killing him. In freefall, Romanoff gives Yelena a parachute before battling Taskmaster. After landing, Romanoff uses one antidote vial on Taskmaster and gives the other to Yelena along with the locations of the other mind-controlled Widows so she can find and free them. Yelena, Vostokoff, and Shostakov say goodbye to Romanoff and leave with Antonia and the freed Widows. Two weeks later, Mason supplies Romanoff with a Quinjet to use in freeing the imprisoned Avengers. In a post-credits scene set after Romanoff's death, Yelena visits Romanoff's grave with her dog, Fanny, when she is visited by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine. De Fontaine blames Romanoff's death on Barton and assigns him as Yelena's next target.",

    "title": "The Matrix Reloaded",
    "plot": "Six months after escaping the Matrix, Neo and Trinity are now romantically involved. Morpheus receives a message from Captain Niobe of the Logos calling an emergency meeting of all ships of Zion. An army of Sentinels is tunneling towards Zion and will reach it within 72 hours. Commander Lock orders all ships to return to Zion to prepare, but Morpheus asks one ship to remain to contact the Oracle. But within the Matrix, Bane, a member of the crew, encounters the former Agent Smith. Smith forcibly overwrites his mind, effectively killing him and possessing his body. Thus able to enter the real world, he exits the Matrix. In Zion, Morpheus announces the news of the advancing machines. The Nebuchadnezzar leaves Zion and enters the Matrix, where Neo meets the Oracle's bodyguard Seraph, who leads him to her. The Oracle reveals that she is part of the Matrix and instructs Neo to reach its Source with the help of the Keymaker. As the Oracle departs, Smith appears, telling Neo that he became a rogue program after being defeated by him. He demonstrates his ability to clone himself over other inhabitants of the Matrix, including the new upgraded Agents. He tries to take over Neo's body but fails, prompting a battle between Neo and many copies of Smith. Neo defends himself, but is forced to retreat. Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity visit the Merovingian, who is imprisoning the Keymaker. The Merovingian, a rogue program with his own agenda, refuses to let him go. His wife Persephone, seeking revenge on her husband for his infidelity, leads the trio to the Keymaker. Morpheus, Trinity, and the Keymaker flee while Neo holds off the Merovingian's henchmen. Morpheus and Trinity try to escape with the Keymaker, pursued by several Agents and the Merovingian's chief henchmen, the Twins. After a long chase, Trinity escapes, Morpheus defeats the Twins, and Neo saves Morpheus and the Keymaker from Agent Johnson. The crews of the Nebuchadnezzar, Vigilant, and Logos help the Keymaker and Neo reach the Source. The Logos crew must destroy a power plant and the Vigilant crew must disable a back-up power station to bypass a security system, allowing Neo to enter the Source. Haunted by a vision of Trinity's death, he asks her to remain on the Nebuchadnezzar. The Logos is successful, but the Vigilant is destroyed by a Sentinel. Trinity replaces the Vigilant crew and completes their mission. Agent Thompson corners her and they fight. As Neo, Morpheus, and the Keymaker try to reach the Source, the Smiths ambush them. The Keymaker is killed after unlocking the door to the Source for Neo. Neo meets a program called the Architect, the creator of the Matrix, who explains that, as the One, Neo is an intentional part of the design of the Matrix, which is now in its sixth iteration. Neo is meant to stop the Matrix's fatal system crash that naturally recurs due to humans' free will, leading to dozens of humans gradually refusing to accept the simulation. As with the five previous Ones, Neo has a choice: either reboot the Matrix from the Source and pick a handful of survivors to repopulate the soon-to-be-destroyed Zion, as his predecessors all did, or go to save the imperiled Trinity, causing the Matrix to crash and killing everyone in it. Neo chooses the latter, prompting a dismissive response from the Architect. Neo's vision of Trinity comes true as she is shot by Agent Thompson while falling off a building. Before she hits the ground, Neo arrives and catches her. He then removes the bullet from her chest and restarts her heart. They return to the real world, where Sentinels attack them. The Nebuchadnezzar is destroyed, but the crew escapes. As the Sentinels catch up to them, Neo realizes he can sense the machines in the real world, and telepathically destroys them but falls into a coma. The crew are picked up by another ship, the Mjolnir. The Mjolnir's captain reveals that the machines wiped other ships defending Zion after someone prematurely activated an EMP. Only one survivor was found: the Smith-possessed Bane, who lies beside Neo in the medical bay, also unconscious.",

    "title": "Divergent",
    "plot": "In a futuristic dystopian Chicago, society is divided into five factions: Abnegation (the selfless), Amity (the kind), Candor (the honest), Dauntless (the brave), and Erudite (the intelligent). The remaining population, the Factionless, holds no status or privilege. Upon turning sixteen, children undergo a serum-induced psychological aptitude test that reveals their best-suited faction, although they can choose any faction as their permanent group during the subsequent Choosing Ceremony. Beatrice Prior lives in Abnegation, which runs the government. Her father, Andrew, and Abnegation's leader, Marcus Eaton, serve on the ruling council. When Beatrice was tested, her results show equal attributes of multiple factions: Abnegation, Erudite, and Dauntless, making her a Divergent. Her proctor Tori Wu, a Dauntless woman, records her results as Abnegation. She warns her to conceal her accurate results because Divergents can think independently and would threaten the existing social order. The next day, Beatrice's brother Caleb chooses Erudite at the Choosing Ceremony, while she selects Dauntless. She meets Christina, Al, and Will, other faction transfers. Christina and Al are from Candor, and Will is from Erudite. A harsh Dauntless leader, Eric Colter, warns the initiates that those who fail to meet the faction's high standards will become Factionless. Beatrice jumps from a tall building into a dark hole, landing in a net and gaining respect from Four, a transferred instructor. Beatrice initially struggles in Dauntless training and ranks far below the cutoff after the first evaluation, but with Four's help, she slowly improves. Eric then matches her against her nemesis, Candor transfer Peter Hayes, in a fight that ends with Beatrice's defeat and recovery in the infirmary. Unwilling to miss the crucial Capture the Flag test, she leaves the infirmary, joins the other initiates, secures her team's victory, and makes the final cut. In the next training phase, the initiates confront their deepest fears in psychological simulations. Beatrice's divergence enables her to creatively navigate the tests, but Four cautions her to conceal her abilities and approach the challenges like a typical Dauntless would. Beatrice visits Caleb, who tells her that Erudite plans to overthrow Abnegation. When she returns, Al, Peter, and their fellow Candor transfer Drew attack her, but Four rescues her. Al begs Tris to forgive him the next day, but she refuses and calls him a coward. He later kills himself by jumping into \"The Pit\". Four takes Beatrice into his fear simulations to prepare her for the final test. There, she learns that he is Tobias Eaton and that his father, Marcus, used to beat him as a child. Beatrice then passes her test and officially joins Dauntless. The Dauntless recruits are injected with a serum from Erudite, supposedly for tracking but actually for mind control. The next day, the Dauntless prepares to attack Abnegation under Erudite's orders. As the serum fails on Divergents, Tris must blend in to avoid suspicion. She finds Four, who also pretends to be under control but actually did not take the serum. When the Dauntless raids Abnegation, they split from their group to find Beatrice's parents. However, Eric captures Four, realizing he isn’t under control, and orders Beatrice's execution. Her mother, Natalie, a former Dauntless, saves her but is later shot and killed during their escape. Tris finds her father hiding with Caleb, Marcus, and several Abnegation members. The group sneaks into Dauntless headquarters, where Tris encounters Peter and forces him to lead them to Erudite's control center. Her father sacrifices himself in a shootout, so Beatrice goes in alone to find Four, who is now under mind control. Knowing Four's fears, Beatrice manages to wake him from the mind control, and both enter the central control room, where Erudite's leader, Jeanine Matthews, has Dauntless execute nearly the entire Abnegation faction. Beatrice uses a sample of the mind control serum on Jeanine to force her to cancel the program. The group escapes the compound and boards a train out of the complex.",

    "title": "Godzilla: King of the Monsters",
    "plot": "Five years after the revelation of monsters, called \"Titans\", Dr. Emma Russell, a paleobiologist working for the Titan-studying organisation Monarch, and her daughter Madison witness the birth of a giant larva named Mothra. Emma calms Mothra with the \"Orca\", a device that emits frequencies to attract or alter Titan behaviour. A group of eco-terrorists, led by former British Army Colonel Alan Jonah, attacks the base and abducts Emma and Madison. At the same time, Mothra flees and pupates under a nearby waterfall. Monarch scientists Dr. Ishirō Serizawa and Vivienne Graham approach former employee Dr. Mark Russell, Emma's ex-husband and Madison's father, to help track them down. Mark is initially reluctant due to his hatred toward Godzilla, whom he blames for his son Andrew's death in San Francisco, but eventually agrees. The Monarch team follows Godzilla to Antarctica, where Jonah plans to free a three-headed Titan codenamed \"Monster Zero\". Emma frees and awakens Monster Zero, who shows hostility and slaughters Monarch's Team, battles Godzilla, and flies off. The Monarch team realises that Emma is working with the terrorists. From a bunker, Emma contacts Monarch, arguing that the Titans must be awakened to heal Earth from the human impact on the environment, pointing to Monarch research indicating that Titans can terraform and replenish ecosystems using their radiation. Conflicted, Madison begs her mother to reconsider, but Emma awakens Rodan in Mexico, who is lured toward Monster Zero. After Monster Zero defeats Rodan, just before he can catch the Monarch team in their plane, Godzilla ambushes him, severing his left head. During the fight, the U.S. military launches a prototype weapon called the \"Oxygen Destroyer\", which seemingly kills Godzilla, but leaves Monster Zero unaffected, who regrows his lost head and awakens the other dormant Titans worldwide; Rodan, who survived, submits to his rule. Serizawa chides Mark that he has gotten his wish. Horrified and disillusioned, Madison disowns Emma. Through analysing Monster Zero's abilities and mythological texts, Monarch deduces that it is King Ghidorah, a highly destructive alien who likely seeks to terraform Earth in its image. A fully transformed Mothra flies to Monarch's Bermuda base to communicate with Godzilla, who is recuperating in an ancient, radioactive underwater city, which the Monarch team discovers in their submarine. Deducing it will take too long for Godzilla to heal on his own, Serizawa sacrifices himself by manually detonating a nuclear warhead next to Godzilla to speed up the process. It destroys Godzilla's lair and revives him. Emma realises that Ghidorah's reign over the other Titans is bringing destruction far worse than anything humans could inflict, but Jonah ignores her pleas to try and stop it. Madison overhears her mother's plan to lure Ghidorah to Boston using the Orca, and steals the device to implement it herself. Arriving at Fenway Park, Madison broadcasts a frequency that calms the Titans, but unwittingly attracts them all to her location. Ghidorah, attracted by the frequency, lands in Boston to destroy the Orca device. Just before Ghidorah can kill Madison, Godzilla, with Monarch personnel's assistance, arrives to battle him. Mark leads a team to rescue Madison and escape the city, learning that Godzilla's radiation levels are increasing and will lead to a thermonuclear explosion. Mothra arrives to help Godzilla but is intercepted by Rodan; she defeats him but is injured in the process. Ghidorah overpowers Godzilla, but Mothra sacrifices herself and transfers her energy to Godzilla. The Russells are reunited and reactivate the Orca to lure Ghidorah and prevent him from draining Mothra's energy out of Godzilla. Emma stays behind to distract Ghidorah, giving her family and the Monarch team time to escape. Godzilla enters a newly empowered state and vaporises Ghidorah and Emma, before incinerating Ghidorah's remaining head with his atomic breath afterwards. Rodan and the other Titans converge on Godzilla and bow to him. During the end credits, news clippings and Monarch public files show that the Titans are healing Earth, a suspected second Mothra egg has been discovered, and some Titans are converging on Skull Island. Ancient cave paintings depict Godzilla and Kong-like Titans locked in battle. In a post-credits scene, Jonah and his forces purchase Ghidorah's decapitated left head in Mexico.",

Working as a limousine driver in El Paso, Texas, he and the mutant tracker Caliban take care of the elderly Charles Xavier, in an abandoned smelting plant in northern Mexico. Xavier suffers from dementia that causes him to have destructive telepathic seizures, one of which killed several of the X-Men years prior. Logan reluctantly agrees to escort Gabriela López, a former nurse for biotechnology corporation Alkali-Transigen, and a young girl named Laura to Eden, a supposed refuge near the American-Canadian border. After finding Gabriela dead, Logan is confronted by Donald Pierce, Transigen's cyborg chief of security, who was the one who killed her, and was looking for Laura, who has stowed away in Logan's limo and has powers similar to his. She, Logan, and Xavier escape from Pierce and his Reavers, but Caliban is captured. Pierce tortures Caliban into tracking Laura. Xavier and Logan watch a video on Gabriela's phone, revealing that Transigen created Laura and other children from mutant DNA to become weapons. The children proved challenging to control and were to be executed, but Gabriela and other nurses helped some escape. Xavier reveals to Logan that Laura was created from Logan's DNA and calls her Logan's daughter. In Oklahoma City, Logan discovers that Eden appears in Laura's X-Men comic and tells her it is fictional. The Reavers arrive, but Xavier has a seizure that incapacitates everyone except Logan and Laura, who kill the attackers and inject Xavier with his medication. As they flee, Dr. Zander Rice, the head of Transigen, arrives to help Pierce. Logan, Laura, and Xavier help farmer Will Munson and his family after a traffic incident, accepting an offer of dinner at their home, where Logan drives off enforcers from a corporate farm. Rice unleashes X-24, a mindless clone of Logan in his prime created as Transigen's ultimate weapon. X-24 murders Will's family and Xavier before capturing Laura. Caliban sets off grenades, killing himself and several Reavers but only injuring Pierce. Logan is outmatched by X-24, but Will pins X-24 with his truck before dying from his injuries. Logan and Laura escape with Xavier's body. After burying Xavier, Logan passes out. Laura takes him to a doctor and persuades him to prove that the site in North Dakota is not Eden. They find Rictor and other Transigen children preparing to cross into Canada. Laura finds an adamantium bullet that Logan has kept since he escaped from the Weapon X facility, which he once considered using to commit suicide. Logan decides not to accompany them, to Laura's dismay. When the Reavers ambush the children, Logan takes an overdose of a serum given to him by Rictor that temporarily enhances his healing abilities and boosts his strength. With Laura's help, he slaughters most of the Reavers before the serum wears off. As Pierce holds Rictor at gunpoint, Rice tells Logan, who killed Rice's father years ago at the Weapon X facility, that no new mutants have been born due to genetically engineered crops created by Transigen and distributed through the world's food supply. Logan, having found a gun, shoots Rice dead and injures Pierce. X-24 fights Logan as the children combine their powers to kill Pierce and the remaining Reavers. Rictor uses his powers to flip a truck onto X-24, but X-24 frees himself and impales Logan on a large tree branch, mortally wounding him. Laura loads Logan's revolver with the adamantium bullet and shoots X-24 in the head, killing him. Near death, Logan tells Laura not to become the weapon she was made to be, and after she tearfully acknowledges him as her father, Logan dies peacefully in Laura's arms. She and the children bury Logan, with Laura reciting as his eulogy the closing speech from Shane, which Logan, Xavier, and she had watched in the Oklahoma City hotel. Before the children depart, Laura tilts the Cross on his grave marker to create an X.",

    "title": "John Carter",
    "plot": "In 1881, Edgar Rice Burroughs arrives at the estate of his recently deceased uncle, John Carter, a former American Civil War Confederate Army captain who died suddenly. Per Carter's instructions, the body is put in a tomb that can be unlocked only from the inside. His attorney gives Carter's personal journal to Burroughs to whom Carter bequeathed his fortune. In a flashback to 1868 in the Arizona Territory, Union Colonel Powell arrests Carter with hopes that Carter will help in fighting local Apache. Carter escapes his holding cell, but fails to get far with U.S. cavalry soldiers in close pursuit. After a run-in with a band of Apaches, Carter and a wounded Powell are chased until they hide in a cave that turns out to be filled with gold. A Thern appears in the cave at that moment and, surprised by the two men, attacks them with a knife; Carter kills him but accidentally activates the Thern's powerful medallion and is unwittingly transported to a ruined and dying planet, Barsoom, known to Carter as Mars. Because of his different bone density and the planet's low gravity, Carter is able to jump high and perform feats of incredible strength. He is captured by the Tharks, a nomadic tribe of Green Martians and their Jeddak, Tars Tarkas. Elsewhere on Barsoom, the Red Martian cities of Helium and Zodanga have been at war for a thousand years. Sab Than, Jeddak of Zodanga, armed with a special weapon obtained from the Thern leader Matai Shang, proposes a cease-fire and an end to the war by marrying the Princess of Helium, Dejah Thoris. The Princess escapes and is rescued by Carter. Carter, Dejah, and Tarkas's daughter, Sola, reach a spot in a sacred river to find a way for Carter to get back to Earth. They discover that the medallions are powered by a \"ninth ray\" that is also the source of Sab Than's weapon. They are then attacked by a vicious race called the Warhoon under the direction of Shang. Carter and Dejah are taken back to Zodanga. A demoralized Dejah grudgingly agrees to marry Sab Than and gives Carter instructions on how to use the medallion to return to Earth. Carter decides to stay but is captured by Shang, who explains to him the purpose of Therns and how they manipulate the civilizations of different worlds to their doom, feeding off the planet's resources in the process, and intend to do the same thing with Barsoom by choosing Sab Than to rule the planet. Carter escapes and returns to the Tharks with Sola to request their help. There they discover a ruthless brute, Tal Hajus, has overthrown Tarkas. Carter and an injured Tarkas battle with two enormous Great White-Apes in an arena before Carter kills Hajus, thereby becoming the leader of the Tharks. The Thark army storms Zodanga, but it is empty; realizing their army is waiting outside Helium, Carter and the Tharks commandeer the Zodangan airships and fly to Helium. Carter defeats the Zodangan army, while Sab Than is killed and Shang is forced to escape. Carter becomes prince of Helium by marrying Dejah. On their first night, Carter decides to stay on Mars and throws away his medallion. Seizing this opportunity, Shang briefly reappears and gives Carter another challenge by sending him back to Earth. Carter embarks on a long quest to find one of the Therns' medallions on Earth; after several years he appears to die suddenly and asks for unusual funeral arrangements — consistent with his having found a medallion, since his return to Mars would leave his Earth body in a coma-like state, and makes Burroughs his protector. Back in the present, Burroughs runs back to Carter's tomb and uses clues to open it. Just as he does so, a Thern appears and raises a weapon before Carter appears and shoots the Thern dead. He reveals that he had never found another medallion; instead, he devised a scheme to lure a Thern from hiding, thus winning Shang's challenge. Carter then uses the dead Thern's medallion to return to Barsoom.",

    "plot": "Carol Danvers destroys the Supreme Intelligence, the artificial intelligence that leads the Kree empire. This leads to a civil war on planet Hala, the Kree home world, rendering the planet barren as it loses its air, water, and sunlight over the next 30 years. The Kree come to know Danvers as \"the Annihilator\". The Kree's new leader Dar-Benn discovers one of the two legendary Quantum Bands, which were previously used to create a network that allows fast travel across space. She uses the Band to forcibly open a new jump point that connects to the network. The resulting anomaly impacts the entire network, including a jump point near Earth's S.A.B.E.R. space station run by Nick Fury. Captain Monica Rambeau investigates the jump point near S.A.B.E.R. while Danvers investigates the new one that Dar-Benn opened. When they touch their respective jump points, Rambeau is transported to Danvers's location, Kamala Khan—who has the other Quantum Band on Earth—is transported to Rambeau's location, and Danvers is transported to Kamala's house. The three use their different light-based powers to fight off Kree enemies, leaving Kamala's home destroyed. After the trio return to their original places, Fury and Rambeau visit Kamala on Earth. Rambeau surmises that their light-based powers are linked through quantum entanglement and that they switch places when any of the three use their powers simultaneously. They join up at a Skrull refugee colony on planet Tarnax, which Danvers helped found and where a peace treaty is being negotiated with the Kree. When talks break down, Dar-Benn rips open another jump point which siphons the atmosphere from Tarnax to restore breathable air to Hala. After a hasty effort to evacuate the colony, Danvers, Rambeau, and Kamala form a team that Kamala names \"the Marvels\". Danvers explains that Dar-Benn's repeated rupturing of jump points is causing instability in the network and endangering the entire universe. They deduce that Dar-Benn is targeting planets that are meaningful to Danvers, whom Dar-Benn blames for the desolation of Hala. The Marvels travel to the water planet Aladna—where people communicate in song—and warn Prince Yan, Danvers's husband through a diplomatic act. Dar-Benn arrives and tears open a jump point, drawing the planet's water to Hala. Her final plan is to use the energy from Earth's sun to restore that of Hala's sun. On S.A.B.E.R., Goose—Danvers's cat-like pet Flerken—gives birth to a litter of kittens that can temporarily consume people, which Fury uses to evacuate the station's personnel. Dar-Benn steals Kamala's Band and attempts to use both Bands, but this destroys Dar-Benn, ends the Marvels' entanglement, and leaves behind a rupture between realities. Kamala reclaims the Bands and joins Danvers to energize Rambeau, allowing her to close the rupture but stranding her on the other side. Kamala returns to Earth and Danvers uses her power to restore Hala's sun. Kamala's family helps Danvers move into Rambeau's house. Kamala's short-lived team-up with Danvers and Rambeau inspires her to seek out other young heroes and form a new group, starting with Kate Bishop. In a mid-credits scene, Rambeau awakes in a parallel universe where she is greeted by Binary—an alternate version of her mother Maria—and the mutant scientist Hank McCoy.",

    "title": "Armageddon",
    "plot": "A massive meteor shower destroys the orbiting Space Shuttle Atlantis before entering the atmosphere and bombarding Boston, Philadelphia, Moncton, Halifax, Newfoundland and New York City, the latter being extensively damaged. The meteors were pushed out of the asteroid belt by a collision from a rogue comet the size of Texas and NASA learns it will impact Earth in 18 days, wiping out all life on Earth. NASA devises a plan to drill a deep hole into the asteroid, into which they will insert and detonate a nuclear bomb to destroy it. They recruit Harry Stamper, a third-generation oil driller and owner of an oil drilling company, who agrees to help but on the condition that he bring in his own team to do the drilling. He picks his best employees for the job: Chick Chapple, his best friend and right-hand man; geologists Rockhound and Oscar Choice; and drillers Bear Curlene, Freddie Noonan, Max Lennert, and A. J. Frost (who has been dating Harry's daughter Grace despite Harry's objections). Over twelve days, they are trained to become astronauts with astronaut Willie Sharp, who will pilot Freedom—one of the two super shuttles to fly to the asteroid, the other being the Independence. Before leaving, Chick apologizes to his ex-wife for wronging her and sees his son—who is unaware of his parentage—and Grace accepts A.J.'s marriage proposal, much to Harry's reluctant dismay; she later has her father promise to return home safe and with her fiancé. Following the destruction of Shanghai by another meteor strike, word of the asteroid becomes public to the world. Both shuttles take off without incident and dock with the Russian space station Mir to take on fuel, but faulty materials start a fire in the fuel pod. A.J. and Roscosmos cosmonaut Lev Andropov narrowly manage to board Independence before the space station is destroyed. Approaching the asteroid, Independence is damaged by debris and crashes, killing all on board except Lev, Bear, and A.J. They embark in the shuttle's mobile driller “Armadillo” to find the Freedom crew, which landed 26 miles from its intended landing/drilling site. When the drilling goes slower than predicted, Sharp reports to Mission Control that it is unlikely they will reach the depth necessary to destroy the asteroid before \"Zero Barrier\", the point after which detonating the rock will not save Earth. The president of the United States decides to remotely detonate the bomb from Earth immediately, not understanding this will cause total mission failure. Sharp and Harry have a vicious argument, but agree to defuse the bomb and work together after Harry promises Sharp that he will accomplish the mission. They make up on lost drilling time, but a missed gas pocket causes their Armadillo and Max to be blown into space. Just as Harry, NASA, and the world believe the mission to be a failure, while another meteor destroys Paris, A.J. and the others arrive in the second Armadillo. A.J. successfully finishes the drilling, but a rock storm kills Gruber and damages the bomb’s remote detonator, forcing someone to stay behind and manually detonate it. They draw straws; A.J. is given the responsibility. Harry takes him down to the asteroid's surface, only to disconnect A.J.'s air hose and force him into the shuttle's air lock, before telling A.J. that he is the son Harry never had, and he would be proud to have him marry Grace. Using the Armadillo, Harry tearfully gives Grace his blessing to marry A.J., and Grace says she is proud to be his daughter. After various difficulties, Freedom takes off, and just before Zero Barrier, Harry manages to detonate the bomb and saves the planet, sacrificing his life in the process. The astronauts land on Earth safely. A.J. and Grace are reunited, and Chick reconciles with his ex-wife and estranged son. During the credits, A.J. and Grace are married, with the portraits of Harry and the others lost on the mission present in memoriam.",

    "plot": "In 2014, an attempt to stop climate change via stratospheric aerosol injection catastrophically backfires, creating a new ice age that destroys much of life on Earth. For 17 years, the remnants of humanity shelter in a state-of-the-art self-sustaining circumnavigational train, the Snowpiercer, run by reclusive transportation magnate Wilford. The passengers on the train are segregated, with the elite in the extravagant front cars and the poor crammed into squalid tail compartments overseen by armed guards. Urged by his mentor Gilliam, Curtis Everett and his second-in-command, Edgar, lead the tail passengers in a revolt. They free Namgoong Minsoo, a captive security specialist. For his assistance, they bribe him with Kronole, an addictive drug made from industrial waste. Namgoong also insists that his clairvoyant daughter, Yona, be freed. Namgoong helps the tail mob progress, but they face guards armed with melee weapons, overseen by Minister Mason. Edgar is held hostage, but Curtis allows him to be killed to capture Mason, forcing her to order the remaining guards to surrender. The tail mob stays back, holding the guards captive, while Curtis takes Mason, Namgoong, Yona, skilled fighter Grey, and Tanya and Andrew (two parents who had their children taken from them) towards the front of the train. Curtis's group travels through several opulent cars. Namgoong and Yona recognize a landmark outside and speculate that the ice may be thawing more and more with every passing year. The group reaches a schoolroom, where a teacher is indoctrinating the children on Wilford's greatness. A bald man brings eggs for the children to celebrate the train's eighteenth circumnavigation of the Earth. Then the bald man goes to the tail army and shoots them with automatic firearms hidden under the eggs. The captured guards are freed, as is Mason's henchman Franco. The teacher, who received a gun from the bald man, kills Andrew before Grey kills her. Franco broadcasts to the classroom his execution of Gilliam, which prompts Curtis to execute Mason in turn. Curtis's group moves on, but Franco catches up with them, killing Grey and Tanya. Franco is then seemingly killed by Curtis and Namgoong. In the last compartment before the engine, Namgoong reveals that the reason he collected the Kronole was to use it as an explosive to escape the train with Yona, believing they can now survive outside. Curtis explains that in the early days of the train, the tail section resorted to cannibalism. Edgar was an infant when Curtis killed his mother, and Curtis was going to eat him when Gilliam offered his severed arm instead, stopping the bloodshed. Curtis wants to confront Wilford for causing such horrors. Wilford's assistant, Claude, emerges from behind the engine room door to invite Curtis inside. Curtis meets Wilford and, to his shock, learns that he and Gilliam conspired to stage Curtis's rebellion to reduce the tail section's population to sustainable levels. After ordering the execution of most of the tail section residents, Wilford offers Curtis his position leading the train. Curtis appears ready to accept as Yona overpowers Claude, rushes in, and asks for a match. In desperation, she pulls open a floorboard to reveal Tanya's son, Timmy, who has been enslaved to work as a replacement for a broken machine part. Appalled, Curtis beats up Wilford and rescues Timmy from the machinery, losing his arm in the process. Andy, Andrew's missing son, crawls out of a nook and climbs into the engine core despite Curtis's pleas. Curtis gives Yona the match to light the fuse for the Kronole bomb, while Namgoong fights and kills Franco, who followed them. Damaged by the fighting, the door to the engine room cannot be closed, forcing Curtis and Namgoong to use their bodies to protect Yona and Timmy from the blast. The explosion triggers an avalanche that derails and wrecks the train. Curtis and Namgoong are unresponsive, so Yona and Timmy escape the wreckage. They see a polar bear in the distance, indicating that life exists outside the train and did not die out as they were always led to believe.",

    "plot": "In 2005, potentially habitable \"Planet G\" is discovered, and in 2006, a communications array to reach any extraterrestrial life is built in Oahu. There, a slacking Alex Hopper is arrested while attempting to impress Samantha \"Sam\" Shane, daughter of Admiral Terrance Shane. Alex’s brother, Commander Stone Hopper, furiously forces Alex to join the U.S. Navy. Six years later, Alex is a lieutenant aboard the USS John Paul Jones and in a relationship with Sam, a physical therapist working with wounded veterans. While Stone is a model officer commanding the USS Sampson, the rebellious Alex, despite showing plenty of potential, is facing a disciplinary discharge. During the 2012 RIMPAC exercise, five alien spacecraft arrive. Their communications ship hits a satellite and crashes through the Bank of China Tower in Hong Kong, while the others plunge into the waters off the coast of Hawaii. Sampson, John Paul Jones, and Japanese destroyer JDS Myōkō discover a floating structure that generates an impenetrable force field isolating the Hawaiian Islands and the three destroyers from the rest of the world, and jamming all radar and communications inside. Three alien warships surface, and first contact devolves into a battle after the humans decide to fire a warning shot across the aliens' bow; Myōkō is destroyed, Sampson is lost with all hands including Stone, and John Paul Jones’ command personnel are killed, leaving Alex to reluctantly take charge as the next highest-ranking sailor on board after the executive officer is also lost. John Paul Jones disengages to recover Myōkō’s survivors, including Captain Yugi Nagata, while alien drones destroy Oahu’s military bases. Hiking near the communications array, Sam and retired US Army lieutenant colonel and double amputee Mick Canales discover the aliens' presence. They encounter scientist Cal Zapata, who reveals the aliens have taken over the array to re-establish communications with their home planet. The John Paul Jones’ crew captures an alien, which telepathically shows Alex images of alien conflict and planetary destruction. More aliens board and retrieve their comrade while one starts sabotaging the ship. Its armored suit proves impervious to small-arms fire but it is obliterated by the destroyer’s 5-inch gun, and the captured alien's helmet reveals their eyes are sensitive to sunlight. Ashore, Sam, Mick, and Cal recover his spectrum analyzer, using it to radio John Paul Jones that the aliens will contact their planet and most likely call for reinforcements when the facility’s satellite is in position in four hours. As night falls, Hopper realises they have no visibility. Nagata suggests using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tsunami warning buoys around Hawaii to track the warships without radar; this plan works and allows John Paul Jones to destroy two of them. The third proves too elusive, so they lure it into facing east as the sun rises. Alex and Nagata shoot out its bridge windows with sniper rifles, blinding its crew with sunlight and allowing John Paul Jones to destroy it. The destroyer then attempts to target the communications array, but is sunk by drones launched from the alien structure emitting the force field; Alex, Nagata, and several other sailors barely escape. The survivors commandeer the decommissioned World War II battleship USS Missouri with the aid of retired Navy veterans. The floating structure is revealed to be a giant mothership, but Missouri disables the force field, allowing Admiral Shane to scramble fighter jets from the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan. The battleship’s turret carrying the ship’s last shell is disabled, forcing the sailors to carry the shell to the ship's last functioning turret. Sam, Mick, and Cal stall the aliens at the array, where Mick kills an alien soldier. Alex uses the final shell to destroy the array, rendering the Missouri defenseless, but the mothership’s drones are destroyed by Royal Australian Air Force F/A-18 fighter jets, as reinforcements carpet bomb the mothership, eliminating the alien threat. Alex is promoted to lieutenant commander and presented with a Silver Star and his brother's posthumous Navy Cross. Admiral Shane promises Alex will soon have a ship of his own, while he is also recommended to become a Navy SEAL. Alex asks him for Sam’s hand in marriage; the admiral initially refuses, but invites Alex to lunch. In a post-credits scene, some people in Scotland are scared off by an alien that emerges from something that fell from the sky.",

He and his partner, Nicks, act on an anonymous tip that a safe deposit box will be robbed, and witness a mysterious man give instructions to bystanders who immediately follow his commands. Rourke opens the box to find a picture of Minnie with the message \"Find Lev Dellrayne\", and the mysterious man escapes. The tip is traced to fortune-teller Diana Cruz, who reveals that she and the mysterious man, Lev Dellrayne, are \"Hypnotics\", powerful hypnotists who escaped from the secretive government \"Division\" that trained them. Rourke is mysteriously immune to her mind-control abilities, and Dellrayne hypnotizes Nicks into attacking them, forcing Cruz to kill Nicks. Pursued by Dellrayne and law enforcement under his influence, Rourke and Cruz flee to Mexico. They visit Jeremiah, a former Division member who explains that Dellrayne stole a Division weapon known as \"Domino\". Having wiped his own memory to keep Domino hidden, Dellrayne left himself \"triggers\" to recall its location and regain his hypnotic power. Jeremiah is revealed to be Dellrayne in disguise, and corners Rourke and Cruz by controlling an angry crowd. Rourke discovers his own hypnotic power, turning the crowd against Dellrayne and escaping with Cruz. Rourke and Cruz seek out River, a reclusive hacker who infiltrates the Division database and learns that Rourke's ex-wife, Vivian, is a Division agent. Dellrayne calls Rourke, who struggles to resist his command to kill Cruz, and Rourke and Cruz sleep together. Rourke discovers that \"Domino\" is actually Minnie; she is the daughter of two powerful hypnotics, Rourke and Vivian, who has been posing as \"Cruz\". Rourke realizes that his life as a detective is a charade, a hypnotic \"construct\" created inside a Division facility. His memories have been altered, and Vivian, Nicks, River, and everyone else he has encountered are Division agents led by Dellrayne. Minnie was born and raised within the Division, but Rourke hid her to stop her from becoming their weapon. He wiped his memory to protect her, so the Division has repeatedly forced him to relive the constructed scenario to locate Minnie. Rourke's mind is again \"reset\", bringing him back to the therapy session and reliving the same events, but his powers allow him to awaken from the construct and escape. The Division realizes that \"Find Lev Dellrayne\" refers to an address on \"Deer Valley Lane\", where Rourke hid Minnie with her grandparents, Carl and Thelma. At their ranch, Rourke is reunited with his daughter, but Vivian soon arrives with Dellrayne and his agents. With her memories restored by Minnie, Vivian realizes she aided Rourke and Minnie's escape and wiped her own memory, keeping Minnie hidden until she could grow powerful enough to defeat the entire Division. Minnie provided the \"Find Lev Dellrayne\" photo to lead the Division to her, and Dellrayne realizes they are inside another construct she created. After forcing Dellrayne and his agents to kill each other, Minnie and her family celebrate their newfound freedom. In a mid-credits scene, the family departs as Carl stays behind, and is revealed to be Dellrayne.

On hearing sirens, Alex tries to flee, but Dim smashes a bottle in his face and leaves him to be arrested. The woman dies of her injuries, and Alex is sentenced to 14 years in prison for murder. Two years into the sentence, Alex accepts an offer to be a test subject for the Minister of the Interior's new Ludovico technique, an experimental aversion therapy for rehabilitating criminals within two weeks. Alex is strapped to a chair, his eyes clamped open, and injected with drugs. He is forced to watch films of sex and violence, some accompanied by his favourite composer, Ludwig van Beethoven. Alex is nauseated and, fearing he will be sick upon hearing Beethoven, begs for an end to the treatment. The Minister demonstrates Alex's rehabilitation to officials. Alex is unable to fight back against an actor who taunts and attacks him, and becomes ill upon attempting to grope a topless woman. The prison chaplain complains that Alex has been robbed of his free will; the Minister asserts that the Ludovico technique will cut crime and alleviate crowding in prisons, allowing more space for political prisoners. Released from prison, Alex finds his possessions have been sold to provide compensation for his victims and his parents have let out his room. A vagrant whom Alex attacked years earlier attacks him with his friends. Alex is saved by two policemen whom he is shocked to find are his former droogs Dim and Georgie. They beat and nearly drown him before abandoning him. Alex collapses on the doorstep of a nearby home. Alex wakes to find himself in the home of Mr Alexander, who now uses a wheelchair. Alexander does not recognise Alex from the previous attack but knows of him and the Ludovico technique from the newspapers. He prepares to present Alex to his colleagues as a political weapon. Alex breaks into \"Singin' in the Rain\" while bathing, and Alexander realises it was he who assaulted his wife and him. Alexander drugs Alex and locks him in a bedroom, then plays Beethoven's Ninth Symphony loudly from the floor below. Unable to withstand the pain, Alex attempts suicide by jumping from the window. Alex awakes in hospital with multiple injuries. During psychological tests, he finds he no longer has aversions to violence and sex. The Minister arrives and apologises, saying the government has had Mr Alexander institutionalised. He offers to take care of Alex and get him a job in return for his co-operation with his election campaign and public relations counter-offensive. The Minister brings in a stereo system playing Beethoven's Ninth. Alex contemplates violence and has thoughts of having sex with a woman in front of an approving crowd, thinking, \"I was cured, all right!\"",

    "title": "The Philadelphia Experiment",
    "plot": "In 2012, scientist Richard Falkner and his team recreate the Philadelphia Experiment for the defense contractor that employs them. They use their boss Kathryn Moore's car in a test of the technology, which renders the car invisible. However, the generators do not shut down as planned, and the car never returns. The USS Eldridge, which vanished in the original 1943 experiment, suddenly materializes in a rural Pennsylvania airstrip. Bill Gardner, the only survivor of the Eldridge's crew, awakens and discovers his crewmates fused into the floor and walls of the ship. Frightened, he flees the ship, while deputy Carl Reed inadvertently boards it during his investigation. Bill wanders into the nearby town and discovers from a newspaper that he has been transported to 2012. The Eldridge disappears again, causing him to experience a painful seizure and release an electromagnetic burst from his body. He goes to his home in search of his wife, where he meets his granddaughter Molly. After being convinced of Bill's story, Molly uses her computer hacking skills to investigate the Philadelphia Experiment's history. Hagan, an agent sent by Kathryn, attacks them, but they knock him out and escape. Meanwhile, the Eldridge reappears above Chicago, becoming embedded into the top of a skyscraper. Inside the ship, Carl discovers himself stuck with his arm fused to a wall. Bill and Molly travel to a location given to them by a mysterious caller. When they arrive, they meet Morton Salinger, the scientist who supervised the original Philadelphia Experiment in 1943. Salinger explains that when the government sold the project's assets, Kathryn's company offered him a position, which he rejected out of fear that they would recreate the experiment. Salinger then faked his death and began working on a way to stop the experiment for good. Hagan and his men pursue them, and during the chase, Salinger is fatally wounded by gunfire. Bill and Molly get away, but when Salinger refuses to disclose their destination, Hagan executes him. The Eldridge jumps again, landing in the Sahara Desert. Falkner determines that the generators from his experiment connected to the generators from 1943, thus creating a link between the two time periods. The Eldridge's leaps, if not stopped, will cause a temporal collapse and destroy the planet. Kathryn, unwilling to believe this, sends fighter jets to bomb the ship, but the electromagnetic energy around it destroys them. Following Salinger's instructions, Bill and Molly go to his institute, where his colleagues were developing a way to stop the experiment. However, Hagan's team anticipated their arrival and slaughtered all of the researchers. Bill uses his electromagnetic energy to fight back, and the duo are rescued by Falkner, who has lost faith in Kathryn. They go to the site of the present-day experiment, where Falkner explains that the Eldridge's generators are feeding his and keeping the time vortex open. The only way to save the world is for Bill to board the ship, shut down the generators, and return to 1943 with it. Falkner uses the generators to summon the Eldridge to the lab. Bill enters it and frees Carl by using his energy to remove Carl's arm from the wall. Kathryn arrives with Hagan, having discovered Falkner's treachery, and shoots him. While Hagan enters the Eldridge to kill Bill, Kathryn has her men begin removing disks from the computers, causing the ship to destabilize and prepare to jump again. Bill begins shutting down the generator, but is ambushed by Hagan. The two fight, and Bill overpowers him with Carl's aid before fusing his head to the generator, killing him. Molly kills Kathryn and escapes with Carl, while a time vortex in the sky above the lab pulls the Eldridge into itself with Bill aboard, returning them to 1943 and repairing the timeline. In the aftermath, Molly marries Carl. A now-elderly Bill, having gotten to live his life in full after returning to his proper time, is seen living with her.",

    "plot": "Jonas Taylor is a rescue diver who attempts to save the crew of a damaged nuclear submarine as the hull is being rammed by an unidentified creature. He is forced to flee and leave two of his crewmembers trapped in the sub, as attempting rescue would result in the deaths of everyone they have already saved. His story is dismissed by fellow survivor Dr. Heller, who denounces his actions, believing that he was psychotic. Five years later, billionaire Jack Morris meets Dr. Minway Zhang at the underwater research facility Mana One. Zhang and his oceanographer daughter Suyin supervise a mission to explore a deeper section of the Mariana Trench, previously concealed by a thermocline of hydrogen sulfide. The submersible is piloted by Japanese scientist Toshi, American scientist \"The Wall,\" and Jonas' ex-wife Lori. They are attacked and trapped by a large creature. Zhang and Jonas' old friend and Mana One operations manager, James \"Mac\" Mackreides, venture to Thailand to recruit Jonas, now a loner. Suyin attempts the rescue but is attacked by a giant squid that is subsequently killed by an enormous shark. Jonas goes down to save the crew; Toshi sacrifices himself to the shark to help the others escape. The Mana One crew discovers that the giant shark is a Megalodon or \"Meg\", a prehistoric species of shark previously believed to be extinct. When they realize the meg pursued them past the thermocline, they resolve to kill it, knowing modern humans are unequipped to deal with such an ancient creature. After Jonas marks it with a tracker, Suyin enters a shark-proof tank to shoot the meg with poison, which successfully kills the creature. In their moment of triumph, a second, larger meg (revealed to be the one they encountered in the trench) emerges, devouring The Wall and the dead Meg. It critically wounds Dr. Minway Zhang and Dr. Heller sacrifices himself to save a fellow crewmember as the ship capsizes and sinks. Dr. Minway Zhang dies on the way to rescue. Back at the station, Morris claims that he has informed all neighboring governments about the Meg, and has sent destroyers to torpedo the shark. However, he secretly enlists a mercenary team to kill the Meg with depth charges. The team fails and Morris is eaten by the Meg. The Mana One crew learns that Morris lied and no one is coming to help them. They decide to kill the Meg themselves. The meg attacks a crowded beach in Sanya Bay in China, causing panic to the people, but the Mana One Crew use whale sounds to lure the meg away. Jonas manages to wound the Meg with his submersible and stabs it in the eye, crippling it; its blood attracts a shiver of different species of modern sharks that unite together and devour the dying Meg. Jonas reunites with the crew, and they celebrate their survival.",

    "plot": "Terravex Oil is in the midst of a fracking operation in North Dakota, overseen by CEO Reece Tenneson and geologist Jim Dowd. The operation releases a trio of squid-like creatures from underground and destroys the drilling rig. Two are captured by Terravex, but one of them escapes. Meanwhile, high school senior Tripp Coley has taken up a job at a junkyard, where he builds a pickup truck in hopes of being able to leave his town, but the truck lacks a working drivetrain. One night, Tripp encounters the escaped creature in the junkyard and captures it, but the creature escapes before he can seek authorities. The next day, Tripp discovers that the creature feeds on oil and has taken shelter in the hood of his truck. He befriends him, names him Creech, and promises to help him get home. Tripp modifies the truck to give Creech more control as a makeshift engine. The truck acts as a 'wheelchair' for Creech to operate. Meanwhile, Tenneson is still concerned about the incident at the drilling rig, since similar experiments have revealed the existence of other creatures. He decides to protect the company's image by drilling poison into a hole leading to the underwater tunnels, and by sending hired mercenary Burke to kill their captured creatures, to the objection of Dowd, as he finds the monsters have significant intelligence and emotions as well as a hive mind intelligence that allows both of the captured specimens to learn what was taught to one. Tripp and his classmate Meredith, whom he has told about Creech, seek help from his estranged father Wade, but Wade sells Tripp out to Burke. Tripp and Meredith escape in the truck with Creech and are chased by Burke and his team along with Rick, the local sheriff and Tripp's stepfather. They escape by jumping over a MRL local with an EMD MP15DC lead train, and camping at a hunting cabin. When Creech gets the sense something bad will happen to the other creatures, he heads to Terravex headquarters where they are being held captive. Tripp and Meredith follow Creech. When they arrive, they find Creech's parents, but are attacked by Terravex workers. Creech is captured, and Tripp and Meredith are taken to Tenneson. Dowd decides to help Tripp and Meredith rescue the creatures. They acquire two more trucks and modify the trucks for Creech's parents to control. Dowd helps the group by stealing the Terravex truck on which Creech's parents are loaded. At the dealership, the creatures take control of the modified trucks, and the group make their escape up the mountain leading to the tunnels. Terravex gives chase up the mountain and the group escapes. On the way, Rick helps Tripp and the group escape from Burke, preventing Burke from ramming them off the road and later stealing a large truck to block the road to prevent further pursuit. After realizing the poison has been inserted, Tripp gets into a head-on battle with Burke, who attempts to push him into the drilling hole, but it ends when Tripp and Creech overturn Burke's truck, destroying the poison machine and apparently killing Burke when his truck is thrown into the equipment. Creech saves Tripp from drowning before he and his parents depart back home where the others of their kind are, and Terravex is exposed by the group for the experimentation that was harming the creatures' habitat. Tenneson is arrested for his crimes, Tripp and Rick grow closer and rebuild a V8 engine for the truck, and Tripp and Meredith begin a relationship.",

    "title": "The Matrix Resurrections",
    "plot": "A young woman named Bugs learns that the Matrix is running old code in a loop, enacting the moment when Trinity first found Neo within the Matrix. Bugs discovers a program embodying Morpheus and helps free him from the simulation. Thomas Anderson is the creator of a video game series called The Matrix, based on his faint memories as Neo. At a coffee shop, he regularly encounters Tiffany, a married mother with no recollection of her past, on whom Anderson based the game character Trinity. Anderson has created a simulation called a Modal to develop game characters. He struggles to separate perceived reality from dreams, a known concern among his co-workers and partner. Thomas's psychoanalyst prescribes him blue pills that he takes each day to suppress the occurrences, but he stops taking them. Meanwhile, as Bugs and Morpheus work to extract Neo from the Matrix, Anderson's business partner regains his memories as Agent Smith, Neo's former nemesis. Neo awakens in a pod and notices Trinity confined in another nearby, before being extracted to Bugs's hovercraft Mnemosyne. Neo is brought to the human city Io, the sister city of Zion, where he reunites with an elderly Niobe. She explains that sixty years have passed in the real world since the Machine War ended, and that Neo's allies, including the original Morpheus, have all died over time. The peace achieved by Neo's sacrifice lasted for many years, but the large number of humans leaving the Matrix created a serious power shortage, causing the machines to fight over limited resources. Soon afterward, Zion was targeted in an attempt to get humans to use as the power supply once more. However, this attempt caused many machines, who still remembered Neo's sacrifice and the promise of peace, to turn on the others in order to protect the humans. This allowed most of Zion's citizens to escape. Io was then founded by both machines and humans who have been working together ever since against the remaining machines who want to return things to the way they were before the war. Niobe refuses to risk Io's safety to help Neo free Trinity and confines him to his quarters. Bugs and her crewmates free Neo and enter the Matrix to contact Trinity. They are attacked by Smith and other exiled programs, including the Merovingian, but Neo and the Mnemosyne crew defeat them as Neo's abilities return. The group leaves and locates Trinity, but before Neo can talk to her, his therapist appears and immobilizes him by manipulating time. He reveals that he is The Analyst, a program designed to study the human psyche. The Analyst explains that after Neo's and Trinity's deaths, he wanted to study Neo's body and his anomalous powers as The One and convinced his superiors to resurrect both of them. He discovered that due to The One's inherent connection to all humanity in the Matrix, manipulating Neo could make the Matrix produce more energy. Moreover, he found that the code anomaly in Neo was shared in his bond with Trinity, and that by suppressing their memories and keeping them close but always apart, the Matrix generated much more energy. Solving the energy crisis put The Analyst in a position to seize power from The Architect, after which he rebuilt the Matrix to control humans with emotional manipulation, claiming that humans generally believe what they want to believe. Neo's liberation destabilized the system and triggered a fail-safe to reboot the Matrix, but The Analyst stalled the reboot by convincing his superiors that threatening to kill Trinity would coerce Neo to return to his pod. Neo and Bugs return to Io and talk to Sati, an exiled program that Neo previously met. Seeking to avenge her parents' deaths at the hands of the Analyst, Sati helps devise a plan to free Trinity. Back in the Matrix, Neo makes a deal with The Analyst: he will return to his pod if he fails to convince Trinity to leave the Matrix. Tiffany reaffirms her identity as Trinity while talking with Neo. Realizing that he has lost, The Analyst attempts to kill her, but Agent Smith appears and attacks The Analyst, seeking revenge for his own imprisonment after being restored as a result of Neo's resurrection. Neo, Trinity, and the others escape in their vehicles, chased through the streets by hordes of bot programs and attack helicopters. As the last ones to be extracted from The Matrix, Neo and Trinity become cornered atop a skyscraper. Holding hands, they leap off and Trinity begins to fly, taking them to safety. With Trinity's newfound control over the Matrix, both return to confront The Analyst. They thank him for giving them a second chance by resurrecting them while they also express their contempt. Neo and Trinity fly off into the sky together, making plans to remake The Matrix.",

    "title": "Minority Report",
    "plot": "In 2054, the federal government plans to nationally implement the Washington, D.C., prototype \"Precrime\" police program, which has been operating for six years. Three clairvoyant humans (\"precogs\") receive psychic impressions of an impending homicide, and officers analyze their visions to determine the location and apprehend the perpetrator before the crime can occur. Would-be killers are placed in an electrically induced coma and held in a panopticon-like prison facility. Although Precrime has eliminated nearly all premeditated murders during its six-year existence, spontaneous crimes of passion called \"red ball\" killings still occur, giving the police only a short time to act. Precrime chief John Anderton joined the program after his six-year-old son Sean was abducted and never found. He suffers from depression and addiction to a drug called neuroin, and his wife Lara has left him. Department of Justice agent Danny Witwer audits the Precrime operation, intent on uncovering any flaws. Agatha, one of the precogs, experiences a flashback to a woman's drowning as Anderton watches. Curious, he learns from the prison warden that the intended victim, Anne Lively, went missing shortly after her murder was prevented; however, he also discovers that Agatha's vision of the crime is not on file. Soon afterward, the precogs predict that Anderton will kill a man named Leo Crow, whom he has never met. Anderton flees, prompting Witwer to begin a manhunt. Anderton visits Dr. Iris Hineman, a geneticist whose research led to the creation of Precrime, and learns that the precogs' abilities are the result of brain damage in the womb caused by their parents' addiction to early, impure forms of neuroin during pregnancy. Hineman explains that one precog occasionally sees a different future vision from the others, known as a \"minority report\". These discrepancies are purged from the official record to maintain the precogs' reputation of infallibility, but the precogs retain their memories. If Anderton does have a minority report, Hineman says, it will most likely have been generated by Agatha since she is the strongest of the three. After undergoing eye transplant surgery to evade the retinal scanners installed all over the city, Anderton returns to Precrime. Using his removed old eyes, which he kept after the transplant surgery, he enters the Temple where the precogs are kept and kidnaps Agatha, shutting down the group-mind on which Precrime depends. With the assistance of a cybercriminal, Anderton searches Agatha's memories but fails to find a minority report for Crow's murder. However, he finds and downloads her memories of Anne's death. The two track Crow to a hotel room and find photos of many children, including his son Sean. Anderton accuses Crow of killing Sean and nearly kills him but relents at the last moment to place him under arrest. Crow then claims he was hired to plant the photos and begs Anderton to kill him, saying that his family will only be paid if he dies. When Anderton still refuses, Crow kills himself in a manner similar to the precogs' vision of Anderton killing him. Tipped off by Anderton, Witwer investigates Anne's case and finds discrepancies to suggest that she had indeed been murdered. He reports his findings to Lamar Burgess, director of Precrime, who kills him with Anderton's gun, safe in the knowledge that the offline precogs cannot reveal him to be Witwer's murderer. Anderton takes Agatha to Lara's house, where they are finally tracked down by a tactical team of Precrime officers. Anderton is arrested and imprisoned for the murders of Crow and Witwer, and Agatha is returned to the other precogs. After Anderton's imprisonment, Lara discusses Anderton's concerns about Anne Lively with Burgess. Burgess initially denies any recollection of Anne Lively but later in the same conversation says he will look into her drowning—a detail Lara never mentioned. She becomes suspicious and breaks Anderton out of prison, allowing him to confront Burgess at a banquet celebrating the national launch of Precrime. At the banquet, Anderton puts a call through to Burgess, confronting the director with the crime recurring in Agatha's memory that Burgess is trying to conceal. Anne, a neuroin addict and Agatha's mother, had given up custody of Agatha; some time later, she broke her habit and tried to reclaim her daughter. Desperate to preserve Precrime, Burgess hired a man to kill Anne, knowing that Precrime would intervene, then killed her himself in the predicted manner afterward. The Precrime technicians, trained to disregard the second murder vision as an echo of the first one, deleted the record. Once Anderton began to investigate, Burgess arranged for Crow to pose as Sean's abductor in order to provoke Anderton to murder. A \"red ball\" report comes in, indicating that Burgess will kill Anderton. As the two men face each other down, Anderton points out the dilemma facing Burgess: he can spare Anderton and watch Precrime be discredited and shut down, or validate the program by killing him and going to prison. Burgess asks Anderton's forgiveness before killing himself. Anderton and Lara reconcile, with Lara becoming pregnant with another child. Precrime is abandoned and the prisoners are pardoned and released, though many remain under police surveillance. The precogs are moved to an undisclosed location to live in peace.",

    "plot": "Young boy Frank Walker attends the New York World's Fair to sell his prototype jet pack, but is rejected because it does not work. He is approached by the young girl Athena, who hands him an orange lapel pin with a blue \"T\" embossed on it, telling him to follow her onto Walt Disney's \"It's a Small World\" attraction at the Fair's Pepsi-Cola Pavilion. Frank obeys, sneaking onto the ride. There, the pin is scanned by a laser, and he is transported to Tomorrowland, a futuristic cityscape, where advanced robots fix his jetpack, allowing him to fly and join the secretive world. In the present day, optimistic teenager Casey Newton repeatedly sabotages the planned demolition of a NASA launch site in Florida. Her father Eddie, a NASA engineer, faces losing his job. Casey is eventually caught and arrested. At the police station, she finds a pin in her belongings. Touching it, the pin transports her to Tomorrowland. Her adventure is cut short when the pin's battery runs out, leaving Casey stranded in a lake. With help from her younger brother Nate, Casey finds a Houston memorabilia store related to the pin. The owners attack her when she is unable to divulge where she got the pin, insisting that Casey knows about a \"little girl\". Athena bursts in and defeats the owners, actually Audio-Animatronics, who self-destruct, blowing apart the shop. After Casey and Athena steal a car, Athena reveals she is also an animatronic, purposed to find and recruit people who fit the ideals of Tomorrowland. She then drops Casey off outside an adult Frank's house in Pittsfield, New York. The now reclusive, cynical Frank declines Casey's request to take her to Tomorrowland, having been banished from it years ago. Inside his house, Casey finds a probability counter marking the end of the world. Frank warns her that the future is doomed, but she disagrees, thus lowering the counter's probability. Animatronic assassins arrive to kill Casey, but she and Frank escape, meeting Athena in the woods outside his house. Frank resents Athena for lying to him about her true nature, but reluctantly agrees to help them get to Tomorrowland. Using a teleportation device, the trio travel to the top of the Eiffel Tower. Frank explains that Gustave Eiffel, Jules Verne, Nikola Tesla, and Thomas Edison co-founded Plus Ultra, a secret society of futurists, creating Tomorrowland in another dimension, free to make scientific breakthroughs without obstruction. The trio use an antique rocket, called the Spectacle, hidden beneath the Eiffel Tower to travel to Tomorrowland. There, they find Tomorrowland in a state of decay. David Nix, Tomorrowland's governor, greets them. They travel to a tachyon machine, invented by Frank, which accurately predicted the worldwide catastrophe. Casey refuses to accept the world will end, causing the future to temporarily alter. Frank attempts to convince Nix to listen, who refuses and intends to have the group leave Tomorrowland. Casey realizes the tachyon machine is telling humanity that the world will end, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. They confront Nix, who admits he tried to prevent the future by projecting such images to humanity as a warning. Instead, they embraced the apocalypse, refusing to act to make a better future for their world. Believing that humanity simply gave up, Nix has too and intends to allow the apocalypse to happen so he can rebuild the world to his liking. Casey, Frank, and Athena attempt to use a bomb to destroy the machine, leading to a fight with Nix. The bomb is accidentally thrown through a portal to an uninhabited island on Earth, the explosion pinning Nix's leg. Athena sees a vision of the future where Frank is shot by Nix, and she jumps in the way of his attack, mortally wounding herself beyond repair. Making peace with Frank, Athena activates her self-destruct sequence, destroying the machine, which falls on Nix, killing him. In the present, Casey and Frank lead Tomorrowland, recruit Eddie and Nate, and create a new group of recruitment animatronics like Athena, whom they were addressing at the beginning of the film. Given pins, the animatronic children set out to recruit new dreamers and thinkers for Tomorrowland.",

    "plot": "Special Forces team commander Duke leads the G.I. Joe Team to the Korean Demilitarized Zone to rescue a North Korean defector. They are then assigned another mission to steal nuclear warheads from Pakistan after the death of its President during a civil war. Deeming them as traitors for causing an international incident, Zartan, still impersonating the president of the United States, calls an airstrike that kills Duke and many Joes. Heavy machine gunner Roadblock, sniper Flint, and covert operator Lady Jaye survive the attack by diving into a well, and they return to the United States to contact General Joseph Colton, who provides them with weapons. Meanwhile, Storm Shadow, who survived the Arctic base's destruction, and demolitions expert Firefly rescue Cobra Commander from an underground maximum-security prison in Germany, leaving Destro behind. Storm Shadow is injured and retreats to a temple in the Himalayas to recover. The Blind Master, leader of the Arashikage Clan, sends Snake Eyes and his apprentice Jinx, to capture Storm Shadow, allowing him to answer for the murder of his uncle, the Hard Master. After Zartan announces that Cobra will become the premier U.S. special forces team, replacing G.I. Joe, Lady Jaye deduces that someone is impersonating the President by noting changes in his speech patterns. At a presidential fundraiser, she steals a sample of the President's DNA, confirming that he is Zartan. They escape after a confrontation with Firefly and Zandar, the head of the U.S. Secret Service's Presidential Detail and a member of Cobra. Snake Eyes and Jinx locate and capture Storm Shadow after a battle with some ninjas loyal to Storm Shadow and take him back to Tokyo, where Storm Shadow proclaims that he did not kill the Hard Master and proves it by fighting Snake Eyes with the weapon that killed the Hard Master, which breaks as it is not Arashikage steel. The Blind Master deduces that Zartan was the one that murdered the Hard Master and framed Storm Shadow for it, who joined Cobra to bring it down from the inside. Exonerated, Storm Shadow accompanies Snake Eyes and Jinx, his cousin, as they join the Joes' efforts to stop Cobra and avenge the Hard Master. Zartan invites the world leaders to a summit at Fort Sumter, where he launches the entire US nuclear arsenal, forcing the other nuclear powers to do the same.

    "plot": "Former Episcopal priest Graham Hess lives on a rural farm in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, with his asthmatic preteen son, Morgan, and young daughter, Bo. Graham's younger brother Merrill, a failed minor league baseball player, has been helping the family since Graham's wife Colleen died in a traffic collision six months earlier. Graham abandoned the church in the aftermath of the incident. When large crop circles appear in the Hesses' cornfield, they are initially attributed to vandals. However, other crop circles, and lights from invisible objects hovering over many of Earth's cities, begin appearing globally. One night, Graham and Merrill chase a figure into the field. Over the next several days, Graham glimpses another among the corn stalks, followed by strange clicking noises broadcast through Bo's old baby monitor. To the family's continued terror, news footage emerges out of Brazil showing, undeniably at that point, an alien that can blend into its surroundings. After receiving a phone call from Ray Reddy, the man responsible for his wife's death, Graham travels to Reddy's home, finding him sitting in his car outside. Expressing remorse for Colleen's death, he warns Graham that one of the aliens is locked inside his pantry. Believing the aliens avoid water, he leaves for a lakeside. Graham enters the house and uses a kitchen knife to peer under the pantry door. A clawed hand emerges and swipes at Graham; he cuts off the fingers in a panic. As the aliens' worldwide invasion begins, the family barricades themselves inside their house, taking shelter in the basement when the aliens break in. Morgan has an asthma attack and the family doesn't have his medication, but he survives the night. The family emerges the next morning after the radio reports the aliens have abruptly abandoned Earth as if something scared them off. The alien previously trapped inside Reddy's pantry enters the house and takes Morgan hostage. Recalling Colleen's dying words, Graham tells Merrill to \"swing away\" using his baseball bat. The alien sprays Morgan with toxic gas from its wrist. Graham recovers his stricken son as Merrill engages the creature, discovering during the fight that water is toxic to the aliens. Merrill gradually weakens the alien by smashing several glasses of water, left by Bo throughout the house, at the creature, eventually killing it with a strike to the head that spills water from a glass on the creature's face. Outside, Graham administers Morgan's medication, realizing that his son's constricted lungs prevented him from inhaling the toxins, an act that Graham attributes to the intervention of a higher power. Months later, the Hess family has recovered from the ordeal and Graham returns to the church.",

    "title": "Quarantine 2: Terminal",
    "plot": "On a flight from Los Angeles to Kansas City, passenger Ralph Bundt becomes violent and attempts to enter the cockpit. Ralph had been bitten by a lab rat, brought onto the plane by Henry, who claimed they were his classroom's pet hamsters. Ralph bites flight attendant Paula on the face, to the horror of her colleague Jenny. Captain Forrest and First Officer Willsy land the plane at the nearest city. Disobeying orders, they pull up to a jetway operated by baggage handler Ed Ramirez. Everyone flees the plane, except for elderly couple Bev and Doc Stevens and the pilots, who try to contain Ralph in a bathroom. The passengers find that they have been locked out of the terminal, which is quickly surrounded by armed soldiers and CDC scientists. Passenger Shilah Washington reveals she has a medical kit in her bag in the cargo hold. Jenny, Henry, Ed, and fellow passengers Niall and Preston go to retrieve it. There they find the bathroom empty and covered in blood. Preston gets Doc off the plane, while the others retrieve Shilah's kit and Niall's handgun. Jenny is attacked by an infected Captain Forrest and Niall shoots and kills him, but is splattered by the captain's blood. Leaving the plane, they find Preston's body, and avoid an infected Bev. Rejoining the others, the group deduces that the infection is probably a form of rabies spread through bites. When Doc is bitten by an infected rat, they lock him and Paula away. George, an unaccompanied minor, tells the others that Henry brought the rats onto the plane. As Henry tells Jenny that George is just confused, they are attacked by the escaped Ralph, but kill him with the help of Ed and Shilah. Four heavily armed officers arrive to administer drugs to the group, but also release the infected passengers from their confinement. Passenger Louise Treadwell is bitten by her infected cat, while the infected Doc bites one of the officers. After shooting Doc, the officers and a passenger named Hvorst attempt to evacuate but are shot and killed by personnel outside the doors, leaving Hvorst's girlfriend, Nicca, distraught. Ed drags one surviving officer back inside. The survivors hear the screams of the infected (at this point they are Willsy, Louise, Preston, and Paula). Ed points out an airport catering truck the survivors can hide in. As the others clamber inside the truck, Niall and Susan share a loving embrace, until Niall begins to drool and turns. Henry and the others grab Susan and begin pulling her into the truck. Niall, fully turned, grabs her from the back and pulls her off the truck floor. The group in the truck question the wounded officer, who reveals that he does not represent the CDC but rather CBDT, meaning Chemical Biological Domestic Terrorism, a division of the Department of Homeland Security that specializes in countering chemical and biological terrorism. He tells them about a quarantined building in Los Angeles that housed a lab for a group of bioterrorists and confirms that the drugs are only experimental antidotes. The wounded officer then shoots himself. Just as Ed suggests escaping through an old drainage tunnel beneath the terminal, Willsy appears on the roof of the truck; George then raises the truck and crushes Willsy. The survivors access the tunnel, though Nicca is attacked and dragged away. Jenny kills an attacking Paula. While searching for directions to the tunnel, the group is attacked by Niall and Susan. Henry kills them, but he is bitten. George confronts him with suspicious evidence concerning viruses that he found in Henry's briefcase, to which Henry admits being part of the terrorist cell at the apartment building, who have planned a worldwide plague to cull the human population. After a struggle, Henry shoots and kills Ed, administers his trial antidote to himself and then kidnaps George to use him as a human shield. Shilah and Jenny separate to find George and Henry. While searching for George and Henry, Jenny is chased and attacked by an infected Preston. Running along the baggage conveyor belts Jenny eventually taunts him into crawling into part of the conveyor belts machinery and kills him. Continuing to look, Jenny quietly sneaks past an infected Nicca. Shilah finds Jenny and gives her thermal goggles. She then reveals to Jenny that she has been bitten, and sacrifices herself to the infected so Jenny can escape. While escaping into the wall, Jenny is attacked by an infected Louise but she knocks her unconscious with the wrench. Jenny uses the goggles and finds George near the tunnel, where he tells her the antidote has failed and that Henry is infected. Henry then appears and attacks her. After a struggle with Jenny, George shoots him and Jenny bashes in his skull. As Jenny and George crawl through the dark drainage tunnel, George sees through the thermal goggles that she has been bitten. George escapes through the grate at the end of the drainage tunnel but Jenny cannot fit through the bars, and he reluctantly leaves her behind as she succumbs to the infection. George discards the thermal vision goggles, through which Louise's infected cat is seen walking towards the Luxor Las Vegas hotel, implying that the plane landed at McCarran International Airport and that all efforts to contain the virus have failed.",

    "plot": "Sightless aliens with sharp hearing and impenetrable armored skin have taken over the planet and killed most of the human population. The Abbott family – father Lee, mother Evelyn, deaf daughter Regan, and sons Marcus and Beau – live on their isolated farm in the middle of a forest in upstate New York, and have survived by taking precautions such as laying sand paths to avoid stepping on crunching leaves and using American Sign Language when communicating. When the family goes into the nearby town for supplies, Beau finds a toy Space Shuttle, but Lee makes him leave it behind due to the noise it would make if powered on. As they are getting ready to leave, Regan returns it without its batteries, but Beau replaces them without anyone noticing. While walking back home, Beau activates it, which starts making noise. Almost immediately, Beau is killed by a nearby alien before Lee can reach him. Regan suffers terrible guilt thereafter, which she hides from her parents, although Marcus is aware of it. Over a year after Beau's death, Evelyn is pregnant with a fourth child. Marcus reluctantly goes fishing with Lee while Regan, upset that she cannot go, visits Beau's grave. While the rest of the family is gone, Evelyn goes into labor. While heading to the basement, she accidentally steps on an upright nail and drops a photo frame, alerting a nearby alien which enters the house. Struggling to stay silent amidst the pain, Evelyn flips a switch in the basement, turning the surrounding lights around the house red. The alien enters the basement soon after, but Evelyn distracts it with the loud clicks of an egg timer and escapes upstairs. Upon returning to the farm and seeing the red lights, Marcus and Lee lure the alien out of the house by lighting off fireworks, allowing Evelyn to safely give birth to her baby. Regan, seeing the fireworks, runs back to the house. Lee enters the house armed with a shotgun and finds the baby and Evelyn, then brings them into a hiding spot under the floor in the barn outside. The baby cries, and a creature enters the barn. The alien fails to find the source of the noise, but breaks some water pipes. Evelyn wakes up in the flooded hideout with the alien still inside and hides behind the falling water to mask her and the baby's sound. Marcus and Regan climb to the top of a corn silo and light a signal fire to alert their father, but Marcus falls into the silo and almost becomes sucked into the corn. Hearing this, the alien, which is hunting for Evelyn, runs towards the silo and attacks Regan and Marcus. The alien's disruptive effect on electronics causes Regan's cochlear implant to emit a high-pitched noise, which causes the creature to reel in pain and retreat, breaking a hole in the silo which frees the children. Lee finds Regan and Marcus, directing them to his truck and is wounded when an alien attacks him. Marcus cannot stifle a scream, and the alien attacks the truck. Lee signs to Regan that he has always loved her and proceeds to yell to draw the alien’s attention, sacrificing himself in order to allow Marcus and Regan to drive the truck back to the house safely. Reuniting with a grieving Evelyn they make their way back into the house, followed by an alien. Regan, remembering the reaction it had to the high-pitched noise from her implant, places it on a microphone which amplifies the noise. The alien screeches in pain and exposes the vulnerable tissue beneath the armor plating on its head, allowing Evelyn to kill it with Lee's shotgun. Armed with a new weapon, the family prepares to defend themselves from the approaching pack of aliens who heard the shot.",

    "plot": "On Halloween, Gotham City mayor Don Mitchell Jr. is murdered by a masked serial killer, the Riddler. Reclusive billionaire Bruce Wayne, who has operated for two years as the vigilante Batman, investigates the murder alongside Lieutenant Jim Gordon, much to the disdain of the Gotham City Police Department (GCPD). The Riddler has left a message for Batman at the crime scene. The following night, the Riddler kills the police commissioner, Pete Savage, and leaves another message for Batman. Batman and Gordon discover that the Riddler left a thumb drive in Mitchell's car containing images of Mitchell's affair with a woman, Annika Kosolov, at the Iceberg Lounge—a nightclub operated by the Penguin, crime boss Carmine Falcone's lieutenant. While the Penguin pleads ignorance, Batman notices that Annika's roommate Selina Kyle works at the club as a waitress. When Annika disappears, Batman sends Selina to the Iceberg Lounge for answers and discovers that Savage, Mitchell, and the district attorney Gil Colson are on Falcone's payroll. The Riddler abducts Colson, straps a timed collar bomb to his neck, and sends him to interrupt Mitchell's funeral. When Batman arrives, the Riddler calls him via Colson's phone and threatens to detonate the bomb if Colson cannot answer three riddles. Colson refuses to answer the third—the name of the informant who gave the GCPD information that led to a historic drug bust ending mob boss Salvatore Maroni's operation—and is killed. Batman and Gordon deduce that the informant may be the Penguin and track him to a drug deal. They discover that Maroni's operation was transferred to Falcone, with many corrupt officers involved. Selina inadvertently exposes them when she arrives to steal money and discovers Annika's corpse in the trunk of a car. Batman captures the Penguin after a car chase, but he and Gordon learn that the Penguin is not the informant. Batman and Gordon follow the Riddler's trail to the ruins of an orphanage initially funded by Bruce's deceased parents, Thomas and Martha Wayne, where they learn that the Riddler holds a grudge against the Wayne family for failing the orphanage. Bruce's butler and caretaker Alfred Pennyworth is hospitalized after opening a letter bomb addressed to Bruce. The Riddler leaks evidence that Thomas, who was running for mayor before he was murdered, hired Falcone to kill Maroni's journalist, who was writing a story about Martha's family history of mental illness. Bruce confronts Alfred, who maintains that Thomas only asked Falcone to threaten the journalist into silence. Upon learning that Falcone had murdered the journalist instead, Thomas planned to turn both himself and Falcone over to the police. Alfred believes that Falcone had Thomas and Martha killed to silence them. Selina reveals to Batman that Falcone is her father. After learning that Falcone killed Annika for discovering that he was the informant, Selina tries to kill him, but Batman and Gordon arrive in time to stop her. Gordon arrests Falcone, but the Riddler kills Falcone with a sniper rifle moments later. The Riddler is caught, unmasked as forensic accountant Edward Nashton, and incarcerated in Arkham State Hospital, where he tells Batman he took inspiration from him when targeting the corrupt. Batman learns that Nashton has planted car bombs and cultivated an online following that plans to assassinate Mayor-elect Bella Reál. The bombs destroy the seawall around Gotham and flood the city. Nashton's followers attempt to kill Reál at her victory celebration in an arena, but Batman and Selina stop them. Batman saves the crowds in the flooding arena from electrocution and leads them to safety. In the aftermath, Nashton befriends another inmate, while Selina deems Gotham beyond saving and leaves. Batman continues to aid the city's recovery efforts and vows to inspire hope in Gotham rather than exacting vengeance.",

    "plot": "In an unnamed city overcome with violent crime and corruption, disillusioned police Detective Lieutenant William Somerset is one week from retirement. He is partnered with David Mills, a young, short-tempered, idealistic detective who recently relocated to the city with his wife, Tracy. On Monday, Somerset and Mills investigate an obese man who was forced to eat until his stomach burst, killing him. The detectives find the word \"gluttony\" written on a wall. Somerset, considering the case too extreme for his last investigation, asks to be reassigned, but his request is denied. The following day, another victim, who had been forced to cut one pound (0.45 kg) of flesh from his body, is found; the crime scene is marked \"greed.\" Clues at the scene lead Somerset and Mills to the sloth victim, a drug-dealing pederast whom they find emaciated and restrained to a bed. Photographs reveal the victim was restrained for precisely one year. Somerset surmises the murders are based on the Christian concept of the seven deadly sins. Tracy invites Somerset to share supper with her and Mills, helping the detectives overcome their mutual hostility. On Friday, Tracy meets privately with Somerset because she has no other acquaintances in the city. She reveals her unhappiness at moving there, especially after learning she is pregnant, and believes the city is an unfit place to raise a child. Somerset sympathizes with Tracy, having persuaded his former girlfriend to abort their child for similar reasons and regretting it ever since. He advises Tracy to inform Mills only if she intends to keep the child. A remark by Mills inspires Somerset to research libraries for anyone checking out books based on the seven deadly sins, leading the pair to the apartment of a man known only as John Doe. Unexpectedly, Doe returns home and is pursued by Mills. Doe incapacitates him by striking him with a tire iron and holds him at gunpoint, but chooses to leave him alive and flees. The police investigate the apartment, finding a large amount of money, hundreds of notebooks, and photographs of some of his victims; the cache includes images of Somerset and Mills by a person they believed was an intrusive journalist at the sloth crime scene. Doe calls the apartment and speaks of his admiration for Mills. On Saturday, Somerset and Mills investigate the fourth victim, lust, a prostitute who had been raped with a custom-made, bladed strap-on by a man held at gunpoint. The following day, the pride victim is found: a model whom Doe facially disfigured. Unable to live without her beauty, she committed suicide. As Somerset and Mills return to the police station, Doe arrives covered in blood and surrenders himself. He threatens to plead insanity at his trial, potentially escaping punishment, unless Mills and Somerset escort him to an undisclosed location where they will find the envy and wrath victims. During the drive, Doe says he believes God has chosen him to send a message about the ubiquity of, and apathy toward, sin. Doe has no remorse for his victims, believing the murders will force society to pay attention to him. Doe leads the detectives to a remote location far outside city limits, where a delivery van approaches. Somerset intercepts the vehicle, whose driver was instructed to deliver a package to Mills at this specific time and location. He is horrified at the package's contents and tells Mills to put down his gun. Doe reveals he himself represents envy because he envied Mills's life with Tracy and implies the package contains her severed head. He urges Mills to become wrath, telling him Tracy begged for her life and that of her unborn child, and takes pleasure in realizing Mills was unaware of her pregnancy. Despite Somerset's pleas, Mills, distraught and enraged, shoots Doe dead, completing Doe's plan. Police remove the catatonic Mills, and Somerset tells his captain he will \"be around.\" Somerset says in voiceover: \"Ernest Hemingway once wrote: 'The world is a fine place, and worth fighting for.' I agree with the second part.\"",

He helps his colleague Ralphie train to become a security guard. Unable to sleep, Robert often spends late nights reading at an all-night diner, where he befriends Teri, a teenage sex worker trafficked by the Russian mafia. One evening, Teri shares that her real name is Alina and that she dreams of becoming a singer. Robert and Alina take a stroll, but Alina's pimp Slavi abruptly arrives, hits her and forces her into a car. Slavi hands Robert a business card for their escort service before driving away. A few nights later, a badly injured Alina is admitted to the ICU at a nearby hospital. Upon hearing the news, Robert learns from her friend Mandy that Slavi is responsible for her condition. Finding Slavi and his men at their restaurant, he is bluntly refused when he offers to buy Alina's freedom, so he swiftly kills them all. Unbeknownst to Robert, Slavi and his men are part of a much larger crime syndicate led by Russian oligarch Vladimir Pushkin. Teddy Rensen, Pushkin's enforcer, arrives in Boston to investigate the attack. Aided by Boston police detectives on Pushkin's payroll, Teddy canvasses rival gangs in the area, beating Irish mob lieutenant \"Little John\" Looney almost to death to send a message. Robert continues exacting vigilante justice on the criminals he encounters. He blackmails two corrupt cops into returning racketeering money to Ralphie's mother and beats a gunman with a hammer after he robbed the hardware store, taking a coworker's heirloom ring from her. Teddy kills Mandy after learning that she has concealed information about Robert. He visits Robert at his apartment, where both try to intimidate each other. Teddy and his goons later try to kidnap Robert, who eludes them. Robert's former DIA colleague, Susan Plummer, identifies Teddy as Nicolai Itchenko, formerly of USSR secret police, with Spetsnaz background. He has murdered two of the Boston police detectives who failed to kidnap Robert; a third, named Frank Masters had not been heard from for days. Susan also briefs Robert on Pushkin's operation. Robert tracks Masters down and threatens him into helping take down one of Pushkin's money laundering warehouses. Masters and Pushkin's men are taken into custody when the police arrive and find a note left by Robert to \"follow the money.\" He confronts Nicolai again, threatening to commit more damage if he continues to pursue him. Robert destroys two of Pushkin's oil tankers. Nicolai abducts Robert's coworkers at the hardware store to force him for a meeting. To Nicolai's surprise, Robert skips the meeting and kills the men to ensure the safety of the hostages they were guarding. Nicolai arrives with his men, but Robert stealthily kills them with improvised weapons collected throughout the hardware store and later kills Nicolai with a rivet gun to save a cornered Ralphie. Three days later, Robert finds Pushkin at his Moscow mansion, kills the guards and tricks him into electrocuting himself. Alina, following her recovery, runs into Robert and shares that she has started a new life with the money that was left at her hospital bed by him. Inspired to continue helping others, Robert responds to online ads requesting help, calling himself The Equalizer.",

    "plot": "John Wick infiltrates a smuggling compound run by Abram Tarasov, who is highly strung following the recent deaths of his nephew Iosef and brother Viggo at John's hands. There, he recovers his stolen Boss 429 Mustang and kills all of Abram's men in a violent rampage, but spares Abram himself under the promise of peace. Returning home, he sends his Mustang off to be repaired by Aurelio and attempts to restart his life of quietude. That night, John is visited by the Camorra crime boss Santino D'Antonio, who, given John's brief return from retirement, is now seeking his services. John is bound by a \"marker\" (a medallion symbolizing a blood oath) with Santino, who had helped him complete the \"impossible task\" that allowed him to retire and marry Helen. Nevertheless, John refuses, prompting Santino to destroy his house with a grenade launcher. After surviving Santino's attack, he travels to the Continental Hotel in New York City, where Winston reminds him that the underworld has two unbreakable rules: no \"conducting business\" (i.e., assassinations) on Continental grounds, and honoring the marker. To avoid a death sentence, John reluctantly accepts Santino's marker and is tasked with assassinating Santino's sister Gianna, allowing Santino to claim her seat at the \"High Table,\" a council of twelve high-level crime bosses in the underworld. Santino sends Ares, his mute bodyguard, to observe John's mission. In Rome, John makes his way through Gianna's coronation and finds her in her dressing room. Faced with certain death, she chooses to slit her wrists, after which he shoots her in the head to end her suffering and fulfill Santino's marker. While leaving the site, John is attacked by Gianna's bodyguard, Cassian, forcing him to flee to the nearby catacombs, where he is double-crossed by Ares, who intends to kill him to tie up loose ends on Santino's behalf. After killing most of Ares' henchmen, Cassian again pursues John, with the ensuing fight leading them into the Rome Continental, where they are stopped from \"conducting business\". John explains that he was forced to kill Gianna due to her brother's marker. Cassian, while understanding, tells him that he cannot let the assassination go unpunished, but promises to grant him a quick death. The Rome Continental's manager, Julius, gives John safe passage back to New York. Santino has opened a contract to have John assassinated, ostensibly to avenge his sister's death. As John fights off numerous assassins, Winston visits Santino and confirms the marker's fulfillment, thus freeing John from being unable to defy or harm Santino. In the New York City Subway, John encounters Cassian, and the two men engage in a grueling melee that ends with Cassian being stabbed in the aorta and left for dead. Now severely injured, John seeks aid from an underground crime boss known as the \"Bowery King.\" Intrigued by his intent to kill a member of the High Table, the Bowery King sportingly gives John a Kimber M1911 pistol with seven bullets—one for each million of the contract. He also directs him to an art museum, where Santino holds a gala. John attacks the museum and kills all of Santino's subordinates, including Ares, whose actions buy time for Santino to escape to the Continental, where he boasts about remaining in sanctuary indefinitely. Despite Winston's calls for restraint, John executes Santino in the Continental lounge. The next day, Winston meets with John and explains that the Camorra has doubled the bounty on John's head, offering it globally. Further, for \"conducting business\" on Continental grounds, per the High Table's rules, Winston is forced to declare John \"excommunicado,\" terminating his privileges and access to underworld resources. However, due to their friendship, Winston delays the excommunicado status by one hour and provides him with a marker for future use. Before leaving, John tells Winston to warn every High Table assassin that he will kill everyone who tries to hunt him down. As John departs, Winston formally initiates the excommunicado contract process, setting it to go live in one hour. Increasingly tense, John begins running as phones around him start to ring.",

Madolyn charters a small airplane to take them to Anchorage so they can transfer to New York City, where she intends for Winston to testify against mobster Moretti. They are piloted by Daryl Booth, a Texan living in Alaska, who explains that the aircraft's radio and GPS is regularly out of order. While shackled in the middle of the plane, Winston spots Daryl's pilot license under the seat in front of him, noticing that the photograph is a different person from \"Daryl.\" He tries to warn Madolyn, who has a headset on and cannot hear him. After a brief conversation with Madolyn, \"Daryl\" mentions how she will go to Seattle after reaching Anchorage. He should not have known this, thus he reveals himself to be a hitman using Daryl's identity with orders to kill Winston. Madolyn manages to subdue him with a taser, and takes over piloting the plane. Using her satellite phone, Madolyn explains the situation to her direct superior, Caroline Van Sant. Caroline tells her that Winston must be kept alive if Moretti is to be brought to justice. Winston had skimmed $1 million from the Moretti crime family during his time working for them. Caroline tells Madolyn that the real Daryl Booth had been tortured to death by \"Daryl,\" and that she will arrange for another pilot to call her to help navigate them to safety. Madolyn begins to grow suspicious of Caroline when \"Daryl\" knows information about her past that he should not have known—information that could only have come from the Marshals. Thus, Madolyn begins to suspect that Caroline is the leak to the mob. Madolyn then gets in touch with FBI Director Coleridge to explain her suspicions. However, Coleridge gives himself away as being on Moretti's payroll when he mentions his beach house, since Winston recognizes that a past request for payment came from a URL in that city. This puts Caroline's life in danger, since Coleridge needs her to take the fall for any suspicions, lest he becomes a suspect. \"Daryl\" wakes up, shackled to the overhead rack, and taunts Winston, promising to make him suffer, as well as to kill his mother, whose address he knows. He also reveals that Madolyn had been put on desk duty for several years after her neglect had caused the death of a witness in her custody during her last field mission; Madolyn permitted the witness to take a shower unsupervised, albeit handcuffed, when their motel room was firebombed by a cartel hitman, and Madolyn fled while forgetting the witness could not escape. Hassan, a pilot on the ground in Anchorage, calls Madolyn and teaches her how to steer the plane; he also calms her and says they will go drinking and dancing when she lands safely. \"Daryl\" manages to free himself from his handcuffs and attacks the pair. He stabs Winston twice and begins to strangle Madolyn with the seatbelt. She is about to pass out when Winston removes the knife from his chest and cuts the belt, allowing Madolyn to shoot \"Daryl\" with a flare gun, incapacitating him at the back of the plane. When Coleridge calls Madolyn and tells her that Caroline has been killed in a car accident, she vows to bring him down alongside Moretti. A US Navy F/A-18 Hornet meets the plane to escort it to the airport. With Winston now in dire need of medical attention, Hassan guides Madolyn into landing the plane as quickly as possible, which burns through their remaining fuel supply. On the approach, \"Daryl\" regains consciousness, almost degloves his hand in order to extract it from the handcuffs, and attacks again. He is shot by Madolyn and thrown off the plane, where he is run over by an ambulance, as Madolyn manages a successful crash landing. Winston is rushed into an ambulance by the ground crew as Madolyn is greeted by Hassan. Madolyn notices that a suspicious-looking paramedic has entered the ambulance, and she quickly makes her way to the ambulance, finding that the fake paramedic is using a plastic bag to smother Winston. Madolyn shoots the paramedic before he can kill Winston. Madolyn picks up the paramedic's phone, revealing him as a hitman acting under orders from Coleridge, who is on the other end of the line. She tells Coleridge that he is finished, before sharing a caring moment with Winston, who smiles wanly.",

    "plot": "Sara Wulf is a former Special Forces soldier who served in Afghanistan until 2017. She was the only survivor of an ambush in which eight soldiers were killed. Sara and her young son Joshua (Josh) visit the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt to apply for a work visa. During their lengthy stay, she leaves Josh in a playroom; when she returns, he is gone. Sara asks Regional Security Officer Eric Kynch and Sergeant Donovan for help. According to Donovan, Sara entered the consulate alone and no child was checked in, and the surveillance footage also shows only Sara without her son. Sara contacts the German police, but German authorities have no authority in American extraterritorial territory. Her mother, Anja, does not believe her either; she suspects that Sara has not taken her post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) pills. Sara is deemed to be having a psychiatric episode, and she is asked to leave the consulate. Instead, Sara goes into hiding in the building and searches for Josh. There she meets Irina, who has been held captive at the consulate for almost two months. Irina offers to help her find Josh, in return for helping her to leave the consulate. Sara finds a bag of illegal drugs in an employee's locker at the consulate, so she suspects Josh may have been kidnapped because he witnessed the transaction. After consulate security finds Sara, Kynch injects her with a sedative and she falls unconscious. When she wakes up, Consul General Deborah Allen is at her bedside. She was contacted by Sara's mother, who is concerned about Sara's PTSD and her delusions following her deployment to Afghanistan, during which Joshua's father was also killed. Later, Sara is freed by Irina, whose real name is Kira Volkova. Her father was a Belarusian dissident and was killed by the Russian government. Kira fled to the US embassy in Minsk; the CIA had brought her to Frankfurt. Kira wants to go to Boston to see her mother, and from there, by sharing incriminating data about Russian crimes on a USB stick, she hopes to free other dissidents. Sara has a job offer with a security firm in the US that is recruiting female ex-soldiers. She discovers that Kynch is behind the offer as a ruse to get her into the consulate and kidnap her, as he was also in Afghanistan. Sara had received a video from a journalist showing Kynch meeting with a Taliban militant. According to the journalist, Kynch is corrupt and was responsible for tipping off the Taliban and enabling them to ambush Sara's group. Sara launches a diversion so Kira can escape to the US via France. Kynch admits to Sara that he kidnapped Josh and tampered with the surveillance footage. As Sara was the last surviving witness to the Afghanistan incident, and Kynch felt threatened by the journalist's evidence, so his plan was to get Sara concerned about her son and let her run amok in the consulate so he could shoot her in self-defense. Sara kidnaps Kynch's daughter Aileen and takes her to a safe room. She initially tries to trade her for Josh, but then changes her mind and releases her. Sara later secretly records Kynch's confession on Aileen's digital recorder. Kynch himself was a soldier and felt unsupported by the military in dealing with trauma, as well as financially disadvantaged. Therefore, he made a deal with the Taliban to sell information and improve his financial situation. After Sara is shot and injured by Kynch, Josh is freed. Eight weeks later, Sara calls Kira; Kynch is now in custody in the US. Donovan and the man at the check-in desk were also involved in Kynch's kidnapping plan. Sara travels to the US with Josh and plans to meet Kira there.",

    "plot": "In New York City, John Wick is grieving the death of his wife Helen, who had arranged for him to receive a beagle puppy, Daisy, to help cope with his loss. A few days later, a group of Russian gangsters led by Iosef Tarasov accost John at a gas station and fail to intimidate him into selling them his 1969 Boss 429 Mustang. That night, they break into John's home, assault him, kill the puppy, and steal the car. Iosef takes the Mustang to a chop shop to remove its identifying details, but the shop owner, Aurelio, recognizes it and refuses service. Aurelio informs John that Iosef is the son of Viggo Tarasov, the boss of New York City's Russian Mafia. Upon learning of his son's actions, Viggo berates Iosef for incurring John's wrath. He reveals John was once a hitman in his employ, and was renowned and feared in the criminal underworld as the \"Baba Yaga\", a ruthless, relentless \"man of focus, commitment, and sheer will\". After John fell in love with Helen, a civilian, Viggo gave him a seemingly impossible task to earn his freedom; he succeeded. John recovers a concealed stash from his former career that includes weapons and gold coins. He rejects Viggo's attempt to make amends and kills the hit squad subsequently sent to his home. Viggo puts a $2 million bounty on John and enlists John's former mentor, Marcus, to kill him. John lodges at the Continental, a luxurious hotel that serves as neutral ground for the underworld and where conducting criminal business is strictly forbidden. Winston, the hotel's owner and John's old friend, informs him that Iosef is at a nightclub called Red Circle. John infiltrates Red Circle and confronts Iosef, but he is attacked by Viggo's henchman Kirill and forced to retreat to the Continental for medical attention. As John rests, a hitwoman, Ms. Perkins, sneaks into his room. Marcus sees Perkins from an adjacent building and fires a warning shot to alert John, who wakes up and subdues her. Perkins reveals that Viggo has doubled the bounty for her to kill John in the hotel and has concealed a high-value stash in a church. John hires another hitman, Harry, to secure Perkins, but she kills Harry and escapes. At the church, John destroys Viggo's cache of cash and extensive blackmail material. When Viggo arrives to assess the damage, John assaults him and his men but is hit by Kirill's car and captured. John tells Viggo he will not stop until Iosef is dead because the puppy gave him hope and a chance to not be alone in his grief for Helen. Marcus again intervenes to save John, who kills Kirill and threatens Viggo into revealing Iosef's location in a safe house. John attacks the safehouse and kills Iosef. Marcus encourages John to return to his everyday life. Perkins witnesses this and reveals Marcus's duplicity to Viggo, who has him tortured and killed. Viggo calls John to taunt him with the details, drawing him back to the city. Winston has Perkins executed for breaking the Continental's rules, then informs John that Viggo is preparing to leave the city by helicopter. John races to New York Harbor, where he fights and mortally wounds Viggo. John, resigned to dying from his injuries, watches a video on his phone of Helen telling him they need to go home. He breaks into a nearby animal clinic, treats his wounds, and adopts a pit bull puppy scheduled to be euthanized before beginning to walk home.",

    "plot": "1847: A king with a great kingdom in coastal Karnataka lived with his loving wife and children but could not find peace. He sets out on a journey to discover spirituality and bliss. He comes upon a holy stone in a forest occupied by the demigod Panjurli, who protects the forest's villagers. He donates a vast portion of his land to the villagers in exchange for taking the holy stone with him. Panjurli warns the king, through a human-medium, that his family and successors should keep their word and not reclaim the land; if they do, then they will incur the wrath of Panjurli's companion, the ferocious demon Guliga. 1970: The king's descendant asks a Bhoota Kola performer, who is possessed by Panjurli to make the locals hand over the land to him, which the performer refuses and states that if the former goes to court to decide on the land's custody, then the Daiva will deliver his verdict on the stairs of the court. The descendant is skeptical of the performer's possession by Panjurli, to which the performer replies he would vanish if he is possessed, after which he runs into a forest and is indeed never seen again. As warned and professed by the performer, a few months later, on the steps of the court, the king's successor dies mysteriously while en route to argue over the land's possession. 1990: Murali, a forest officer, is tasked with converting the villagers' land into a forest reserve. However, he is challenged by Shiva, a Kambala athlete and the missing performer's son from the Kaadubettu village. Shiva is backed by his patron and the village's landlord, Devendra Suttooru, who is the king's descendant. Although Shiva has repeatedly been asked to perform the Bhoota Kola, he refuses due to the trauma of his father's disappearance. Instead, his cousin, Guruva, takes his place. Murali and his staff start erecting a fence along the earmarked forest reserve, and Shiva falls in love with his childhood friend, Leela. He uses his connections with Devendra to appoint her as a forest guard. The villagers try to stop the fencing, but the police and forest guards (including Leela) brutally suppress them, creating a rift between Leela and Shiva even though she was following orders. As the feud between Murali and Shiva intensifies, Murali decides to arrest Shiva and his friends and heads to their hideout along with Devendra's henchman, Sudhakara. While en route to arrest him, Murali's jeep accidentally gets crushed by the trunk of a tree, which was being cut by Shiva. While Murali survives with severe injuries, Shiva and his companions go underground to avoid being arrested. A few days later, they secretly return to the village to meet their families; Shiva makes up with Leela and tells her that he will surrender. However, all of them are caught by the police and forest guards the next morning. Guruva asks Devendra to bail out Shiva, but during their conversation, Devendra tries to bribe him to impersonate being possessed by Panjurli in the next Bhoota Kola and order the villagers to hand over the land, revealing Devendra's true intention of acquiring the land from the villagers. Guruva refuses, and Devendra kills him. Learning that Murali has figured out his ulterior motive, Devendra decides to set Shiva against Murali. Having learnt of Guruva's death, Shiva meets Devendra, who lies to him that Murali is Guruva's killer. Enraged, Shiva goes to kill Murali but learns from his blacksmith friend Mahadeva that Devendra himself killed Guruva. While under the influence of a drug, Shiva is attacked by Devendra's henchmen. He fights them all and makes them retreat. He meets the villagers, whom Murali has already told about Devendra's plan to seize their lands. After Shiva reveals that Devendra killed Guruva, he and Murali unite the village. Devendra and his henchmen arrive at the spot and attack, leading to an intense battle where several of the villagers are killed. After nearly dying in the fight, Shiva hits his head against Panjurli's holy stone. Guliga then possesses him, supernaturally empowering him to kill Devendra and his henchmen. A few months after the battle, Shiva marries Leela and they raise their son together. Shiva performs the Bhoota Kola and is possessed by Panjurli. He, Murali and the villagers join hands in a symbolic gesture. Shiva disappears into the forest after meeting what seems to be his father's spirit. In the mid-credits scene, Shiva and Leela's son asks Sundara about his father's disappearance.",

At the New York Public Library, John retrieves a marker medallion and a rosary. He is injured in a fight with another hitman, Ernest, and seeks medical treatment from an underworld doctor. His excommunicado status activates before the doctor can finish, forcing John to complete the suturing himself. Upon leaving, he is quickly pursued by various gangs of assassins, all of whom he kills. John meets with The Director, the head of the Ruska Roma crime syndicate, to whom he presents a rosary and demands safe passage to Casablanca. As John was once a member, the Director reluctantly agrees. Meanwhile, a High Table Adjudicator meets with New York Continental manager Winston Scott and the Bowery King, notifying them that they both have seven days to resign from their positions as a consequence of helping John. The Adjudicator enlists Zero, a Japanese assassin, and orders him to stab the Director through both of her hands as penance for aiding John. In Casablanca, John meets Sofia Al-Azwar, his former friend who is now the manager of the Moroccan Continental. John presents the marker, which binds Sofia to repay a debt to John (John had previously rescued Sofia's daughter and placed her in hiding). John demands to be directed to the Elder, the only person above the High Table, who alone can rescind John's excommunicado status. Sofia begrudgingly takes John to Berrada, her former boss, who tells John he may find the Elder only by wandering through the desert until he can no longer walk. When Sofia refuses to give Berrada one of her trained Belgian Malinois in return for his help, he shoots the dog, but hits its bulletproof vest. John prevents Sofia from killing Berrada. They fight their way out of the kasbah and drive into the desert, where she leaves John. Seven days later, the Adjudicator and Zero confront the Bowery King, who refuses to abdicate his position. In response, Zero's students slaughter the Bowery King's men while Zero slashes the Bowery King seven times with a wakizashi. Meanwhile, John collapses in the desert and is brought to the Elder. John states that he wants to live to keep the memory of the love he once had with his late wife. The Elder agrees to forgive John under the condition of killing Winston and subservience to the High Table for the remainder of his life. To show his fealty, John severs his ring finger and gives his wedding ring to The Elder. Upon returning to New York, John is attacked by Zero and his students before reaching the protection of the Continental. The Adjudicator arrives, but Winston refuses to abdicate, and John refuses to kill him, leading the Adjudicator to revoke the Continental's neutral status and send both Zero and an army of heavily armed High Table enforcers to kill John and Winston. Winston provides John with weapons and the assistance of concierge Charon and his staff. After killing all the enforcers, Zero and his students ambush John; John proceeds to kill all but two. Zero battles John, but is eventually defeated and left to die. On the roof of the Continental, The Adjudicator agrees to a parley with Winston, who offers allegiance to the High Table. John arrives; Winston shoots him, and he falls to the street below. Winston reassumes his position, and the severely injured John is secretly delivered to the Bowery King in an underground bunker; the two agree to join forces against the High Table.",

After a firefight breaks out against the Abu Sayyaf, Sergeant JJ Kinney – a young Air Force TACP (callsign \"Playboy\") attached to the Delta Force team as its JTAC – is seemingly the only survivor and is directed to an extraction point, relying only on the Reaper's remote air support. Once Kinney arrives, he is intercepted by the Abu Sayyaf forces, depleting the ammunition of Grimm's drone (consisting of AGM-114 Hellfire and BLU-118 munitions) and forcing the endangered extraction helicopter to leave. Trying to reach another extraction point, Kinney falls down a hill and loses his rifle, runs out of ammunition for his pistol, and then gets captured. One of his squad mates, Master Sergeant John \"Sugar\" Sweet, turns out to be alive and rescues Kinney, while telling him Sergeant Bishop was taken prisoner in Abu Sayyaf's base in a series of caves, at their initial mission location. Using Sweet's radio, Kinney contacts Grimm, who schedules three bombings to hit the base, each 15 minutes apart, before Grimm and Branson are forced by their superiors to take a leave for having exceeded their duty day. Kinney and Sweet raid one of Sayyaf's facilities before being captured and taken to their prison. Sweet is executed right as the first superficial bombing hits, and Kinney is taken to be tortured, where the rebel leader does not believe his warning about the upcoming bombings till it was too late. After the explosion, Kinney survives due to having been dunked in a water tub, while his captors are caught in the flames. Kinney grabs a machete and kills the surviving leader, taking his satellite phone and calling Nellis Air Force Base for Grimm to call off the third bombing, before the battery runs out. The base crew, distracted by a March Madness game, dismisses Kinney's call and redirects him to Grimm's private phone. Grimm does not answer, being in a call with his very pregnant wife while grocery shopping, so Kinney leaves a voice mail, and leaves seeking the other prisoners. Returning to Bishop and searching for a way out, they also find the CIA operative, whom Grimm and Branson had been lied to that he was found elsewhere by another agency's operation. At the grocery store checkout, Grimm hears Kinney's voicemail and immediately leaves, trying to call Nellis while driving to the base. As no one answers, Grimm is forced to rush to the control room and order the B-1 Lancer pilot to abort the bombing, right as it flies in front of Kinney, Bishop, and the CIA agent reaching the cave's entrance. As the soldiers are finally extracted in the Philippines, Grimm complains to the rest of the base crew and his superiors that three men nearly died because they were too distracted to hear their calls, despite being repeatedly asked to pay attention to the phone because of his pregnant wife, and he smashes the break room's main television in anger. Afterwards he convenes with Branson in a hangar, where she asks him to walk her down the aisle in her wedding, and he agrees and leads her in a dance.",

    "plot": "In an animated short entitled \"Me and My Shadow\", the Joker is impersonated by his shadow, who acts violently and takes his place to perform a musical number for a TV show, then merges back together with the Joker before three police officers arrive and attack him. Arthur Fleck is in custody at Arkham State Hospital awaiting trial for the crimes he committed two years prior. His lawyer Maryanne Stewart plans to argue that Arthur suffers from dissociative identity disorder and that his Joker personality is responsible for the crimes. At a music therapy session, Arthur meets Harley \"Lee\" Quinzel, who claims that she grew up in the same neighborhood he did, had an abusive father who died in a car crash, and was imprisoned after burning down her parents' apartment building. Lee also expresses her admiration for Joker's crimes and personality. As their relationship develops, they begin imagining life as a stage musical with them in the spotlight through their linked insanity. During a film screening, Lee starts a fire. She and Arthur are caught trying to escape, and Arthur is placed in solitary confinement. Lee visits him to say she is being released to prevent him from influencing her, but promises to attend his trial. They have sex before she leaves. During an interview with a television personality, Arthur sings to Lee through the TV screen, deepening her love for him. On the day of the trial, Assistant District Attorney Harvey Dent calls witnesses who dismiss Arthur's claims of insanity, including his old neighbor Sophie Dumond. During a break, Maryanne reveals that Lee was actually a psychiatry student who grew up on the Upper West Side, and her father, a doctor, is alive. Furthermore, she voluntarily committed herself at Arkham, checked herself out, and never burned down an apartment building. When Arthur confronts Lee, she confesses that her lies were an effort to get close to Arthur but also tells him that she is pregnant from their night together and has moved into his old apartment building to create a home for them. Afterward he imagines a scenario where they are singing on television before she shoots him dead. At the trial the next day, Arthur dismisses Maryanne and represents himself. After bringing Arthur's former co-worker Gary Puddles to the stand, Harvey rests his case. Visibly affected by Gary's testimony, Arthur offers no defense. During his speech, he mocks the Arkham guards and indicates that they abuse him. Returning to Arkham, he is taken to the showers by head guard Jackie Sullivan and two guards in retaliation, where he is beaten and brought to his cell pantless. An inmate and friend of Arthur's named Ricky verbally confronts the guards, resulting in Jackie garroting him to death. The event visibly devastates him. During his closing argument in court the following day, Arthur renounces his Joker persona, taking full responsibility for his actions. Enraged at this, Lee walks out, and the jury finds Arthur guilty of murder. As the foreperson reads the verdict, a bomb explodes outside the courthouse, killing and injuring numerous attendees and scarring half of Harvey's face. In the chaos, two followers help Arthur escape, but he abandons them when he realizes they only see him as Joker. Arthur wanders through Gotham City and encounters Lee on the stairs outside his old apartment, but she rejects him for renouncing his Joker persona. As she leaves, the police apprehend Arthur and bring him back to Arkham. The next day, a guard directs Arthur down an empty hallway to meet a visitor. A young inmate stops Arthur and begins telling a joke before repeatedly stabbing Arthur in the abdomen with a shank. As Arthur falls to the floor and bleeds to death, the inmate, laughing hysterically, carves a smile on his own face. As Arthur lies dying the scenario where Lee shoots him is revisited.",

While leaving the winery, Vitale's grandson shoots McCall in the back. McCall contemplates suicide due to the injury, but reconsiders and then takes the ferry back to the mainland. While driving on the Amalfi Coast, McCall pulls over and slips into unconsciousness from shock. Gio Bonucci, a local carabiniere (a type of law enforcement officer), encounters and rescues him. He brings McCall to the remote coastal Italian town Altamonte, where Dr. Enzo Arisio treats him. As he recovers, McCall becomes acquainted with the locals and grows fond of them and their village. Anonymously, he places a telephone call to CIA officer Emma Collins to tip her off about the winery's clandestine role in the illegal drug trade. Collins and other CIA operatives discover enormous amounts of cash as well as bags of fenethylline tablets hidden in a storeroom, confirming McCall's suspicions. She locates McCall in Altamonte, and they continue to cooperate. Meanwhile, members of the Camorra (run by brothers Vincent and Marco Quaranta) harass and kill villagers in an attempt to coerce them out of their housing and take over Altamonte for commercialization purposes. McCall overhears Marco pressuring local store owner Angelo for payments (similar to extortion). To make an example of Angelo, the Camorra firebombs his fish store as the town watches. Gio reviews video of the firebombing and calls the Italian central police for an inquiry. Having captured Gio's wife and daughter to lure him, the Camorra attack Gio and beat him for interfering in their operations. They had been alerted by an informant within the police. Marco demands that Gio set up a boat for him with contacts in Somalia to expand his operations. Overhearing the conversation, McCall asks Marco to move his operations to a different location to leave the townspeople alone. When he refuses, McCall kills him and his henchmen. An enraged Vincent threatens and tortures the Naples police chief and instructs him to find the person responsible for Marco's death. Collins' car is rigged with a bomb by Vincent, but she survives the blast and is instead hospitalized. Vincent returns to Altamonte, and, in front of the townspeople, threatens to kill Gio unless Marco's killer is identified. McCall reveals himself, but the citizens begin to protest, recording Vincent and his henchmen with their camera phones as he prepares to execute McCall. Vincent and his cadre retreat. They regroup at his mansion, planning to retaliate the following day. That night, McCall infiltrates Vincent's mansion. He kills Vincent's bodyguards one by one and administers to Vincent a lethal dose of the drugs Vincent had been selling throughout Europe. Through Collins, McCall transfers cash he had taken from the winery, to an elderly couple who had lost that amount when their pension fund was hacked and looted. At CIA headquarters, Collins receives a promotion for her contribution to ending the Altamonte drug trade. She receives a package that contains a book of contacts and a note from McCall. He congratulates her and states that her mother would be proud of her; thus revealing Collins is the daughter of his late friend and colleague, Susan Plummer. As the danger of the Quaranta brothers has been removed, McCall celebrates with the locals in Altamonte after their football team's victory.",

    "plot": "A group of al-Qaeda-backed local rebels disguised as lab technicians, led by Rasheed (Dick Israel), stage a raid on the Sultan Kudarat Airbase, home of the Joint U.S. Tactical Command in the Philippines. They manage to seize control of a \"ground control encoder\", an American device that locks out the controls and instruments in an aircraft, allowing it to be remotely controlled from the ground. The encoder was designed to prevent aircraft hijackings in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, but the rebels intend to use it to cause another aircraft suicide attack. With three airborne airliners as possible targets, the terrorists send out a warning that they will not hesitate to crash them and kill those on board in their attacks on government facilities. Despite efforts to stop them, the terrorists crash the first airliner into the airbase, destroying most of the aircraft and helicopters in the base and killing the occupants. Barely escaping the attack on the airbase, pilot Captain Amy Jennings (Theresa Randle) appeals to her commanding officer, Colonel Halloran (Jeff Fahey), to airlift the U.S. Marines Strike Force Team, led by Captain Matt Daniels (Mark Dacascos), to defeat the rebels. The team is flown into the Philippines jungle to track down the rebels outside the airport perimeter. Once within striking distance, Jennings disobeys orders and rappels down to join Daniels and his team. The rebels are defeated, but they are revealed to be a decoy; in retaliation, the rebels crash the second airliner, and plan to use the last one against a nearby city. Captain Daniels is ordered to return with his team, where they learn the rebels are using a broadcast company building as their headquarters. Captain Jennings airlifts Daniels and his team, but they are intercepted by armed rebels; only Daniels and Jennings survive. Daniels takes out Rasheed's right-hand man and Jennings pursues Rasheed, who flees on a motorcycle. Jennings and Daniels pursue him in a helicopter, manage to catch up to and kill Rasheed, and take the encoder.",

Dom tries to help Letty Ortiz regain her memory, while Brian accustoms himself to life as a father. Meanwhile, Owen's elder brother Deckard Shaw breaks into the hospital, where the comatose Owen is held in London and vows to exact revenge. Deckard breaks into the DSS field office in LA to extract profiles of Dom's crew and fights Luke Hobbs before he escapes, detonating a bomb that severely injures Hobbs. Dom learns from his sister Mia that she is pregnant again and convinces her to tell Brian. However, a letter bomb sent by Deckard, who has presumably killed Han Lue in Tokyo, explodes and destroys the Toretto house. Dom meets Hobbs and learns about Deckard before he travels to Tokyo to retrieve Han's body and acquires the objects found at the crash site from Sean Boswell. As Dom, Brian, Tej Parker and Roman Pearce mourn Han and Gisele Yashar at Han's funeral in LA, Dom spots Deckard spying on them and confronts him in an underground tunnel, but Deckard flees when a covert ops team, led by government agent Mr. Nobody, arrives. Mr. Nobody tells Dom that he will help them in stopping Deckard if he helps him retrieve God's Eye, a computer program capable of tracking a specific individual using anything on a digital network, and save its creator Ramsey from Mose Jakande, a Nigerian terrorist. The team airdrops their off-road modified cars over the Caucasus Mountains in Azerbaijan and ambush Jakande's convoy, where they rescue Ramsey and leave for the Etihad Towers in Abu Dhabi. They steal the flash drive containing the God's Eye chip from a billionaire hidden in a Lykan HyperSport. With God's Eye secure, Dom, Brian, Nobody, and his team use it to hunt Deckard to an abandoned factory, but are ambushed by Jakande and his henchmen, who have allied with Deckard, and are forced to flee while Jakande obtains God's Eye. Mr. Nobody is medically extracted, while the team returns to LA. Dom plans to fight Deckard alone, while Letty, Brian, Tej and Roman resolve to protect Ramsey from Jakande. Brian promises Mia that he will fully dedicate himself to their family after he defeats Deckard and Jakande. As Jakande pursues Brian and the rest of the team with a stealth helicopter and an aerial drone, Ramsey attempts to hack into God's Eye. Discovering the situation, Hobbs leaves the hospital and destroys the drone with an ambulance. After battling and killing Jakande's henchman Kiet, Brian hijacks a signal repeater tower that allows Ramsey to control God's Eye and shut it down. As the military closes into the city, Jakande attempts to flee and spots Dom and Deckard engaging in a brawl atop a public parking garage. Intervening, Jakande turns on Deckard and attacks both men. Dom uses the distraction to defeat Deckard by causing part of the parking garage to collapse beneath him. Dom attempts to crash his Dodge Charger onto Jakande's helicopter, where he leaves a bag of grenades on the helicopter and crashes on the rubble of the garage. Hobbs shoots the grenades, destroying the helicopter and killing Jakande. After Brian and Hobbs help Letty bring out Dom's unconscious body, Letty cradles Dom and tells him that she has fully regained her memories and has remembered their wedding. Dom regains consciousness. Deckard is arrested by Hobbs and CIA, where he is locked up in a black site prison. The rest of the team relaxes on a tropical beach. Brian and Mia play with their son Jack, while Dom, Letty, Roman, Tej, and Ramsey look on, acknowledging that Brian is happily retired with his family. Dom drives away and Brian catches up with him.

    "plot": "In 1979, Michael Corleone is approaching 60 years of age. Plagued with guilt over his ruthless rise to power, especially for having ordered his brother Fredo Corleone's murder, he donates millions to charitable causes. Michael and Kay Adams are divorced; their children Anthony and Mary live with Kay. At a reception in Michael's honor at St. Patrick's Old Cathedral that follows a papal order induction ceremony, Anthony tells his father that he is leaving law school to become an opera singer. Kay supports Anthony's decision, while Michael eventually agrees to let him go his own way. Kay reveals to Michael that she and Anthony know the truth about Fredo's death. Vincent Mancini, the illegitimate son of Michael's long-dead brother Sonny by his mistress Lucy Mancini, arrives at the reception. Michael's sister Connie arranges for Vincent to settle a dispute with his rival Joey Zasa, but Zasa calls Vincent a bastard, and Vincent bites Zasa's ear. Michael, troubled by Vincent's temper yet impressed by his loyalty, agrees to include Vincent in the family business. The head of the Vatican Bank, Archbishop Gilday, has accumulated a massive deficit of $769M. Michael offers $600M in exchange for the Vatican's shares in an international real estate company, Internazionale Immobiliare (a fictional company, but possibly a reference to the real-world Società Generale Immobiliare), which would give him a controlling interest. Immobiliare's board approves the offer, pending ratification by Pope Paul VI. Don Altobello, a New York Mafia boss and Connie's godfather, tells Michael that his partners on The Commission want to be involved with the Immobiliare deal. However, wanting to finally become legitimate, Michael pays them to sell his Las Vegas holdings instead. Zasa receives nothing and, declaring Michael to be his enemy, storms out. Don Altobello, assuring Michael that he can diplomatically resolve the matter, leaves to speak to Zasa. Moments later, a helicopter hovers outside the conference room and opens fire. Most bosses are killed, but Michael, Vincent, and Michael's bodyguard Al Neri, escape. Michael realizes that Altobello is the traitor, and suffers a diabetic stroke. As Michael recuperates, Vincent and Mary begin a romance, while Neri and Connie permit Vincent to retaliate against Zasa. During a street festival, Vincent kills Zasa. Michael berates Vincent for his actions and insists that Vincent end his relationship with Mary because it is dangerous and they are first cousins. The family goes to Sicily for Anthony's operatic debut in Palermo at the Teatro Massimo. Michael tells Vincent to pretend to defect from the Corleone family to spy on Altobello. Altobello introduces Vincent to Licio Lucchesi, Immobiliare's chairman. Michael visits Cardinal Lamberto, anticipated to become the next pope, to discuss the deal. Lamberto persuades Michael to make his first confession in 30 years, during which Michael tearfully confesses that he ordered Fredo's murder. Lamberto says that Michael deserves to suffer for his sins, but can be redeemed. He gives him sacramental absolution, permanently forgiving all his past sins in the eyes of God. Michael discovers that the Immobiliare deal is an elaborate swindle, arranged by Lucchesi, Gilday and Vatican accountant Frederick Keinszig. Vincent tells Michael that Altobello has hired Mosca, a veteran hitman, to assassinate Michael. Mosca, disguised as a priest, kills Corleone family friend Don Tommasino as he returns to his villa. While Michael and Kay tour Sicily, Michael asks for Kay's forgiveness, and they admit that they still love each other. At Tommasino's funeral, Michael vows to sin no more. Following the pope's death, Cardinal Lamberto is elected to succeed him, choosing as his name Pope John Paul I. Subsequently, the Immobiliare deal is ratified. Gilday kills the new pope with poisoned tea. Michael names Vincent the new Don of the Corleone family, in return for ending his romance with Mary. The family sees Anthony's performance in Cavalleria rusticana in Palermo while Vincent exacts his revenge. Keinszig is killed, and his murder is staged as a suicide; Connie poisons Altobello via a birthday cannoli and watches him die from the opera box; Calò, Tommasino's former bodyguard, kills Lucchesi; and Neri travels to the Vatican, where he shoots and kills Gilday. At the opera house during Anthony's performance, three of Vincent's men search for Mosca, but he overcomes them. After the show, on the opera house steps as they leave, Mosca shoots at Michael, wounding him; a second bullet hits Mary, killing her. Vincent shoots and kills Mosca. Michael cradles Mary's body and screams in agony and horror. Seventeen years later, an elderly and depressed Michael, sitting alone in the courtyard of Don Tommasino's villa, suffers a stroke. He slumps over, and falls to the ground, dead.",

His friend Joo-hwan collects him, but Dae-su disappears and awakens in a sealed hotel room. Takeout food is delivered through a pet door, and his only diversion is a television; from it, Dae-su learns that he has been framed for his wife's murder. As years pass, Dae-su grows deranged from solitude and attempts suicide by wrist-cutting, but is resuscitated. Dae-su then begins practicing martial arts against the wall and attempting to dig an escape tunnel. In 2003, Dae-su is sedated, hypnotised, and released after 15 years. He awakens on a rooftop, where he saves a suicidal man and recounts his story; once finished, Dae-su allows the man to commit suicide. Dae-su receives money and a phone from a beggar, and enters a sushi restaurant. Taunted by his captor over the phone, Dae-su orders and consumes a live octopus before collapsing. He is taken in by the young sushi chef, Mi-do, who reads his journals. Dae-su unsuccessfully attempts to rape her; he regretfully attempts to leave, but they reconcile and bond over their loneliness. Dae-su searches for his daughter, but gives up after learning she was adopted and emigrated. Focusing on his captors, he eats at Chinese restaurants until he identifies which one prepared his prison meals. Chasing a deliveryman, Dae-su finds a private prison where people pay to have others incarcerated. He tortures and interrogates the warden, Mr. Park, who divulges that Dae-su was imprisoned for \"talking too much\". Park's guards attack Dae-su, but he fights his way through. Dae-su reconnects with Joo-hwan, who now works at an internet café. Dae-su becomes suspicious of Mi-do and binds her, but his captor calls and sends him to a neighboring apartment. Using the pseudonym \"Evergreen\", he gives Dae-su an ultimatum: if he can uncover his motive within five days, Evergreen will remotely deactivate his pacemaker; otherwise, Evergreen will kill Mi-do. Dae-su returns to Mi-do to find Park and his thugs molesting her. Park prepares to torture Dae-su, but stops when Evergreen sends a briefcase of cash; Dae-su threatens to remove Park's hand, but Park leaves. Mi-do is upset by the ultimatum, but she and Dae-su grow closer and have sex in a love hotel. Dae-su wakes to find Park's hand wrapped in a box; he investigates his possessions, and has his shoe debugged. Dae-su and Mi-do follow Evergreen's pseudonym to Dae-su's high-school motto: \"Evergreen Old Boys\". Identifying Evergreen as Lee Woo-jin in a yearbook, Dae-su calls Joo-hwan. Joo-hwan recalls a girl in his class, Lee Soo-ah — who is revealed to be Woo-jin's sister — and crassly describes her sex life and suicide; an eavesdropping Woo-jin angrily stabs Joo-hwan to death. Dae-su seeks out Park, who wants revenge for his hand removal; Park agrees to temporarily imprison Mi-do to keep her safe. Talking to Soo-ah's friends, Dae-su recalls witnessing her having sex with Woo-jin. Unaware it was incest, Dae-su had told Joo-hwan of her promiscuity, who then spread gossip. Woo-jin, in denial of the truth that he got his sister pregnant, claims Soo-ah developed a false pregnancy, which drove her to suicide. At Woo-jin's penthouse, Dae-su reveals Woo-jin's motive. An amused Woo-jin gifts Dae-su a family photo album, the contents revealing that Dae-su's daughter grew up into Mi-do. Woo-jin reveals that he used hypnosis to orchestrate their meeting and incestuous relationship, and that he paid Park to imprison Mi-do. Woo-jin threatens to tell Mi-do the truth, and Dae-su desperately grovels; when Woo-jin is unmoved, Dae-su cuts out his tongue as penance. Woo-jin accepts his apology, instructing Park to not tell Mi-do and dropping his pacemaker remote. Dae-su uses it, but it only plays a recording of Dae-su and Mi-do having sex, making him collapse in despair. Woo-jin leaves the penthouse apparently satisfied with his work. However, he hallucinates his sister's suicide as he is in the elevator and breaks into a flood of tears. Realising that despite his vengeance he will always be tormented by his past, he pulls out his derringer, presses it to his head, and kills himself with the final bullet, symbolising how his revenge only truly hurt himself further. Sometime later, Dae-su locates the hypnotist and requests she erase his knowledge of Mi-do being his daughter. Touched by a specific line in his letter, she guides Dae-su to envision the part of himself that knows the truth dying. A concerned Mi-do finds Dae-su lying alone in the snow. Mi-do confesses her love for him, and the two embrace; Dae-su smiles, but it becomes a tortured grimace.",

During a snowstorm as she drives there, she takes an unintended detour to a nearby cabin, asking a man for directions after she notices blood on the snow that the man attributes to a deer. However, when she reaches the lake, she sees that man pursuing and capturing a young woman with her hands tied. Returning to the cabin to investigate, Barb sees that the woman is tied up in the cabin basement and overhears the man and a woman in purple talking about plans to kill the girl. Unable to get her truck off the frozen lake due to the snow, Barb sets up her husband's old hunting gear as a distraction, luring the couple in so that the man falls into a concealed hole she cut in the ice. Unable to get the girl out of the cabin basement, Barb soaks most of the cabin to force the couple to depart, but they return before Barb can leave and she is shot in the arm as she escapes. With the man suffering from hypothermia, Barb is able to sneak back and make a call on their truck's radio for help, stealing a gun in the process, but the man interrupts her. She learns that his wife is sick and the girl was chosen because of a previous suicide attempt, but Barb convinces the man to drive to the nearest town and get the police before going to the hospital himself. Barb sets up her truck to explode to draw in more help, and meets a couple of hunters. They take her back to the cabin to try to help the girl, but the woman shoots them both, having already killed her husband, capturing Barb after Barb manages to shoot her in the leg. Stuck in the basement with the girl, Barb learns that the girl's name is Leah, but their next escape attempt is interrupted when the woman returns and forces them both to accompany her to the lake at gunpoint. Arriving at a makeshift medical tent in the middle of the lake, Barb and Leah learn that the woman intends to take Leah's liver and go to another town to meet a surgeon who can transplant Leah's liver into the woman. Barb is forced to tie Leah up, but deliberately leaves the bonds loose, and is able to take the woman by surprise when her attempt to shoot Barb strikes the box containing her husband's ashes. As Leah cuts herself free with a nail Barb slipped her earlier, Barb forces the woman out onto the ice, back to the hole she dug previously. With both women wounded, Barb uses the handcuffs that were previously used to keep her trapped to tie herself to the woman and throw them both into the hole in the ice. Barb scatters her husband's ashes in the lake as they both sink. Leah escapes her bonds and finds an old photograph of Barb and her husband.",

    "plot": "British diplomat and avid horticulturalist Justin Quayle is confronted by Amnesty International activist Tessa during a lecture in London. They strike up a romance, and marry after she accompanies him to his posting in Kenya. She befriends Belgian doctor Arnold Bluhm, leading to rumours of an affair. Tessa has no qualms confronting corruption, to the chagrin of Justin's superiors, and she loses a child late in pregnancy. Tessa and Arnold connect recent local deaths to drug trials being conducted by the Kenyan-based company Three Bees using the drug Dypraxa. They write a damaging report on the drug and Tessa gives it to Justin's colleague Sandy Woodrow, the British High Commissioner, who sends it to Sir Bernard Pellegrin, head of the Africa Desk at the Foreign Office. Pellegrin responds with an incriminating letter to Sandy, which Tessa persuades him to show her, and she steals it before departing for Lokichogio with Arnold. Sandy informs Justin that a white woman and black driver have been killed near Lake Turkana, and that Tessa and Arnold shared a room at Lodwar before hiring a car. Justin and Sandy identify Tessa's mutilated body, but Arnold's whereabouts remain unknown. Police confiscate Tessa's computer and files, but Justin finds her keepsake box, containing a letter from Sandy declaring his love for her and asking her to return Pellegrin's letter, and records of Three Bees' tests. After Tessa's burial, Justin learns from his colleague Ghita that Tessa kept Arnold's secret that he was gay, as homosexuality is illegal in Kenya. Pursuing the truth about his wife's murder, he follows the trail of her report. Justin is briefly detained by police and confronts Three Bees' CEO Kenny Curtiss, but receives no answers. Returning to London, Justin's passport is confiscated. He dines with Pellegrin, who lies that Arnold must have murdered Tessa, and believes that Justin has his incriminating letter. Justin meets with Tessa's cousin and lawyer Ham, and they access her computer files to reveal her investigation into Dypraxa and its manufacturer, Swiss-Canadian pharmaceutical conglomerate KDH, which hired Three Bees to test the drug on unsuspecting Kenyans as a treatment for tuberculosis. Justin receives a threatening note and Ham provides him with a fake passport to travel to Germany to meet with Tessa's contact Birgit. She is part of a pharmaceutical watchdog group and is reluctant to speak due to the targeting of her group. Justin is attacked in his hotel room and warned to stop investigating. Arnold's body is found having been tortured to death, while the announcement of a safe Dypraxa causes KDH's share price to soar. Returning to Kenya, Justin confronts Sandy, who admits that Tessa's report was silenced to save KDH from spending millions redeveloping the drug. Justin is approached by Curtiss, who has been betrayed by KDH, and brought to a mass grave of Dypraxa test subjects. Curtiss points Justin to Dr Lorbeer, Dypraxa's inventor, who has fled to Sudan. Tim Donohue, a friend in British intelligence, confirms that Pellegrin had Tessa and Arnold killed. Unable to convince Justin to return home, he gives him a gun. Justin travels to confront Lorbeer, who is treating remote villagers to atone for the lives claimed by his drug. The village is attacked by raiders, but Justin and Lorbeer escape in a UN aid plane, and Lorbeer reveals that he has Pellegrin's letter. Tessa convinced him to record the truth about Dypraxa, but he changed his mind, instead informing KDH that Tessa and Arnold were en route to expose the company to the UN. Justin convinces the pilot to mail Pellegrin's letter to Ham, and to drop him off at Lake Turkana. Removing the bullets from his gun, his final thoughts are of Tessa before he is killed by KDH's henchmen. In London at Tessa and Justin's memorial service, Pellegrin lies that Justin committed suicide in the same place his wife died. Ham announces the reading of an epistle, but instead reads Pellegrin's letter, exposing the deaths caused by Dypraxa and the subsequent coverup. Pellegrin storms out as Ham implicates the British government, KDH, and public complacency regarding the human cost of medicine they take for granted.",

They soon realize they can look directly into the apartment across the street, where a man with a professional studio is taking photographs of a woman. Pippa and Thomas watch the couple have sex. They jokingly give their neighbors pseudonyms, Margot and Brent. Pippa, who works as a trainee optometrist at L'Optique, receives a bird feeder from her boss as a housewarming gift.

The next day, \"Margot\", whose real name is Julia, visits L'Optique, where she receives an eye exam from Pippa and orders a new set of glasses recommended by her. Julia invites Pippa to hang out. Pippa wants to warn Julia about \"Brent's\" adultery, but Thomas insists that she stop spying on them. Later, Pippa and Julia meet at a spa; Julia reveals that her husband is named Sebastian, or Seb, and is a well-known photographer. Pippa observes Seb having a threesome and throwing a condom away afterwards. She later discovers how to access Julia and Seb's wireless printer, which she uses to anonymously expose Seb's infidelities to Julia, mentioning the condom as proof. Thomas angrily confronts Pippa about being so invested in Julia's and Seb's lives. The next morning, Pippa apologizes to Thomas and promises to stop watching the neighbors. However, they see Seb discover Julia's body in the bathroom after she seemingly slit her own throat. Thomas blames Pippa for Julia's death, breaks up with her, and leaves. Though heartbroken, Pippa continues to watch Seb and one evening follows him to a nearby pub. Seb sits by Pippa and they talk. He persuades her to pose nude for him at his apartment and they have passionate sex. Upon returning home for reconciliation, Thomas consumes part of a drink in the refrigerator and pours the rest into her bird feeder. He notices Pippa having sex with Seb across the street. The next morning, a horrified Pippa finds Thomas dead in their apartment, having apparently hanged himself. Pippa and her friend Ari attend Seb's exhibition, which turns out to be a collaboration with Julia, who is alive. Pippa and Thomas are revealed to be the subjects of the exhibition. Seb and Julia divulge that they own the apartment rented by Pippa and Thomas (whose lease included a clause stating that they consented to be photographed) and knew they were being watched. Distressed, Pippa storms off, finds Seb's studio above her apartment, and trashes it. As she moves out, she notices dead birds on a grate just below her bird feeder. Following an interview promoting their exhibition, Seb and Julia return home to find a congratulatory bottle of wine by their door. As they drink the wine, Pippa sends a message to their printer saying she knows they killed Thomas. They see her spying on them from the rooftop and chase her into L'Optique, where she tells them she deduced that while she was having sex with Seb, Julia drugged Thomas's drink and staged his suicide. Pippa also reveals that she spiked their wine, causing Julia and Seb to faint. Pippa places the two under a LASIK machine, using it to burn their corneas. A new couple, two men, have moved into Pippa and Thomas's former apartment. They observe Seb and Julia in their apartment, both of whom are now blind and unaware of being watched. Pippa, happily, watches Seb and Julia from the rooftop before leaving her binoculars behind.",

    "plot": "In the 1980s in Boston, Irish Mob boss Frank Costello introduces himself to a young Colin Sullivan. Many years later, Sullivan has been groomed as a spy inside the Massachusetts State Police (MSP) and joins the Special Investigation Unit (SIU). Another police academy recruit, Billy Costigan, is selected by Captain Queenan and Sergeant Dignam to go undercover as a criminal and infiltrate Costello's crew. Costigan serves a term in prison for his cover and further commits several crimes, drawing Costello's attention. Sullivan begins dating police psychiatrist Madolyn Madden. Costigan manages to get Costello to recruit him into his organization. Over the next year, Costigan becomes increasingly involved. His mental state declines, but Queenan and Dignam convince him to continue. Costigan begins seeing Madden for his court-ordered therapy. The MSP and Costello both realize they have moles in their respective organizations and task Costigan and Sullivan to find them. Meanwhile, Costigan learns that Costello is a protected FBI informant, sharing his discovery with Queenan. He and Madden have an affair. One night, Costigan follows Costello into an adult theater and witnesses him giving Sullivan an envelope containing information on his crew. Costigan is instructed to get a visual ID of Sullivan but is unsuccessful. When Sullivan realizes he is being followed, he stabs a man, mistaking him for Costigan, and flees. Costigan, fearing Costello will soon discover and kill him for being the mole, calls Queenan to end the undercover operation, but Sullivan has Queenan followed, lying to the other officers that Queenan may be the spy. Sullivan also calls Costello's gang to inform them of the meeting. When Costello's men arrive, Queenan helps Costigan escape before being thrown from the building to his death. This causes a firefight between the police and Costello's men. In the wake of Queenan's murder, both men (Dignam and Sullivan) fight and Dignam is suspended. Timothy Delahunt, one of Costello's henchmen wounded in the gunfight, tells Costigan that he knows he is the mole before succumbing to his wounds. Looking through Queenan's belongings, Sullivan discovers Costello is an FBI informant. A news report reveals that Delahunt was a Boston Police Department undercover officer, but Costello suspects it is a false claim so he would stop looking for the mole. Deciding to turn on him, Sullivan directs the MSP to tail Costello, and a gunfight erupts, killing most of Costello's crew. Sullivan confronts a wounded Costello, who admits to being an FBI informant. They exchange gunfire, and Sullivan kills him. His assignment finished, Costigan goes to Sullivan to reveal his undercover status, unaware he is another mole. After Sullivan leaves the room, Costigan recognises the envelope from the theater on his desk. Realizing Sullivan was Costello's mole, Costigan escapes. When Sullivan finds Costigan gone, he realizes Costigan has discovered the truth and deletes Costigan's records from police computers. Costigan visits Madden, who has told Sullivan but not Costigan she's pregnant, knowing that Sullivan may not be the father, and hands her an envelope, instructing her to open it if something happens to him. Madden finds an envelope in the mail from Costigan to Sullivan containing a CD of Costello's recorded conversations with Sullivan. Fearing Costigan has revealed their affair, she listens to it and leaves Sullivan. Costigan arranges to meet Sullivan on the same rooftop where Queenan was killed, then arrests him. Costigan calls Trooper Brown, an acquaintance from the police academy, but Brown pulls a gun on him when he arrives, unsure who to believe. Saying he has evidence tying Sullivan to Costello, Brown lets Costigan take the elevator. Upon reaching the lobby, Costigan is shot dead by Trooper Barrigan, a friend of Sullivan's who is another of Costello's spies. Brown reaches the lobby but is also killed by Barrigan. Sullivan shoots Barrigan dead, so that he can frame him as the only mole. At Costigan's funeral, Sullivan notices Madden silently crying. He realizes they were involved, but when he attempts to talk to her about the baby, she ignores him. Later, when Sullivan arrives home, Dignam is waiting for him, and, after Sullivan indifferently accepts his fate, Dignam shoots him in the head, killing him before leaving.",

    "plot": "Amaia Salazar returns to the Baztán Valley to investigate suicides that have a mysterious and jarring pattern. She believes that the suicide cases are linked to a murder case that she solved in Northern Spain a year before. Salazar, who is pregnant and about to give birth to a baby boy, returns as the detective from The Invisible Guardian and leads the investigation. She also has to confront the challenges of her mentally ill and disturbed mother Rosario. At the City Court, Amaia Salazar and her team await the trial of Jason Medina who has been accused of the rape, mutilation and murder of his stepdaughter, Johana Márquez. Just before the trial starts, Medina is found dead in the court's bathroom having committed suicide by slashing his wrists, and leaving a little note in a pocket of his pants with just one word written: \"Tartalo\". This event causes Amaia's water to break and she gives birth to a boy, Ibai, in the hospital. Amaia and her American husband James celebrate the birth of their first child. Reinstated to the active service four months later, Amaia is called by her superior to lead investigation into two different cases. First, Monseñor Landero and Padre Sarasola requested Amaia specifically to investigate with secrecy the profanation of a little church where a baby's amputated arm was found in the altar and second, a man incarcerated in Logroño for the murder of his wife, calls for Amaia with the message that he will reveal only to her the location of his wife's corpse. The man commits suicide after giving a note to a prison guard, where only \"Tartalo\" is written. Amaia links the \"Tartalo\" message to the pile of bones that her team had found the year before. She finds that \"Tartalo\" refers to an old pagan legend told by the Spanish Inquisition where a giant eats Christian babies to stop them from growing up religious. In the meantime, Amaia and her family move to Elizondo after her Aunt Engrasi mentions the abandoned house that her grandmother left behind. Amaia meets the groundskeeper, but finds it odd when he does not greet her back after waving at him. Engrasi mentions that he does not speak much and is estranged from his son. Amaia video calls her former mentor and FBI agent Aloisius Dupree, asking for help; at the same time Aunt Engrasi uses tarot cards to predict what could happen, warning Amaia to be careful because there's evil around her. Judge Javier Markina follows the investigation with great attention. Amaia's constant calls to work cause a rift in her relationship with James, despite him moving to Elizondo in hopes of growing the family. However, the case makes a dramatic twist by double-entry: the baby with an amputated arm shares Amaia's DNA and is revealed to be Amaia's twin sister she never knew existed. Amaia dreams of her child self and her twin sister in the woods and we see a flashback to when Rosario attempts to kill her twin babies, it is only when Amaia's father intervenes that Amaia is saved, but it is too late for the other twin. Amaia finds the courage to visit her mother to confront her about this attack but is instead called in after it is reported that Rosario attacked a nurse with a scalpel. A blood-written message of \"Tartalo\" is found under the bed, causing the reappearance of the enigmatic psychiatrist Padre Saralosa who, interested in Rosario, tries to convince Amaia to move Rosario to Saralosa's university hospital in which he is the director. Forced to look into her family's past, Amaia discovers the relation between her mother and a sect dedicated to a pagan cult that included human sacrifices, and that all the crimes are connected to her. Amaia asks for the psychiatric interviews, which were all filmed, between the doctor and her mother. She discovers that the doctor is in fact the groundskeeper's estranged son, who is involved in the pagan acts. She also then realizes that her mother intends to kill her son, Ibai. She immediately calls Rosaura to save Ibai but Elizondo is flooded and Rosaura arrives too late to save him, finding an unconscious Engrasi and Ibai gone. Jonan and Amaia drive on and find Rosario and Doctor Berasategui ready to sacrifice the baby. Amaia shoots to stop the sacrifice. Rosario then realises that Amaia’s child is a boy and not a girl as intended. She tells Amaia that although she was successful in sacrificing her sister, she is not done with Amaia. She then disappears. Amaia puts her twin sister's bones to rest in the backyard of the large house, but her mother is still at large.",

    "title": "The Imitation Game",
    "plot": "In 1951, police investigate the mathematician Alan Turing after an apparent home break-in. During his interrogation, Turing talks of his work at Bletchley Park during WWII. In 1928, the young Turing is constantly bullied at boarding school. Developing a friendship with Christopher Morcom, who sparks his interest in cryptography, he soon develops romantic feelings. However, Christopher shortly dies from tuberculosis. When Britain declares war on Germany in 1939, Turing joins the cryptography team of Hugh Alexander, John Cairncross, Peter Hilton, Keith Furman, and Charles Richards in Bletchley Park, directed by Commander Alastair Denniston. They are to analyze the Enigma machine, which the Nazis use to send coded messages. Difficult to work with, and believing his colleagues to be inferior, Turing works alone to design a machine to decipher Enigma messages. When Denniston refuses to fund the machine's £100,000 construction cost, Turing contacts Prime Minister Winston Churchill who appoints him as team leader and provides necessary funds. Turing then fires Furman and Richards and places a difficult crossword in newspapers as a test to find replacements. Cambridge graduate Joan Clarke passes Turing's test but her family will not allow her to work with the male cryptographers. Turing arranges for her to live and work with the women who intercept the messages, and shares his plans with her. Clarke helps Turing warm to the others, who begin to respect him. Turing's machine, which he names Christopher, is constructed but cannot determine the Enigma encryption settings quickly enough; as the Germans reset them each day. Denniston orders it to be destroyed and Turing fired, but the other cryptographers threaten to leave if Turing goes. When Clarke plans to leave because of her parents, Turing proposes, which she accepts. During their engagement party, Turing confirms his homosexuality to Cairncross, who advises him to keep it a secret. Overhearing a clerk talking about messages she receives from the same German coder, Turing has an epiphany: he can program the machine to decode words he already knows exist in certain messages. A German coder always opening his first message with a standard plaintext German script reveals enough of the day's Enigma code for Christopher to quickly decode all the day's messages. Recalibrating the machine, it quickly decodes a message, and the cryptographers celebrate. Discovering a convoy is about to be attacked, Turing realizes that if they suddenly react to prevent it the Germans will know Enigma is compromised and change it. Therefore, the team cannot act on every decoded message, so they do not act to save the convoy although Peter begs them, as his brother is part of it. Turing creates a statistical model to choose the warnings to send to maximize destruction and minimize detection. Discovering Cairncross is a Soviet spy, Turing confronts him. He argues that the Soviets are allies, working for the same goals, and threatens to retaliate by disclosing Turing's sexuality. When the top MI6 agent Stewart Menzies appears to threaten Clarke, Turing reveals that Cairncross is a spy. Menzies reveals in turn that he already knew, and has been using Cairncross to leak misinformation to the Soviets for British benefit. Turing urges Clarke to leave Bletchley Park, telling her he is a homosexual. She tells him that she always suspected but insists they would have been happy together anyway. Fearing for her safety, Turing says he never cared for her, and only used her for her cryptography skills. Although heartbroken, Clarke stays on, knowing how important it is. She refuses to bow down to what Turing or her parents want her to do, or what they think of her decisions. After the war, Menzies has the cryptographers destroy the evidence, as MI6 wants governments to believe they have unbreakable code machines. The team should never meet again or share what they have done. In 1952, Turing is convicted of gross indecency and undergoes chemical castration instead of prison, so he can continue his work. Clarke visits him, witnesses his physical and mental deterioration, and tries to comfort him. The epilogue shows Turing died by suicide on June 7, 1954, after a year of government-mandated hormonal therapy. In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II granted him a posthumous Royal Pardon. Historians estimate that breaking Enigma shortened the war by over 2 years, saving over 14 million lives; and Turing's work was an important step towards today's computers.",

    "plot": "After Washington, D.C., detective, forensic psychologist, and author Dr. Alex Cross loses control of a sting operation resulting in his partner Tracie Fisher's death, he retires from the police force. His departure is short-lived when Megan Rose, the daughter of a prominent US senator, is kidnapped from her private school by a man named Gary Soneji, who is disguised as her new computer science teacher. US Secret Service Special Agent Jezzie Flannigan is held responsible for the breach in security that allowed Soneji to take the girl. In response, Cross and Flannigan join forces to track down Soneji and find Megan. After Cross receives a phone call from Soneji, he finds a small sneaker belonging to Megan in his mailbox. Cross realizes that Soneji is trying to emulate the 1932 Charles A. Lindbergh Jr. kidnapping, a crime so infamous that it became known as the Crime of the Century. With the knowledge that Soneji is trying to make a name for himself in the same way as Richard Hauptmann, Cross is even more determined to bring Soneji to justice and get Megan back safely, which he posits is a storyline worthy of one of his true crime books. Despite Soneji's now-public identity, the FBI is unable to capture him until Cross secretly tracks his calls and locations. Unbeknownst to Cross and Flannigan, Soneji's abduction of Megan is only a small part of his elaborate plan to secure greater fame. His coordinated kidnap plot is revealed to center around the son of the President of Russia, Dimitri Starodubov. Soneji attempts to capture the young boy despite the protection provided by police and security guards. However, before he is able to kidnap Starodubov, Cross and Flannigan confront Soneji and rescue the boy. In desperation, Soneji sends Cross a ransom demand asking for $10 million in diamonds from the president. If Cross fails to comply, Soneji will have no further reason to reach an agreement, and Megan will be killed. Knowing there is no other recourse, Cross complies and follows a set of directions to a number of public phone-booths spread out throughout the city where he will make deliveries and collect further instructions. Cross eventually delivers the diamonds by throwing them off a moving train to a man in black. Soneji arrives at Flannigan's home in order to kidnap her and use her as ransom. However, after arriving and disabling Flannigan with a taser, Soneji finds Cross present and challenges him about the ransom. Cross comments on Soneji receiving $12 million in ransom, to which Soneji does not react. He realises that Soneji is unaware of the ransom, and when Soneji attempts to escape, Cross shoots him dead. Upon further investigation, Cross realises that Flannigan had known about Soneji for some time and had used him as a pawn in her own plot to collect a ransom from Megan's family. She and fellow agent Ben Devine had crafted a plan to do just that and had been slowly gathering Soneji's information to use when the time was right. Cross realizes that Flannigan has been playing them all along. This culminates in Cross accessing Flannigan's personal computer, which contains all the details of the Soneji plot leading up to the kidnapping of Megan, the attempted kidnapping of Dmitri, including his information, timelines, and plans. Cross tracks Flannigan down to a secluded farmhouse. Flannigan has brutally murdered Devine, and she is now intent on killing Megan. Cross gets the better of Flannigan and arrives in time to prevent another tragedy. He takes aim and, with a single shot, stops Flannigan from pursuing Megan before happily agreeing to return the girl to her parents.",

    "plot": "One night, a security guard catches petty thief Louis \"Lou\" Bloom stealing from a Los Angeles railyard. Lou attacks the guard, swipes his watch, and takes manhole covers, fencing, and other materials. While trying to sell the stolen materials at a scrap yard, Lou asks the foreman for a job. Aware the police are looking for the manhole covers, the foreman tells Lou he will not hire a thief. While driving home in his beat-up Toyota Tercel, Lou spots a car crash and pulls over. Stringers—freelance photojournalists—arrive and record the burning wreckage and police response. One stringer, Joe Loder, explains to Lou how they sell their film footage to local news stations. Inspired, Lou steals an expensive bicycle and pawns it for a camcorder and a police radio scanner. After two unsuccessful attempts at recording incidents, Lou records the aftermath of a fatal carjacking and sells the footage to KWLA 6. The morning news director, Nina Romina, says the station is especially interested in \"graphic\" footage of accidents and violent crime in affluent, predominantly white areas. Lou hires Rick, a young homeless man desperate for money, as his assistant. To create more dramatic film footage, Lou tampers with crime scenes, in one case moving a body for a better camera angle. As Lou's work gains traction, he buys better equipment and a faster car (a red Dodge Challenger). Lou proves to be a smart quick learner. Knowing Nina's two-year contract is nearly up and she needs higher ratings to keep her job, he threatens to sell film footage to other stations unless she agrees to a sexual relationship. It is implied that she acquiesces. Lou declines Joe's offer to work for him, but when Joe beats him to an important plane crash story, Nina demands that Lou get better footage to keep their bargain. Lou sabotages Joe's van; when it crashes, Joe is severely injured and Lou records the aftermath. Later, Lou and Rick arrive before the police at the site of a triple-homicide home invasion in Granada Hills. Lou films the gunmen leaving in their Cadillac Escalade and also the victims in the house. He presents the footage to the station after editing out the perpetrators. The news staff frets over the ethics of using the footage but Nina is eager to break the story. In exchange, Lou demands public credit and more money. Police detective Frontieri arrives at Lou's apartment to question his connection to the home invasion. Lou gives her edited footage of the incident, deleting portions with the gunmen. That night, Lou and Rick track down one gunman to his house, staking it out until he leaves to pick up his partner. Lou wants to follow them to a crowded public area, then call the police and record the ensuing confrontation. Alarmed, Rick demands half the reward money for locating the gunmen, threatening to tell the police about Lou withholding evidence. After some back-and-forth, Lou agrees. When the gunmen stop at a restaurant, Lou phones the police, warning them the suspects are armed. They arrive and exchange gunfire. A police officer is shot and one killer is gunned down while the other escapes in the Escalade. The police give chase. Lou and Rick follow close behind, filming the pursuit as it happens, culminating in a long multiple-car collision. After the gunman's car crashes, Lou approaches the vehicle, claiming that the gunman is dead and urging Rick to film him. The gunman is alive, however, and shoots Rick. He flees but is killed by arriving police officers. As Rick lies dying, he accuses Lou of knowing the gunman was still alive. Lou, filming Rick, says he cannot work with someone who successfully extorted him for withholding evidence because it would happen again. Nina is awed by the chase footage and expresses her devotion to Lou. The news team discovers that the home invasion was actually the criminals breaking in to steal the homeowner's cocaine stash; Nina refuses to report this information to maximize the story's dramatic impact. Police try to confiscate Lou's footage as evidence, but Nina defends her legal right to withhold it and immediately airs it. Lou voluntarily speaks with Detective Frontieri. While being interrogated, Lou fabricates a story about the men in the Escalade following him; Frontieri suspects he is lying but is unable to prove it. Later, Lou hires a team of interns to expand his film business, saying that he will not ask them to do anything he is unwilling to do himself.",

While overseeing security at a concert for pop star Sheerah, Bryan saves her from a knife-wielding attacker. Sheerah gratefully offers to have her vocal coach assess Kim, an aspiring singer. Meanwhile, Kim needs Bryan's written permission to visit Paris with her friend, Amanda. Though concerned about Kim's safety, Bryan, pressured by Lenore, reluctantly agrees. At the airport, Bryan learns that Kim and Amanda are actually planning to follow U2 during their European tour. Upon arriving at Charles de Gaulle Airport, Kim and Amanda meet Peter, who offers to share a taxi. Kim and Amanda arrive at her cousins' apartment, where Kim unexpectedly finds that they are vacationing in Spain. While talking with Bryan on her cell phone, Kim sees men entering the apartment and abducting Amanda. Upon instructions from her father, Kim yells out her captor's descriptions as she is taken. Bryan tells the kidnappers that he will avoid pursuing them if they release Kim, but threatens them with death if they fail to comply. The listener only replies, \"good luck,\" and terminates the call. Bryan's former colleague, Sam, deduces the kidnappers belong to an Albanian sex trafficking ring and identifies the recorded voice as mob boss, Marko Hoxha. Based on previous abductions, Kim must be found within 96 hours or be lost forever. Bryan flies to Paris. At the apartment, he finds Kim's phone and checks the photos, identifying Peter in a reflection. Bryan locates and apprehends Peter at the airport attempting to lure another young victim, but Peter breaks free after one of his associates attacks Bryan. In the ensuing pursuit, Peter inadvertently walks into oncoming traffic and is killed by an oncoming truck. With his only lead dead, Bryan contacts Jean-Claude Pitrel, an ex-DGSE agent turned National Police officer. Jean-Claude informs him about the local red-light district where the Albanians operate but warns Bryan to avoid getting involved. Bryan plants a listening device on an Albanian pimp, and with help from a hired translator, is led to a makeshift brothel in a construction yard. He rescues a drugged young woman who has Kim's denim jacket, causing a violent gunfight that kills several sex traffickers. Bryan takes the woman to a hotel and improvises her detoxification. The next morning, the woman informs Bryan about a safehouse where she and Kim were kept. Posing as Jean-Claude, Bryan infiltrates under the pretence of renegotiating the police protection rate. When Bryan identifies Marko by his voice, the meeting erupts into a fight, which results in several thugs being killed. Searching the house, Bryan finds Amanda, who died from overdose. Bryan tortures Marko with electricity and leaves him to die from continuous electrocution, but not before the latter reveals that virgins like Kim are sold on the black market, identifying the buyer as crime syndicate terrorist, Patrice Saint-Clair. After a vicious confrontation with Jean-Claude over his corruption in order to disclose Saint-Clair's location, Bryan infiltrates a clandestine sex slave auction occurring beneath Saint-Clair's mansion. Witnessing Kim as the last sale, Bryan forces an Arab bidder to purchase her but is subsequently caught and subdued. Saint-Clair orders him killed, but Bryan breaks loose and eliminates all the henchmen; a mortally wounded Saint-Clair reveals Kim was delivered to a nearby yacht before Bryan murders him. Boarding the vessel, Bryan eliminates the bodyguards and breaks into a bedroom where a Sheikh is holding Kim at knifepoint. He kills the sheikh and saves Kim.

    "plot": "In 1980, hitman Anton Chigurh is arrested in Texas. He escapes by strangling the sheriff's deputy and steals a car by killing the driver with a captive bolt pistol. Later, he spares the life of a gas station owner for correctly calling a coin toss. Meanwhile, Llewelyn Moss is hunting pronghorns in the desert. He comes across the aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong, finding several dead men, a wounded Mexican man begging for water, drugs in a truck, and a briefcase containing $2 million in cash. He takes the briefcase and returns home. Feeling guilty, he returns with water that night but finds the man has been murdered. He looks up to the ridge and sees two men with guns who pursue him in a truck. He escapes by diving into a river. After making his way back home, Moss sends his wife, Carla Jean, to stay with her mother. Chigurh is hired to recover the missing money; meanwhile, Terrell County Sheriff Ed Tom Bell begins investigating the failed drug deal. Chigurh searches Moss' trailer home, using his bolt pistol to blow out the door lock. Moss takes a taxi to a motel in Del Rio, where he hides the briefcase in his room's air duct. After Moss returns to the motel after purchasing new boots, he sees the curtains in his room in a different position from when he left, and rightly assumes he has been found. Following a tracking device hidden in the case, Chigurh goes to Moss' motel and kills three Mexican mobsters who were waiting for Moss in his room. Moss has rented a second room adjacent to his first room with access to the duct where the money is hidden. He retrieves the briefcase before Chigurh opens the duct. Moving to a hotel in the border town of Eagle Pass, Moss discovers the tracking device, but Chigurh has already found him. Their firefight spills onto the streets, badly wounding both and killing a truck driver. Moss flees to Mexico, hiding the case along the Rio Grande. Chigurh cleans and stitches his wounds with stolen supplies. Carson Wells, a bounty hunter, visits a wounded Moss in a Mexican hospital, and offers protection from Chigurh in exchange for the money, but Moss refuses. Chigurh ambushes Wells at his hotel. The phone rings as Wells is bartering for his life. Chigurh shoots him and takes the call from Moss, vowing to kill Carla Jean unless Moss gives up the money. Moss retrieves the case from the Rio Grande and arranges to meet Carla Jean at a motel in El Paso, where he plans to give her the money and hide her from danger. Carla Jean's mother unknowingly reveals Moss' location to a group of Mexicans tailing them. Bell reaches the motel in El Paso, only to find that the Mexicans have killed Moss. Carla Jean arrives later and weeps when Bell somberly removes his hat. Bell visits his cousin Ellis and tells him he plans to retire because he feels overmatched by the recent violence. Ellis tells Bell that he cannot evade fate, and only vanity makes him think otherwise. That night, Bell returns to the crime scene and sees the lock blown out. Chigurh appears to be on the other side of the door holding his shotgun. Bell hesitantly enters and finds the room empty, and notices that the room's air duct has been opened. Carla Jean returns from her mother's funeral to find Chigurh waiting in her bedroom. Chigurh says he must fulfill his vow, but offers a coin toss as a compromise. Carla Jean refuses to call it, saying that he will be responsible for her fate. Chigurh checks the soles of his boots as he leaves the house. As he drives through the neighborhood, another car crashes into him, breaking his arm. He pays a passing boy for the shirt off his back to use as a sling, and limps away. Now retired, Bell shares two dreams with his wife. In the first, he lost some money his father had given him. In the other, as he rode horseback through a snowy mountain pass, his father rode past him carrying fire in a horn, and he knew his father would prepare a campfire ahead for both of them.",

    "plot": "Four magicians—J. Daniel Atlas, an illusionist, Merritt McKinney, a mentalist, Henley Reeves, an escape artist, and Jack Wilder, a card shark and pickpocket—each receive a tarot card summoning them to a New York City apartment, where they discover holographic instructions from an unknown benefactor. One year later, they perform in Las Vegas as \"The Four Horsemen,\" sponsored by insurance magnate Arthur Tressler. Their act culminates in a trick that appears to transport an audience member into a Paris bank vault, dispersing stolen euros over the crowd. When the bank is found empty, the FBI and Interpol arrest the Horsemen, but they release them due to lack of evidence. FBI agent Dylan Rhodes and Interpol detective Alma Dray consult with Thaddeus Bradley, a former magician-turned-debunker who is notorious among magicians for having destroyed their careers. Thaddeus deduces and explains to Dylan and Alma that the Horsemen used a mock vault, hypnotized the participant beforehand, and used flash paper disguised as cash, which burned when the vents were activated, leaving no smoke or residue. With Bradley's help, their investigation follows the Horsemen to New Orleans, where they publicly transfer funds from Tressler’s accounts to audience members who were denied insurance after Hurricane Katrina. Dylan tries to capture them but fails after Daniel drops his tracker in Dylan's pocket. Angered by his loss of money, Tressler hires Bradley to expose the Four Horsemen. Alma suspects the group is linked to \"the Eye,\" a mythical secret society of magicians who aid the oppressed, suspecting that a third party is helping them. The Horsemen continue to evade capture, even swapping Dylan’s phone with a bugged replica to stay ahead. In New York, three of the Horsemen escape from an FBI raid, but Jack appears to die in a car crash after being chased by Dylan and Alma. Before Jack dies as his car explodes, Dylan finds documents in his hand pointing to their next target: Elkhorn Security. The FBI intercepts a safe being transported under suspicious orders, but it contains only balloon animals. The Horsemen announce that their final show is going to take place in public at 5 Pointz. Dylan, Alma, and the team rush to 5 Pointz, but they are unable to capture the three Horsemen. The show ends with their disappearance amid a flurry of counterfeit money. The actual stolen funds are discovered in Bradley’s car, leading to his arrest. In jail, Bradley meets with Dylan, deducing that not only had Jack faked his death in the car crash, but the Horsemen must’ve had someone on the inside to succeed in their heists. Dylan reveals that he is the real orchestrator of the Horsemen’s heists and leaves Bradley in prison wondering why he did it. At Central Park, the Three Horsemen meet with Jack and Dylan, where Dylan formally inducts the Horsemen into the Eye. Dylan later meets Alma in Paris and confirms his role, revealing that the heists were revenge against those responsible for the death of his father, Lionel Shrike. Lionel was once a beloved magician whose career was destroyed by Bradley, so he had attempted a dangerous escape act which failed due to a faulty Elkhorn safe that led to his drowning, and his life insurance was denied by Tressler. Alma, sympathetic to his motives, agrees to protect his secret.",

    "plot": "Melinda and Vic Van Allen live with their young daughter Trixie in Little Wesley, Louisiana. Vic has retired early after developing guidance chips for combat drones, and his complicated relationship with Melinda is held together by a precarious arrangement: they sleep apart and Melinda takes lovers openly, even in their family home, while Vic finds solace in raising his large collection of snails. Their open marriage is no secret to their concerned friends, and Vic grows increasingly jealous, while Melinda laments his lack of passion. Melinda invites her latest lover, Joel, to a neighbour's party. Alone with Joel, Vic tells him that he murdered Melinda's previous lover Martin, who has recently disappeared. The story spreads through their circle of friends, raising the suspicions of noir writer Don Wilson. Joel comes to dinner with the Van Allen family, and Vic elaborates in private that he killed Martin with a hammer, frightening Joel into leaving town. A TV news report reveals that Martin's body has been found shot to death, and a suspect is arrested. Vic confronts Melinda after she gives money to Charlie, her new lover and piano teacher. She invites Charlie to a friend's pool party and introduces him to Vic, toying with his jealousy. Rain sends everyone inside, leaving Vic and Charlie alone in the water. After Melinda discovers Charlie's body drowned in the pool, the party is questioned by police, and Melinda is quick to accuse Vic of murdering Charlie. He later asks if she is scared of him, and she says she is not as \"I'm the one you killed for\". Don's wife Kelly tells Vic that her husband and Melinda have been accusing him of Charlie's murder. Vic discovers they have hired a private investigator to follow him and confronts Don in front of Don's family. Melinda reconnects with an old boyfriend, Tony, and Vic overhears their conversation suggesting they will move to Brazil, taking Trixie with them. She invites Tony to dinner with Vic and takes him to her bedroom, furthering Vic's jealousy. Vic lures Tony into his car and drives him to a secluded spot he and Melinda share, overlooking a rocky gorge. He throws stones at Tony, causing him to fall down the hill to his death, and sinks his body in the creek. Melinda takes Vic and their daughter on a picnic to the same spot. Vic gives her a collection of photographs he has surreptitiously taken of her as a testament to his love, but spots Tony's body resurfaced in the creek. Returning home, he offers to go back to the spot in the morning to retrieve Melinda's lost scarf. She notifies Don, but invites Vic to share her bed that night. The next day, Vic bikes to the creek to deal with Tony's body, but is caught in the act by Don. Don rushes away in his car to notify authorities. Vic pursues him on his bike and takes a shortcut through the brush to try to head Don off. Vic tumbles out of the bushes and falls off his bike into the car's path; texting recklessly, Don swerves to avoid Vic but drives off a cliff and is killed. At home, Melinda finds Tony's wallet in one of Vic's snail vivaria. She packs a suitcase to leave, which Trixie throws in the pool, insisting they stay. Vic arrives home, where Melinda tells him that she \"saw Tony\". However, she then burns Tony's wallet and ID cards.",

    "plot": "After a man's car is hit by a stranger, the stranger kills him as he takes pictures of the damage to submit to his car insurance. Jung Tae-suk is a cop who goes through the crime scene and suspects it to be the work of a serial killer, but his commanding officer does not believe him. Jang Dong-soo is a crime boss who, while on his way home after a meeting, is hit by the same killer, who tries to kill him as well. A brutal fight ensues, leaving both of them injured. Finally, the killer escapes after hitting Dong-soo with his car. Dong-soo is admitted to the hospital, and his henchmen assume that the attack was committed by a rival gang, whom they counter-attack. However, Dong-soo believes the killer was not a rival gang member as his moves seemed to be random and purposeless. Tae-suk visits Dong-soo at the hospital and asks him to cooperate so that the police can catch the killer for him, but Dong-soo refuses. Instead, Dong-soo orders his men to find the killer. Using a sketch and Dong-soo's memory of the killer's license plate, they manage to find his car and a knife. Dong-soo eventually informs Tae-suk of the findings, and they decide to team up to catch the mysterious killer. Dong-soo agrees to provide manpower and cover expenses — but on the condition that the killer belongs to the one who finds him first. Dong-soo wants to kill him for revenge while Tae-suk wants to arrest him in order to solve five connected murder cases and eventually get promoted. Meanwhile, Dong-soo orders his right-hand man, Kwon Oh-sung, to kill his rival Heo Sang-do with the killer's knife that already has traces of blood from the killer's previous victims. An enraged Tae-suk gets into a fight with Dong-soo upon learning what he has done as the killing is confirmed to be the work of a serial killer, causing the case to be transferred to the major case squad. Dong-soo attends Sang-do's funeral; the killer also turns up and informs Sang-do's second-in-command that Sang-do was killed with the killer's knife, but by someone else. When Tae-suk and Dong-soo check the killer's car for any evidence, they are attacked by Sang-do's henchmen. A fight ensues, resulting in the death of Sang-do's right-hand man while in a fight with Tae-suk. Dong-soo gets him buried and clears the scene. Tae-suk gets assigned to investigate a kidnapping case and, while solving it, spots the killer. A chase ensues, but the killer is able to escape. Through forensic test, Tae-suk discovers the killer to be a missing person. He informs Dong-soo about this and lets him hear a voice clip to confirm the missing person is the killer. Later, Dong-soo helps a high school girl by giving her his umbrella but soon learns that the girl has been murdered and his umbrella was found at the crime scene. Dong-soo and Tae-suk and their men start looking for the killer in the area where the girl was murdered and eventually find him in a car. In the ensuing chase, the killer manages to kill Oh-sung but is finally captured and incapacitated by Dong-soo. Dong-soo takes the killer away to torture and kill him, but Tae-suk tracks them down and crashes his car into the hideout just as Dong-soo is about to kill the killer. Tae-suk hits Dong-soo with his car and arrests the killer. The police have no conclusive evidence against the killer, Kang Kyung-ho. As a last resort, Tae-suk asks Dong-soo, the sole survivor of the attacks, to testify. Simultaneously, Tae-suk threatens to release a tape of Dong-soo's confession of having Sang-do killed. During Kyung-ho's trial, Dong-soo arrives to testify and provides decisive testimony. Dong-soo successfully predicts the existence of a stab wound on Kyung-ho's body, previously inflicted by Dong-soo during their first encounter. Dong-soo also provides misleading evidence framing Kyung-ho for Sang-do's murder. The court sentences Kyung-ho to death; however, Dong-soo is also arrested due to his illegal activities. Tae-suk is finally promoted while Dong-soo is sent to the prison where Kyung-ho is kept: the condition which Dong-soo had requested Tae-suk to fulfill in exchange for the testimony followed by his arrest. Spotting Kyung-ho, Dong-soo gleefully enters prison. While Kyung-ho is showering, he is confronted by Dong-soo with a rope in his hand and a smile on his face.",

Although she declines, she later shows up at his apartment and tells him about her marital problems, but says she wants to make it work. Later, her husband, Stuart, tells Bryan never to see his wife again. The next morning, Bryan receives a text from Lenore asking to meet for breakfast. When Bryan returns home, he discovers Lenore dead. Two LAPD officers immediately appear to arrest him, but Bryan subdues them, leads other officers on a chase through the neighborhood, disappears into the sewer system, and escapes. Meanwhile, LAPD Detective Dotzler reviews Bryan's background. Bryan retreats to a safe house equipped with weapons and surveillance electronics. He retraces Lenore's final movements to a gas station and obtains the surveillance footage showing her being abducted by men with distinctive hand tattoos. LAPD detectives arrive to arrest him, but Bryan hijacks the police cruiser and downloads phone records from an LAPD database onto a thumb drive. He contacts Kim at Lenore's funeral via a camera hidden in his friend Sam's suit, and instructs her to maintain her \"very predictable schedule\". Bryan arranges to meet with her later and removes a surveillance bug, which Dotzler planted on her. Kim tells Bryan that she is pregnant, and that Stuart is acting scared and has hired bodyguards. Bryan chases Stuart's car, but a pursuing SUV ambushes him, forcing his car over a cliff. Bryan survives, hijacks another car, and follows the attacking terrorists to a roadside liquor store. Bryan kills the men, then abducts and interrogates Stuart using waterboarding. Stuart confesses that his former business partner and ex-Russian Spetsnaz operator, Oleg Malankov, a mob boss and terrorist leader, murdered Lenore because Stuart owes him money; Stuart exposed Bryan's identity to Malankov out of jealousy. With assistance from his old colleagues and a nervous Stuart, Bryan gains entry to Malankov's heavily secured penthouse. After Bryan kills Malankov's guards and fights Malankov, a mortally-wounded Malankov reveals that Stuart planned Lenore's murder and framed Bryan as part of a business deal to collect a $12,000,000 life insurance policy. Malankov adds that when Stuart failed to kill Bryan, he used Bryan to try to kill Malankov so Stuart could keep the insurance money. Meanwhile, Stuart abducts Kim, intending to flee with the money. Under police pursuit, Bryan arrives at the airport in Malankov's Porsche as Stuart's private plane is preparing for takeoff. After destroying the landing gear with the Porsche, Bryan overpowers Stuart. Heeding Kim's pleas, Bryan refrains from killing Stuart, but warns him to expect retribution if he escapes justice or receives a reduced prison sentence. Dotzler and the LAPD arrive and arrest Stuart while Bryan is cleared. In the aftermath, Kim tells Bryan she wants to name her child after her mother if it's a girl.",

    "plot": "A professional hitman known only as the Killer stakes out a Parisian hotel room. He prepares to use a sniper rifle to kill a target who will check into the hotel room at an unknown time. While waiting for the target, he eats, practices yoga, listens to music (exclusively the Smiths), and talks on the phone with his handler, Eddie Hodges, who is an attorney and his former university law professor. The target arrives with a dominatrix and the Killer shoots but misses, accidentally shooting the dominatrix. The Killer flees, evading the police and disposing of his equipment. He then flies to the United States. The Killer returns to his hideout in the Dominican Republic to find it has been broken into and his girlfriend Magdala attacked. She is in the ICU of a hospital, with her brother Marcus watching over her. Marcus says that Magdala was interrogated and tortured by two assassins but managed to injure one of them and escape. The Killer tracks down Leo, the taxi driver who drove the assassins to the Killer's home. Leo identifies one of the assassins, a strong man with a limp leg, nicknamed \"The Brute\", and a woman who resembles a Q-Tip, known as \"The Expert\". The Killer shoots Leo dead and seeks to track down the assassins. The Killer travels to Hodges' office in New Orleans and enters the building disguised as a maintenance person. After forcing Dolores, Hodges' secretary, to restrain her boss and herself, the Killer destroys their electronics. As Hodges attempts to get the Killer to leave, the Killer shoots him in the chest with a nail gun to torture the names of the hitmen out of him. However, Hodges doesn't reveal the information and dies more quickly than the Killer anticipated. Dolores offers to show the Killer the assassins' identities in her paper files in her home, asking in return that the Killer give her a non-suspicious death so her children can claim a life insurance payout. After receiving the names at her home, the Killer breaks his rule not to show empathy; he snaps her neck and shoves her down a flight of stairs, making her death look like an accident, as she had requested. He then disposes of Hodges' body. The Killer drives to St. Petersburg, Florida, where he confronts the Brute, whom he identifies by his limp. At night, he breaks into The Brute's home to kill him, but he is blindsided and tackled. A fight ensues, during which the Brute realizes who the Killer is before the Killer fatally shoots him and sets his house on fire with a Molotov cocktail. The Killer then travels to Beacon, New York, and confronts the Expert at a gourmet restaurant. Appearing to accept her fate, the Expert offers to share with him a \"last supper\" of whiskey, during which she questions the Killer's motivations. They leave the restaurant and go to a park. After The Expert appears to slip down a small flight of ice-covered stairs, she asks the Killer to help her up, but the Killer shoots her dead, revealing that she was concealing a knife. The Killer travels to Chicago, to kill billionaire venture capitalist Henderson \"Clay\" Claybourne, reflecting during his flight that police take more interest in the deaths of rich people. He uses tools bought on Amazon to enter Claybourne's penthouse. Confronting him, the Killer remains mostly silent. Claybourne says that he has no personal problem with the Killer and, as a first-time client of a hitman, agreed to pay Hodges for \"the trail to be scrubbed\", not knowing what that meant. The Killer spares Claybourne, but he promises him a slow death if Claybourne ever targets him again. The Killer returns to the Dominican Republic and sits next to a recovering Magdala.",

    "plot": "MI6 operative James Bond is promoted to 00 agent status; his first assignment is to assassinate the traitorous MI6 section chief Dryden and his contact in Prague. In Uganda, Mr. White introduces Steven Obanno, a commander of the Lord's Resistance Army, to Le Chiffre, an Albanian private banker to terrorists. Obanno entrusts Le Chiffre with $100 million to invest. Using knowledge of his upcoming terrorist attack on aerospace manufacturer Skyfleet, Le Chiffre shorts the company's stock. In Madagascar, Bond destroys an embassy while capturing and then killing a bomb maker named Mollaka. MI6 chief M criticises Bond for causing an international incident and ignoring her orders to take Mollaka alive. Information on Mollaka's phone leads Bond to the Bahamas and corrupt Greek official Alex Dimitrios, who had hired Mollaka to bomb Skyfleet's prototype airliner at Le Chiffre's request. After winning Dimitrios's vintage Aston Martin in a poker game and seducing his wife Solange, Bond pursues Dimitrios to Miami. Bond fights off an attack by Dimitrios and kills him. At the airport, Bond chases down the new bomber Dimitrios has hired and prevents the destruction of the Skyfleet airliner. With the Skyfleet stock secure, Le Chiffre loses Obanno's money. Realising that somebody leaked the terrorist plot, Le Chiffre tortures Solange to death. To recoup his clients' money, Le Chiffre organizes a Texas hold 'em tournament at the Casino Royale in Montenegro. MI6 enters Bond—the agency's best poker player—in the tournament, believing a defeat will force Le Chiffre to seek asylum with the British government in exchange for information on his clients. Bond is paired with Vesper Lynd, a British Treasury agent overseeing the $10 million buy-in. They meet their contact, French secret service agent René Mathis, in Montenegro. Obanno, furious that his money was lost, threatens Le Chiffre, but allows him to continue playing to win back the money. Obanno and his bodyguard attack Bond, who kills them both. Bond loses his $10 million stake after Le Chiffre is tipped off about his own tell. Vesper refuses to authorize an additional $5 million for Bond to continue, but fellow player and CIA agent Felix Leiter stakes Bond the money in exchange for letting the CIA arrest Le Chiffre. Le Chiffre's lover, Valenka, poisons Bond's drink but Vesper rescues him. Bond returns to the game and wins the tournament. Le Chiffre kidnaps Vesper to trap Bond and takes them to an abandoned ship. He tortures Bond to reveal the password to the bank account holding his winnings, but Bond resists. Mr. White bursts in and kills Le Chiffre, but spares Bond and Vesper. Bond awakens in hospital and recovers with Vesper at his side. He has Mathis arrested, believing that he had tipped off Le Chiffre. Bond falls in love with Vesper and resigns from MI6, and the couple sail to Venice. When M reveals that his winnings were never transferred to the British treasury, Bond realizes that Vesper has betrayed him. He tracks her to an exchange of the money, where gunmen spot him and take her captive inside a gutted Venetian palace undergoing restoration and supported by large flotation devices. Bond destroys the flotation devices, causing the palace to lurch and sink into the Grand Canal, and kills the shooters. Vesper is trapped in the antique elevator cage as it submerges. Bond dives into the canal to rescue her, but she locks herself in to prevent him. Bond later attempts to resuscitate her, but fails, and Mr. White escapes with the money. M informs Bond, who has returned to service, that the organization behind Le Chiffre threatened to kill Vesper's lover unless she became a double agent. When Bond denounces Vesper as a traitor, M reasons that she likely made a deal with White by trading the winnings for Bond's life. Realizing Vesper left her phone to help him, Bond checks the contacts and locates Mr. White at an estate in Lake Como. He shoots White in the leg to disable him and introduces himself: \"The name's Bond, James Bond\".",

He is rammed by police officers Evan Marston and Steve Lann, who seize his $36,000 in cash via civil forfeiture. When courthouse clerk Elliot refuses to help, fellow employee Summer McBride promises to prepare the paperwork in case Terry can pay Mike's $10,000 bail before his Thursday transfer to state prison, where he would be in danger for informing on a gangster. Terry calls his former business partner Liu, who agrees to provide the money. At the police station, Terry tries to report the cash as stolen to Officer Jessica Sims, and is confronted by Lann and police chief Sandy Burnne. Terry offers to drop the matter if they give him back $10,000 and Burnne agrees to resolve the issue on Monday. Meanwhile, Summer discovers dozens of cases with misdemeanor defendants like Mike being held in jail for exactly 90 days. On Monday, Terry arrives at the station but Burnne has arranged for the prison bus to leave early. He catches up on his bike and tells Mike to stay safe until he posts bail. Liu can no longer send money after police raided his restaurant at Burnne's request, and Terry returns to the station and is taunted by Burnne. A close quarters combat expert, he subdues Lann and Burnne, and forces Sims to hand over the bail money and help him escape. Posting bail with Summer's help, Terry is captured at the courthouse. Terry is taken to a hospital by Marston and Burnne, who explains that Mike was stabbed after arriving at prison, and offers the remaining $26,000, the truck he was going to buy, and to not pursue charges if he leaves town. Terry accepts, but Mike has died. Summer drives Terry to pick up the truck, and he declines to help her investigate the suspicious cases. That night, Summer is injected with drugs by police and calls Terry, who returns to help. At work, she is forced to take a urine test, jeopardizing her child custody. As Terry leaves town, Lann flags him down, throws a gun into his truck as a pretense to open fire, and wounds him in the shoulder. Terry escapes and regroups with Summer at Liu's restaurant, where Liu, a Chinese medic during the Korean War, patches him up. Summer and Terry interrogate Elliot and the town's judge, who reveal a coverup to avoid transparency measures imposed after a legal settlement nearly bankrupted the town. People are held on misdemeanors without access to public defenders to seek production of their police dashcam arrest footage, which expires after 90 days. Terry and Summer break into the courthouse basement and retrieve the dashcam SD cards as police arrive and start a fire. He escapes, but she is captured trying to destroy her urine sample. Terry and Lann arrange a swap: Summer for the cards at sunrise. While Lann and a police contingent wait at Rebel Ridge, Terry breaks into the police station using the truck and subdues Burnne. Terry recruits Sims, who he believes is Summer's informant in the police department codenamed Serpico, to assist him but she instead detains him as the cops return. Lann destroys the cards and reveals that he has injected Summer with drugs and she is at risk of overdosing. Marston protests, revealing himself to be 'Serpico' instead, and is shot in the femoral by Burnne, but Terry defeats the officers who approach him, including Lann. Marston tells Terry to activate a police cruiser siren, saving the previous three minutes of dashcam footage, and walks Terry through administering Narcan on Summer.

    "plot": "Five years after the events of the first film, Stephanie Smothers is a famous true crime vlogger and amateur detective and has written a book about her friendship with Emily Nelson and her subsequent imprisonment. At a signing event, she is confronted by Emily, who has been released on appeal. She is marrying her old friend Dante Versano, a wealthy Italian man from a family with connections to organized crime. She invites Stephanie to be her maid of honor, goading her into agreement with the promise of increased book sales and the threat of a potential lawsuit. After arriving in Capri along with Dante and Stephanie's agent Vicky, the two reunite with Emily's ex-husband Sean and son Nicky. Also at the wedding are Emily's mother Margaret and her aunt Linda, as well as Dante's mother Portia, who has a contentious relationship with Emily, accusing her of marrying into the family for money. At a lunch before the wedding, a bitter and intoxicated Sean has a heated confrontation with Dante. Later, Sean is murdered in his hotel room by an unknown assailant. Stephanie attends Emily's \"bachelorette party\", where she turns out to be the only guest, and the two reconnect. When Stephanie returns to the hotel, she discovers Sean's death, which the local police write off as an \"accident\". Suspecting Emily's involvement, Stephanie follows her the next day but is distracted by an American tourist who reveals herself as Irene Walker, an FBI agent investigating Linda, and shows Stephanie a photo of Linda talking to a mysterious woman that Stephanie identifies as Emily from her tattoo. They are interrupted by Dante, who Stephanie later sees in a heated discussion with Matteo Bartolo, a member of the Versanos' rival family. Emily and Dante are married. At the reception, Dante makes a show of burning the prenuptial agreement between him and Emily, declaring it as a gesture of peace between the Versanos and the Bartolos. Later that evening, Stephanie follows Dante as he leaves the reception, only to witness him being shot to death. Portia accuses Emily of murdering him, while Linda casts suspicion on Matteo, who vehemently denies it. With Emily's presence accounted for, and Stephanie being the only witness to the murder, she is branded the prime suspect and is placed under house arrest while the death is investigated. Stephanie meets with Emily, only to realize from her odd behavior that she is in fact Charity, the third of the set of triplets that included Emily and her late sister Faith. Charity stabs herself, framing Stephanie for the attack. Stephanie is freed from her captivity by Isabella, a housekeeper paid by Irene. Isabella lets her into Margaret's room; she reveals that Charity's stillbirth was faked by Linda, a con artist who raised her as her own. Stephanie leaves the hotel and meets Irene, but before she can be taken to a safehouse, Irene is fatally stabbed by Charity in disguise once again framing Stephanie for the murder. Meanwhile, Linda discovers from Margaret that Stephanie spoke with her, and smothers her with a pillow. Stephanie is taken to meet with Portia Versano. Portia injects Stephanie with sodium thiopental, believing that she and Emily conspired to kill Dante. After failing to get any clear answers from her, Portia orders her killed, but she is rescued by Emily. She explains that Linda attempted to blackmail her and Dante, threatening to reveal that their wedding was a marriage of convenience to hide that Dante and Matteo were lovers. After she refused, Emily was confronted by Charity, who killed both Sean and Dante due to her romantic obsession with Emily. Charity drugged her and married Dante in her place, with Emily only being freed after Charity forgot to drug her that day. Charity, posing as Emily, uses Stephanie's phone to livestream, sending a coded threat to Emily and Stephanie that she will kill Nicky if Stephanie does not turn herself in. Stephanie and Emily confront Charity and Linda, who is holding Nicky at gunpoint. Linda plans to kill Stephanie and pin the murders on her, with Charity assuming Emily's life, money, and position within the Versano family. Stephanie points out that Emily will also have to die, which Charity rejects. In the ensuing commotion, Nicky flies a toy drone into Linda's face, allowing Charity to take her gun and shoot her, sending her over a cliff to her death. Emily convinces her sister to take her place in prison, while also taking responsibility for all of the murders committed. Stephanie returns home, writing a second book about the murders in Capri and honoring Emily's wish that she gives Nicky a normal life. Emily, who has remained in hiding in Italy, is confronted by Portia. She reveals that she knew the marriage between Emily and Dante was a sham, and that Emily did not commit the murders. In return for welcoming Emily into the Versano family, she requests \"a simple favor\", handing her an envelope with unknown contents.",

    "plot": "In 2003, former Force Recon Marine and CIA SAD/SOG officer John Creasy travels to Mexico to visit his old friend Paul Rayburn, who convinces him to take a bodyguard position with Samuel Ramos, a wealthy automaker. He needs protection for his young daughter, Lupita \"Pita\" Ramos, due to a kidnapping insurance policy that requires a bodyguard to be in place. Struggling with alcoholism and guilt from his past, Creasy initially contemplates suicide, but a misfired gun prompts him to reconsider his fate. Revitalized by the thought that he is meant to live, he takes on his role as Pita's protector, reducing his drinking and finding solace in the Bible. As he bonds with the child, teaching her to swim, their relationship flourishes. However, one day, while waiting outside Pita's piano lesson, Creasy recognizes a car that has been following them. As two federal policemen block the street, he realizes Pita is about to be kidnapped. In the ensuing chaos, Creasy engages the attackers, killing four but sustaining serious injuries while Pita is abducted. As authorities investigate, Creasy becomes a suspect, but reporter Mariana Garcia Guerrero questions the narrative. AFI agent Miguel Manzano relocates him to a veterinary clinic to protect him from corrupt officials. The kidnappers, led by the unseen \"Voice\", demand a $10 million ransom, which Samuel complies with, aided by Police Lieutenant Victor Fuentes. However, when the ransom drop is ambushed and the Voice's nephew is killed, the Voice threatens the Ramos family, stating Pita will be lost forever as retribution. Manzano warns Creasy about the powerful \"brotherhood\" involved, comprising corrupt officials and criminals, and Creasy vows to kill everyone connected to the kidnapping. With Rayburn's help, Creasy assembles an arsenal and begins his violent quest for revenge. He brutally interrogates the getaway driver for information, leading him to confront several kidnappers and recover incriminating evidence. Guerrero discovers Fuentes's involvement in the brotherhood, prompting her and Manzano to assist Creasy in his mission. Creasy's rampage intensifies as he confronts Fuentes, learning that Samuel's lawyer, Jordan Kalfus, orchestrated the kidnapping to claim insurance money. Creasy arrives to confront Kalfus at his house but finds the lawyer's beheaded corpse floating in the pool. He then confronts Samuel about his involvement with the kidnapping and the ruse is revealed: Samuel and Kalfus agreed to orchestrate the kidnapping in order to pay off old debts belonging to the former's father. Both had expected Lupita to be safely returned by paying off the ransom with the remaining insurance money. However, the ambush by Fuentes caused the plan to collapse, with Samuel killing Kalfus in a rage. Despondent over this revelation, Creasy gives Samuel a gun and the bullet he once used in his suicide attempt. So, Samuel kills himself as Creasy leaves. Guerrero and Manzano trace the ransom money and uncover the Voice's identity. Creasy captures the Voice's brother and learns that the ringleader's real name is Daniel Sanchez. They arrange an exchange for Pita, and during the meeting, Creasy, injured but determined, reassures her of his love before she is sent to safety. As Creasy is taken away to the Voice, he dies of his injuries en route; later that day, Manzano executes the Voice during the latter's arrest.",

    "plot": "A Caltech seismologist, Dr. Lawrence Hayes, and his colleague Dr. Kim Park are at Hoover Dam to test a new earthquake prediction model when a previously unknown nearby fault ruptures and triggers a Mw 7.1 earthquake that collapses the dam. Park sacrifices himself to save a young girl and is swept away by the water. Hayes discovers that the entire San Andreas Fault is shifting and will soon cause a chain reaction of massive earthquakes that will potentially destroy cities along the fault line. He begins racing to warn the population along with his students Alexi and Phoebe, reporter Serena Johnson, and her cameraman Dylan. When a Mw 9.1 earthquake devastates Los Angeles, Ray Gaines, a chief rescue helicopter pilot of the Los Angeles Fire Department who is going through a divorce from his wife, Emma, finds himself rescuing her from a skyscraper in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, their daughter Blake has been visiting San Francisco with Emma's new boyfriend, Daniel Riddick, who is a renowned engineer and builder. She meets Ben Taylor, a British engineer seeking employment at Daniel's firm, and Ben's younger brother, Ollie. As Daniel and Blake begin to drive out of the building, a similar magnitude earthquake strikes the city. Rubble from the collapsing parking garage pins her in Daniel's car. Daniel leaves Blake to find help, but then panics and ultimately abandons her in an act of cowardice. Ben and Ollie rescue Blake, take her to Chinatown, and call her parents for help. Ray and Emma attempt to reach San Francisco in Ray's helicopter but it suffers a gearbox failure, which forces them to make an emergency landing at a shopping mall in Bakersfield. Amid chaos and looting, Ray steals a truck to continue the journey. The pair is waved down by an elderly couple whose car has broken down on the side of the road, stopping them from falling into the San Andreas Fault, which has torn a large fissure through the highway, creating a canyon that now extends into the far distance in both directions. Ray and Emma exchange the truck for a small airplane that the couple owns; as they fly toward San Francisco, they reminisce about their other daughter, Mallory, who drowned several years ago. As Blake, Ben, and Ollie attempt to reach Nob Hill to signal them after finding their previous meeting point at Coit Tower engulfed in flames, Ray and Emma parachute into AT&T Park just before a Mw 9.6 quake hits, which becomes the largest recorded earthquake in history. As the quake subsides, having destroyed much of the city, Ray and Emma commandeer a boat to reach the group, only to realize that a tsunami is approaching San Francisco Bay. Alongside a handful of other survivors in boats and small ships, they cross the wave before it crests, barely avoiding a container ship caught up in the tsunami wave. The ship crashes into the Golden Gate Bridge's center span, killing everyone on the bridge, including Daniel, who is crushed by a falling shipping container. The tsunami strikes the already ruined city, capsizing a cruise ship and killing thousands more. Blake, Ben, and Ollie enter the Gate, a building whose construction Daniel had been overseeing, but they are still caught by the tsunami. As the building begins to collapse, trapping Blake underwater, Ray dives in, rescues her, and performs CPR. Emma crashes the boat through a window and drives the five of them out of the collapsing building as Ray resuscitates Blake. The survivors regroup at a relief camp on the other side of the bay, where the reconciled Ray and Emma talk about their future. On the remains of the Golden Gate Bridge, an American flag unfurls and gives hope that the city will recover and rebuild. Rescue vehicles descend on the destroyed landscape of the San Francisco Bay Area; the San Francisco Peninsula has been turned into an island and San Francisco Bay now extends from San Jose to Santa Cruz.",

    "title": "Zodiac",
    "plot": "On July 4, 1969, an unknown man attacks Darlene Ferrin and Mike Mageau with a handgun at a lovers' lane in Vallejo, California. Only Mike survives. One month later, the San Francisco Chronicle receives encrypted letters written by the killer calling himself \"Zodiac\", who threatens to kill a dozen people unless his coded message containing his identity is published. Political cartoonist Robert Graysmith, who correctly guesses that his identity is not in the message, is not taken seriously by crime reporter Paul Avery or the editors and is excluded from the initial details about the killings. When the newspaper publishes the letters, a married couple deciphers one, revealing it indeed did not contain the killer's name. In September, the killer stabs law student Bryan Hartnell and Cecelia Shepard at Lake Berryessa in Napa County; Cecelia dies two days later. At the office, Avery makes fun of Graysmith before they discuss the coded letters. Graysmith interprets the letter, which Avery finds helpful, and he begins sharing information. One of Graysmith's insights about the letters is that Zodiac's reference to man as \"the most dangerous animal of them all\" is a reference to the 1932 film The Most Dangerous Game, which features the villainous Count Zaroff, a man who hunts live human prey. Two weeks later, San Francisco taxicab driver Paul Stine is shot and killed in the city's Presidio Heights district. The Zodiac killer mails pieces of Stine's bloodstained shirt to the Chronicle along with a taunting letter. San Francisco police inspectors Dave Toschi and his partner Bill Armstrong are assigned to the case by Captain Marty Lee and work closely with Vallejo's Jack Mulanax and Captain Ken Narlow in Napa. Someone claiming to be Zodiac continues to send taunting letters and speaks on the phone with lawyer Melvin Belli on the KGO-TV morning talk show hosted by Jim Dunbar. In 1971, Detectives Toschi, Armstrong, and Mulanax question Arthur Leigh Allen, a suspect in the Vallejo case. They notice that he wears a Zodiac wristwatch, with the same logo used by the killer, and Toschi thinks he is the killer. However, a handwriting expert insists that Allen did not write the Zodiac letters, even though Allen is said to be ambidextrous. Avery receives a letter threatening his life; becoming paranoid, he turns to drugs and alcohol. He shares information with the Riverside Police Department that the killer might have been active before the initial killings, angering Toschi and Armstrong. The case's notoriety weighs on Toschi, who cannot sit through a Hollywood film, Dirty Harry, loosely based on the Zodiac case. By 1976, Avery has moved to the Sacramento Bee. Graysmith persistently contacts Toschi about the Zodiac murders and eventually impresses him with his knowledge of the case. While Toschi cannot directly give Graysmith access to the evidence, he provides names in other police departments where Zodiac murders occurred. Armstrong transfers from the San Francisco Police homicide division, and Toschi is demoted for supposedly forging a Zodiac letter. Graysmith continues his own investigation, profiled in the Chronicle, and gives a television interview about the book he is writing on the case. He begins receiving phone calls from someone breathing heavily. As his obsession deepens, Graysmith loses his job, and his wife Melanie leaves him, taking their children. Graysmith learns that Allen lived close to Ferrin and probably knew her and that his birthday matches the one Zodiac gave when he spoke to one of Melvin Belli's maids. While circumstantial evidence seems to indicate his guilt, the physical evidence, such as fingerprints and handwriting samples, do not implicate him. In 1983, Graysmith tracks Allen to a Vallejo Ace Hardware store, where he is employed as a sales clerk; they stare at each other before Graysmith leaves. Eight years later, after Graysmith's book, Zodiac, has become a bestseller, Mike Mageau identifies Allen from a police mugshot. A textual epilogue says that Allen died before police could question him and that the case remains open.",

    "plot": "At a party, teenager Courtney is convinced by her friends to download Countdown, an app that seemingly predicts how long a user has left to live. Courtney is startled to see it says she only has three hours left to live. After avoiding getting into a car with her drunk boyfriend Evan, Courtney receives a notification stating she has broken the \"user agreement\". Returning home, she is attacked by an unseen entity and killed as her timer reaches zero. At the same time, Evan crashes his car and a tree branch impales the seat where Courtney would have been sitting. Quinn Harris, a nurse who works at the hospital where Evan is admitted, dismisses his claims of a supernatural app but subsequently downloads it, only for the app to claim that she has only two days left to live. Evan skips his surgery and is informed he has violated the user agreement. He tries escaping the hospital, but is confronted by an apparition of Courtney in a stairwell before being killed by the entity. When Quinn finds out that Evan has died, she enters the morgue and checks his phone, which indicates no time left in the app. Concerned that she will die the next day, Quinn declines to go out with her family to visit her mother's grave. The app informs her that she has violated the user agreement. Shortly afterward, her boss Dr. Sullivan sexually harasses her and thwarts her attempt to report his offense to her supervisor. When Quinn researches the app, she finds that similar deaths have supposedly occurred involving other users, but the public generally considers them to be fake. She attempts to buy a new phone but finds that Countdown has downloaded itself onto it. After being attacked by a demonic figure in the parking lot of the cell phone store, Quinn meets a young man named Matt, whose Countdown states he will die in 18 hours. They learn that the user agreement is broken if the user tries changing their fate: Quinn's trip with her family, and Matt taking a train ride, which they both canceled, should have resulted in their original deaths. At work, Quinn learns Sullivan has tricked the staff into thinking she sexually harassed him, resulting in her suspension. She and Matt consult a priest named Father John, who informs them that the app is linked to a demon named Ozhin, originally summoned by a Roma woman who told a prince when he would die. Cell phone salesman Derek hacks into the app code and identifies that Quinn's younger sister, Jordan, was meant to die shortly before Quinn, then adds several decades to Quinn, Jordan's, and Matt's lives. However, while Matt and Quinn spend the night together, the entity takes the form of Matt and attacks Quinn. To their shock, their countdowns, including Jordan's, reset to their original lifespans. Jordan receives a notification of her countdown changing to the original lifespan and is then terrorized by a demonic form of her and Quinn's deceased mother. Quinn and Matt rescue her and return to Father John, who theorizes the curse can be broken if someone dies before their countdown ends or lives beyond their countdown. They prepare a warding circle in an attempt to delay Ozhin. The demon arrives and the circle initially wards off the demon, until it suddenly lures them outside, killing Matt and wounding Jordan in the process. While in grief over Matt's fate, Jordan starts having acute abdominal pain. Realizing her sister is seriously hurt, Quinn rushes Jordan to the hospital. Once there, she realizes she can kill Sullivan before his allotted time and break the curse. She attempts to attack him, but he is saved by Ozhin, who simultaneously prepares to kill Jordan. As Ozhin is terrorizing Jordan, Quinn overdoses on drugs before her timer ends and proves the app wrong. With instructions that Quinn gave her, Jordan revives her sister with Naloxone and their countdown timers stop. Sometime later, while visiting her and Jordan's mother's grave, Quinn receives word of Sullivan's arrest after more nurses have come forward, but discovers that an app called Countdown 2.0 has downloaded itself onto her phone, much to the sisters' horror. In a mid credits scene, Derek is seen on a Tinder date. While his date goes to the restroom, his Countdown app causes the light to go out and Ozhin to attack him.",

    "plot": "In Chandler, Arizona, FBI special agents Kate Macer and Reggie Wayne lead a raid on a Sonora Cartel safe house, where they discover dozens of decaying corpses hidden in the walls. Outside, an explosive booby trap kills two police officers. Following the raid, Kate is recommended for and joins a joint task force overseen by CIA SAC officer Matt Graver and the secretive Alejandro Gillick, a Colombian prosecutor turned CIA-trained assassin. Their mission is to flush out and apprehend Sonora lieutenant Manuel Díaz, currently operating and hiding in the United States. The team, which includes Delta Force operators, Deputy US Marshals, and CIA personnel, travels to Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, to extradite Díaz's brother, Guillermo. While crossing the El Paso–Juárez border, the team is ambushed by low-level cartel hitmen, whom the Americans swiftly kill. During the gunfight, Kate is forced to kill a Federal Police officer, and is left visibly disturbed by the violence. Back in the U.S., Alejandro tortures Guillermo and learns that the cartel uses a tunnel near Nogales, Sonora, to smuggle drugs. Meanwhile, Kate confronts Matt, who reveals that the real mission is to disrupt Díaz's drug operations so he can lead them to his boss, drug lord Fausto Alarcón. Unnerved, Kate asks Reggie to join her for support. The task force raids a bank used to launder Díaz's money. After finding financial evidence, Kate and Reggie want to start a legal case against Díaz but are ordered to stand down to avoid jeopardizing the operation. At a bar, Reggie introduces Kate to Ted, a Phoenix Police officer. Kate and Ted become intimate at her apartment, but she realizes Ted is working with the cartel. In the ensuing struggle, Ted begins to strangle Kate before Alejandro appears and subdues him. Alejandro and Matt brutally beat and threaten Ted to coerce him into revealing the names of other officers working for Díaz. After the team learns that Díaz has been recalled to Mexico, they prepare to raid the tunnel near Nogales. Matt reveals to Kate and Reggie that their involvement is a technical necessity as the CIA is not allowed to operate alone within US borders. An angered Reggie tells Kate they should leave, but she insists on staying to learn about the mission's true purpose. As a gunfight with the cartel begins, Kate follows Alejandro into Mexico. She sees him abduct Silvio, a corrupt Sonora police officer working as one of Díaz's drug mules. Kate attempts to arrest Alejandro, but he shoots her twice in her Kevlar vest to subdue her, angrily telling her to never point a gun at him again, before driving away with Silvio at gunpoint. On the U.S. side of the border, Kate confronts Matt, who explains the mission is part of a broader operation to revert the various drug cartels back to a single Colombian-run business that the U.S. can more easily control and work with. Alejandro, who previously worked for the Medellín Cartel, was hired to assassinate Alarcón, the man responsible for ordering the murder of Alejandro's wife and daughter when he was a prosecutor in Juárez. Alejandro kills Silvio after he stops Díaz's vehicle and forces Díaz to drive to Alarcón's estate. On arrival, he quickly kills Díaz and Alarcón's guards; finding the family seated to dinner, he vengefully kills Alarcón's wife and two sons first and then kills Alarcón. The next day, Alejandro appears in Kate's apartment and forces her at gunpoint to sign a statement attesting that the entire operation was legal. As he leaves, she aims her pistol at him and Alejandro turns to face her, but she cannot bring herself to pull the trigger. In Nogales, Silvio's widow watches her son's soccer game, which is briefly interrupted by the sound of distant machine-gun fire.",

    "plot": "Eric Matthew Daniels, an ex-Army Ranger, is driving with his 16-year old sister Maddie and encounters traffic on the Tobin Memorial Bridge outside Boston, Massachusetts. There is a holdup as police transport prisoner Samantha \"Doc\" Brown. Revolutionists led by Jimmy use explosives to break the bridge in half, causing chaos. Eric calls 911 and requests SWAT, but has difficulty convincing the dispatch operators about the severity of the events. The revolutionists kill the driver of the police truck and threaten the people stranded on the bridge. They take away cell phones and zip-tie the drivers' hands to their steering wheels. After Eric frees himself, he gets out of his truck and fatally stabs the revolutionist Tango. Galotti is revealed to have been a 'mole', and is congratulated by Jimmy for helping the guerillas capture the police truck. Doc Brown steals keys from Mr. Wisdom and unlocks her shackles, but does not escape. Jimmy uses a bazooka to blast a news chopper out of the sky to stun law enforcement. He uses the website freedomrevolutions.org to broadcast footage from the bridge, fatally shooting Galotti for everyone to see. Eric uses a recovered cellphone to call his sister Maddie; he kills the revolutionary guard by Doc's truck. Over 10 million people view a video uploaded by Jimmy of the hostage situation; he talks to the police with ransom demands. He says Doc falsely testified that Retcon squad one three killed innocent civilians without sanction, and wants a deal with the Pentagon to release the Retcon soldiers. Eric takes his sister out of the car. Doc escapes from her cage after being strangled by Golf, one of Jimmy's men, and pretends be unconscious. Jimmy uses a drone and catches a glimpse of Eric's face. Eric gets on a motorcycle with his sister to jump over the gap in the bridge, but is prevented from doing so by Jimmy, who blows another hole in the bridge. Eric and Maddie come down one level under the bridge and see a set of explosives rigged to blow up more of the underside of the bridge. Maddie asks Eric to help the hostages, so they climb back up and befriend Ozzie, who takes Maddie in his car and gives Eric his phone. Doc is captured by Jimmy, who knocks her down and ties her up. The video of the hostage situation has now reached 47 million viewers. Jimmy swallows some pills and thuds to his knees. As the pills fall on the ground, Doc recognizes them as cancer drugs, so Jimmy admits having a brain tumor. Eric goes under the bridge and is able to defuse the bombs there, but Maddie is captured. Jimmy forces her to speak with Eric, making him surrender. Jimmy gives Doc a document to read on camera, with a confession that she was once with Retcon One Three, and that a \"Shattered Dove initiative\" explicitly permitted civilian deaths during the pursuit of high-value targets. Meanwhile, Eric frees himself and attacks Jimmy, causing Maddie to escape and Doc to get shot. Eric is beaten and restrained by Jimmy, who reveals extra contingency explosives in his truck, besides what was underneath the bridge. He picks up a dead man's trigger connected to them, and uses a rope to drop down from the bridge and set off the explosives. But before he can do so, Eric uses a gun to press down on the truck's gas pedal so the truck falls on Jimmy and sets off the explosives killing only him and his extraction team below. Three weeks later, a Congressional hearing is held for the misuse of military contractors. Doc is freed due to her valor and heroism, and Eric and Maddie take her out for a cup of coffee.",

    "plot": "Four years after the heist at the Bellagio, Terry Benedict locates all eleven members of Danny Ocean’s crew and demands they return the $160 million they stole—plus $38 million in interest. He gives them a two-week deadline to repay the debt, threatening imprisonment or death. With their funds depleted, the crew travels to Amsterdam to stage a new heist that will avoid U.S. jurisdiction. Saul declines to participate, citing his age. The crew is tipped off by an informant named Matsui about the location of the first stock certificate ever issued, but after a complex operation, they discover it has already been stolen by a rival thief known as the “Night Fox.” Europol detective Isabel Lahiri, an ex-girlfriend of Rusty Ryan, is assigned to investigate the theft. Recognizing a pattern from a prior case they had discussed during their relationship, she deduces Rusty's involvement and warns the crew they are outmatched by the Night Fox and his mentor, the elusive master thief Gaspar LeMarc. The Night Fox is revealed to be François Toulour, a wealthy and agile French baron who resides in a villa on Lake Como. Enraged that LeMarc once suggested Danny Ocean might be the superior thief, Toulour admits to exposing the crew's identities to Benedict and orchestrating their recruitment by Matsui. Seeking to prove himself, he challenges Danny to steal the Imperial Coronation Fabergé egg in exchange for paying off the crew's debt if they succeed. Ocean's crew devises a plan to swap the egg with a holographic replica during its exhibition in Rome. However, Toulour intercepts their strategy by sending surveillance footage to Lahiri, who apprehends most of the crew. Linus, along with Basher, Turk, and Saul, implements an alternate plan involving Tess Ocean posing as a pregnant Julia Roberts to gain access to the egg. Their efforts are foiled when Lahiri intervenes, aided by an appearance from Bruce Willis. The remaining team members are arrested. As Linus is prepared for extradition, the FBI agent assigned to escort him is revealed to be his mother, who orchestrates the release of the entire crew. She confronts Lahiri over her forged Europol paperwork and advises that Lahiri's superior wants her back in Amsterdam immediately. Later, Danny and Tess visit Toulour, who boasts of his successful theft of the egg using acrobatic prowess to bypass museum security. However, Danny reveals that his crew had already stolen the real egg while it was being transported to the exhibit, having been tipped off by LeMarc. A flashback shows Danny and Rusty meeting LeMarc earlier, who offered them the opportunity to outwit Toulour and reclaim the egg he had once stolen and returned at his wife's request. Toulour concedes defeat and transfers the funds needed to repay Benedict. Rusty brings Lahiri to a safe house where she reunites with her long-lost father, who is revealed to be LeMarc. The crew repays Benedict and vows to avoid his casinos in the future, while Toulour, watching in disguise from a distance, continues to brood over his loss.",

    "plot": "After finishing a mission in Kiev, IMF agent Jim Phelps and his latest team are sent to Prague to stop rogue agent Alexander Golitsyn from stealing the CIA's NOC (non-official cover) list, which reveals the identities of all their undercover agents in Europe. However, the list is stolen, and the team is killed one by one, along with Golitsyn, leaving Jim's pointman Ethan Hunt the only survivor. During a debriefing with IMF director Eugene Kittridge in a restaurant, Ethan realizes that another IMF team was present during the mission and that the operation was a setup to lure out a mole within the IMF with the help of Golitsyn, who was posing as the rogue agent. The mole is believed to be working with an arms dealer named \"Max\" as part of \"Job 314\". Realizing that Kittridge suspects he is the mole, Ethan escapes, using a plastic explosive disguised as chewing gum. After returning to the Prague safe house, Ethan realizes \"Job 314\" actually refers to Bible verse Job 3:14, with \"Job\" being the mole's code name. Jim's wife Claire, who faked her death during the mission, arrives and explains that before his death, Jim warned her that they were compromised, which enabled her escape. Ethan arranges a meeting with Max to warn her that her NOC list is fake and that it is equipped with a tracking device. Despite Max's initial skepticism, they escape a raid by Kittridge's team. Ethan convinces Max that he can obtain the actual NOC list for $10 million and Job's true identity. Ethan and Claire recruit two disavowed IMF agents, high-level hacker Luther Stickell and pilot-turn-traitor Franz Krieger. They infiltrate CIA headquarters in Langley, steal the authentic list in an elaborate heist, and escape to London. Krieger takes the magneto-optical disk containing the list, but Ethan tricks him into giving it up before giving it to Luther for safekeeping. Kittridge has Ethan's mother and uncle falsely arrested to lure Ethan out. After learning about the arrests, Ethan contacts Kittridge from a payphone, intentionally allowing the IMF to trace the call. Jim resurfaces unexpectedly, recounts surviving the shooting, and tells Ethan that Kittridge is the mole. However, Ethan has already realized that Jim is the mole after discovering that the Bible he used in Prague was taken from Chicago's Drake Hotel, where Jim was stationed on a previous assignment. Ethan pretends to believe Jim and arranges to exchange the list with Max aboard the TGV train to Paris, secretly inviting Kittridge to the meeting. On the train, Ethan directs Max to the list, and she sends him to the baggage car where the money and Job are located. Meanwhile, Luther sabotages Max's upload of the list to her servers. Claire goes to the car to collect her share of the money from Jim but realizes he is Ethan in disguise. When the real Jim arrives and takes the money at gunpoint, Ethan sends a live video of the confrontation to Kittridge, exposing Jim as the mole. Claire tries reasoning with her husband, but Jim kills her and subdues Ethan. Jim climbs to the train's roof and attempts to flee with Krieger in a helicopter using a rope, but Ethan hooks it onto the train, forcing the helicopter into the Channel Tunnel. He uses another piece of explosive to destroy the chopper, killing Jim and Krieger. Kittridge takes Max into custody and recovers the NOC list from Luther. As he and Luther are reinstated in the IMF, Ethan is unsure about returning to the team. On the flight home, an attendant approaches him and covertly offers him the chance to take on a new mission as team leader.",

    "title": "Snake Eyes",
    "plot": "During a tropical storm named \"Jezebel,\" corrupt and flamboyant Atlantic City police detective Rick Santoro attends a boxing match at the soon-to-close local arena between heavyweight champion Lincoln Tyler and challenger Jose Pacifico Ruiz. He meets up with his best friend since childhood, U.S. Navy Commander Kevin Dunne, who is working with the Department of Defense to escort Defense Secretary Charles Kirkland and Arena director Gilbert Powell at the fight after a trip to Norfolk, Virginia. As the first round begins, Kevin is distracted by an attractive redhead named Serena who wears a ruby ring, and leaves his seat, which is then taken by Julia Costello, a mysterious woman with platinum blonde hair and a white satin suit. When Ruiz unexpectedly knocks out Tyler, gunshots ring out, mortally wounding Kirkland and grazing Julia, who loses her glasses and blonde wig, revealing her naturally dark hair. Kevin kills the sniper and orders the arena to be locked down. Despite the lockdown, Julia escapes into the casino, covers her wounds in pieces of cloth from her blouse and steals a black satin jacket to disguise herself. Rick notices that the supposedly knocked-out Tyler awoke instantly at the sound of the shots, and after studying the fight tape, realizes the knockout punch didn't connect. Tyler confesses that he threw the fight in order to pay gambling debts, but he was never told that anyone would be killed and reveals that Serena, the redhead who tricked Kevin into leaving his post, paid him to take a dive. With Tyler, Serena and the sniper, along with the man who signaled Tyler to go down and whoever gave him the go-ahead involved, Rick suspects a conspiracy. He reveals everything he has learned to Kevin, who confesses that the trip to Norfolk was to test the AirGuard missile defense system, which Powell's company was backing. He deduces that the sniper, a known Palestinian terrorist named Tarik Ben Rabat, assassinated Kirkland over the Pentagon's large-scale defense cooperation with and weapons systems transfers to Israel. Rick studies surveillance footage to find Serena while Kevin continues searching for Julia, aided by Powell's security guards. However, once they split up, it is revealed that Kevin is actually the fifth party and masterminded the conspiracy. He kills his underlings Serena and Zeitz (the man who signaled Tyler to go down) in order to prevent their further involvement and then conceals their bodies, aided by his bodyguards. Kevin then enlists Tyler by revealing the truth to him. Julia seduces Ned Campbell, a sleazy guest at the hotel, so she can hide in his room. Both Rick and Kevin discover this simultaneously and give chase, but Rick reaches her first and takes her into protective custody. Julia confesses that she is an analyst who worked on the AirGuard tests and discovered the results were faked to make the missile defense system look like it was working when it actually was not; the system failed, and she tipped off Kirkland to the deception. However, Kevin discovered her actions and arranged the entire conspiracy to kill both her and Kirkland, using Rabat's background as a terrorist and arranging to have him kill the SECDEF and then be immediately killed himself. Rick discovers Kevin's involvement and, despite initially refusing to believe it, accepts the truth. After hiding Julia in a warehouse, Rick inspects the footage of a new floating camera and discovers proof of his friend's involvement. Kevin confronts Rick and confesses that his motive was to prevent any further attacks on U.S. ships, similar to one on the USS Renville, where Kevin had to leave 28 men to drown in order to prevent the ship from sinking following an Iraqi missile strike. He offers Rick one million dollars for Julia's location. When Rick refuses, since the only thing he said is that Julia did nothing wrong, Kevin has Tyler beat him up, but he still does not give in. Kevin plants a tracker on Rick and follows him to the warehouse just as Hurricane Jezebel hits Atlantic City. When a tidal wave hits the boardwalk, Rick uses it as cover to rush Julia outside, where the police, tipped off by Rick, are waiting and witness Kevin opening fire. Unable to escape the police and a news crew, despite his protests that Julia is a suspect, Kevin commits suicide on live news feed. Rick is later hailed as a hero, but the press soon uncovers his corruption and he loses his job, mistress, and family. Before reporting for his prison term, Rick meets Julia on the boardwalk. She thanks him for his help, as Powell is completely restructuring his company and scrapping the AirGuard. Rick promises to call her when he gets out in twelve to eighteen months. Ultimately, Serena's ruby ring is seen embedded in one of the concrete pillars of the new Powell Millennium Arena.",

    "plot": "Meteorology student Kate Carter works in Oklahoma with storm chasers Javi, Praveen, Addy, and Kate's boyfriend Jeb, to test a theory that launching sodium polyacrylate beads into a tornado might reduce its intensity. The attempt is unsuccessful as the tornado suddenly intensifies into an EF5, killing Jeb, Addy, and Praveen while Javi and Kate survive. Traumatized and wracked with guilt, Kate quits storm chasing. Five years later, Kate works at an NOAA office in NYC. Javi, working for mobile tornado radar company StormPAR, offers Kate a position with his team to test a new tornado scanning system using phased-array radar. Kate initially declines, but Javi sends a news report about a tornado that has destroyed a town. Kate and Javi join the StormPAR team in Oklahoma, including Javi's business partner, Scott. Meanwhile, popular YouTube storm chaser Tyler Owens, known as the \"Tornado Wrangler\", also arrives from Arkansas looking to capitalize on a predicted tornado outbreak. Tyler is joined by his crew of Boone, Dani, Dexter, and Lily, as well as British journalist Ben, who is writing a piece on storm chasing. StormPAR and Tyler's crew chase an EF1 tornado that touched down on a nearby wind farm, which the StormPAR team intends to scan using three radar scanners. Kate suffers a panic attack, rendering her unable to help Javi set up the final scanner. The next day, the team tracks a storm that produces another EF1 and a Satellite tornado that splits off. StormPAR chases the satellite as it intensifies into an EF3; they successfully deploy the scanners, although one is lost to the tornado while Kate and Javi barely escape its path. They drive to the nearby tornado-ravaged town of Crystal Springs to help recovery efforts, along with Tyler's crew. Having initially dismissed Tyler and his team as glory hounds, Kate is surprised to learn they use merchandise profits to aid tornado victims while StormPAR investor Marshall Riggs profiteers from StormPAR's work by purchasing tornado-damaged land at low prices. That night, Tyler invites Kate to a nearby rodeo in Stillwater. An EF4 tornado rapidly develops with little warning, forcing Kate, Tyler, and others to take shelter in an empty motel pool. In the aftermath, Kate confronts Javi about Riggs' intentions, causing an offended Javi to blame her for their friends' deaths. Distraught, Kate abandons Javi and retreats to her mother's farm in Sapulpa. Tyler follows her and uncovers Kate's past research. Kate initially declines Tyler's offer to help retry the experiment, but later accepts when Tyler points out it can still give people a fighting chance against tornadoes. The next day, they release the beads into a passing tornado, but it fails to dissipate. Using data scans provided by an apologetic Javi, Kate hypothesizes launching silver iodide into the tornado to ensure dissipation. Kate joins Tyler and his team as they track a tornado near El Reno, with the StormPAR team also in pursuit. The tornado becomes rain-wrapped and nearly hits Javi and Scott, who escape as the tornado catches fire from hitting an oil refinery. The tornado rapidly intensifies into a mile-wide EF5 that begins shifting towards El Reno. As Kate and the Wranglers head into town, Javi abandons Scott, quits his partnership with Riggs and StormPAR, and heads to El Reno to help after finally realizing how callous Riggs and his team are. Kate, Tyler, and their team, learning that shelters are full, evacuate the remaining townspeople into a movie theater when a derailed streetcar and debris trap Tyler. As Kate struggles to free him, Javi arrives to help save Tyler. With no basement to take shelter in and the tornado heading straight for the theater, Kate drives Tyler's truck into the center of the tornado. She fires the silver iodide into it, and after a brief struggle with the controls, she successfully launches the polyacrylate beads. The tornado rips the theater open, nearly pulling Lily and Tyler out, but the countermeasures take effect, and the tornado dissipates. Sometime later, as Kate waits at the airport for her flight back to NYC, Tyler shows up and attempts to persuade Kate to stay. Upon learning that increasing winds from a nearby storm system have delayed her flight, Kate departs with Tyler to give chase. A closing montage reveals that Ben's story centered on Kate, and that Kate, Tyler, Javi, and the Wranglers have launched a new tornado radar business.",

    "title": "Get Out",
    "plot": "On a suburban street at night, a black man walks alone, talking on the phone. A car pulls up to the curb beside him; sensing trouble, the man starts to walk away. A person wearing a helmet tackles and subdues the man, drags him into the car, and drives away. Chris Washington, a black photographer, travels to upstate New York for a weekend getaway to meet the family of his white girlfriend, Rose Armitage. On the way, they hit a deer, and Rose defends Chris when the officer asks for his ID as he was not driving. He has uncomfortable conversations with Rose's parents, Dean, a neurosurgeon, and Missy, a psychiatrist. Later, Rose's brother Jeremy arrives, and Chris observes eerie behavior from the family's black servants, Georgina and Walter. Missy tricks Chris into having a hypnotherapy session with her, using the sound of a spoon stirring in a teacup as a hypnotic trigger, ostensibly to cure his smoking addiction. While in a trance, Chris reveals that his mother was killed in a hit-and-run when he was a child, and he feels guilty because he waited too long to call for help. At Missy's prompting, Chris' consciousness falls into a dark void she calls the \"sunken place,\" where his body becomes temporarily paralyzed. The next morning, Chris no longer has a desire to smoke. Dozens of wealthy white guests arrive for the Armitages' annual get-together, and their remarks about Chris cause him to feel uncomfortable. Chris meets a blind art dealer, Jim Hudson, who takes an interest in his photography, and Logan King, another black man. Like Walter and Georgina, Logan behaves unnaturally, and he is married to a white woman thirty years older than him. When Chris photographs Logan, the camera flash causes Logan to become hysterical, rushing at Chris and frantically lashing out at him, telling him to \"get out.\" Logan is taken away by Dean, who later claims Logan had a seizure. The party guests appear to hold some sort of silent auction with a photo of Chris as the prize. Chris sends a photo of Logan to his friend, TSA officer Rod Williams, who recognizes Logan as Andre Hayworth, a missing man from Brooklyn. Chris discovers photos of Rose dating numerous black people, including Walter and Georgina, contradicting her earlier claim that Chris is the first black person she has dated. He tries to leave, but Rose refuses to give him the car keys. Jeremy and Dean block the doors and Missy hypnotizes Chris back to the sunken place. Chris awakens strapped to an armchair in the basement. In a video, an old man, who introduces himself as Roman Armitage, explains that his family transplants the brains of their wealthy friends into black people's bodies to acquire their desirable physical characteristics, leaving the host's consciousness trapped in the sunken place. Jim Hudson appears on the TV, explaining that he wants Chris's eyesight. Meanwhile, Rod, who has been trying to contact Chris and suspects foul play, goes to the police, but they do not believe his theory about the Armitages. Missy hypnotizes Chris again. However, it is revealed that he has blocked the trigger by plugging his ears with cotton stuffing from the armchair. Chris bludgeons Jeremy and then kills Dean (who falls and accidentally sets fire to the room) and Missy when she attacks him, before finishing off Jeremy when he attacks again. Chris tries to escape in Jeremy's Porsche but accidentally hits Georgina, who has the brain of Rose's grandmother, Marianne. Compelled by guilt over his mother's death, he picks her up to save her, but she attacks him, causing the car to crash and kill her. Rose and Walter, who has the brain of Rose's grandfather Roman, arrive to capture Chris. During a scuffle, Chris uses his phone's flash to briefly free Walter from Roman's control. Walter takes Rose's rifle, shoots her, and fatally shoots himself. Chris starts strangling Rose, but cannot bring himself to kill her. A police car arrives and Chris surrenders, with Rose believing that the police will arrest Chris and save her, but it is revealed to be Rod's TSA car. Rod picks up Chris, leaving Rose to bleed out on the side of the road.",

    "plot": "Willie Loomis, the Collins family handyman, is searching for old treasure in the family mausoleum when he accidentally frees Barnabas Collins, a 175-year-old vampire who enslaves him. Upon his release, he attacks Daphne Budd, the secretary to Collinwood's matriarch, Elizabeth Collins Stoddard. She is discovered by Jeff Clark, who takes her back to the house where Dr. Julia Hoffman attends to her. Later, Barnabas introduces himself to the family under the guise of a \"cousin from England\". Elizabeth and the others are intrigued by Barnabas and take an instant liking to him. However, Elizabeth's daughter, Carolyn Stoddard, and Professor T. Eliot Stokes, a friend of the family, are incredulous. Barnabas insists on moving into the Old House and hosting a ball in honour of the family. But on the night of the ball, Carolyn is bitten by Barnabas while she is getting ready. Later on at the ball, he is introduced to young David Collins' governess and Jeff's girlfriend, Maggie Evans, and is instantly smitten with her, as she bears a striking resemblance to his long-lost fiancée, Josette du Pres. Maggie is thinking about leaving Collinwood, but Barnabas persuades her to stay. Back at the Old House, he tells Willie about Josette and how she took her own life on the night they were to be married. Carolyn overhears and, out of jealousy, threatens to expose him . Enraged, Barnabas delivers a deadly bite to Carolyn, much to Willie's horror. A shaken Willie takes Carolyn back home; she slowly walks to the doorway, but she is soon discovered slumped in the doorway—dead—by the housekeeper, Mrs. Sarah Johnson. Funeral services are held for Carolyn, and she is buried in the Collins family mausoleum. Dr. Hoffman, upon analyzing samples of Carolyn's blood, recognizes a trace of elements of the same unknown virus that was present in Daphne Budd's blood sample. Thereafter, Professor Stokes confers with Julia and tells her that he suspects that the recent attacks in Collinsport may have been caused by a vampire. Julia is initially skeptical but soon becomes an ally of Stokes when he informs the family of his theory. Meanwhile, Carolyn rises as a vampire and menaces David. Stokes and Julia try to explain, but Elizabeth and her brother Roger Collins refuse to listen. Carolyn's fiancé, Todd Blake, encounters her, and she bites him. After he is taken back to Collinwood, the family realizes that Stokes and Julia were correct about the vampire. Todd again sneaks out in search of Carolyn, but she is cornered and staked, instantly destroying her. Julia eventually discovers that Barnabas is the vampire responsible. Thus, she visits him at the Old House and convinces him that she can use modern-day medicine to make him human, and he reluctantly agrees. Julia gives him injections that allow him to walk in the daylight and apparently no longer need to ingest human blood to survive. Over time, Barnabas and Maggie begin to spend time together while Jeff is away in Boston. Stokes confronts Julia about helping Barnabas—and realizes she is in love with him—and reminds her that he is in love with Maggie. Overcome with jealousy, Julia gives Barnabas an overdose of her serum, which causes him to age rapidly to his true age, 175 years. In a rage, he strangles her to death. A terrified Maggie witnesses this and tries to flee, but is caught and bitten by Barnabas before she can escape, and he vows to come back for her. Jeff soon returns, and he is informed of the family history by Stokes and Roger and that Barnabas intends to make Maggie his bride. That night, Barnabas bites Maggie again, rejuvenating him, and then abducts her. Jeff and the others pursue them; however, Roger and Stokes are killed (both turned into vampires whom Jeff destroys). Jeff eventually finds Maggie at an old church in a trance and in Josette's wedding gown. Willie warns him against trying to stop Barnabas and knocks him out. Willie leads Maggie out of the room to where Barnabas is waiting for her. He lays her down on an altar and is about to bite her when Jeff wakes up and shoots at him, but Willie, running to stop Barnabas, moves in the way, and is hit by Jeff's crossbow bolt. Barnabas lures Jeff out of his hiding place and forces him to be a witness by placing him in a trance. However, as Barnabas again attempts to bite Maggie, he screams in pain as he's struck in his back. Turning around, he's shocked, then enraged, to discover that Willie—in his final act of redemption—had stabbed him with the crossbow bolt. Barnabas strangles the mortally wounded Willie, but Loomis's attack breaks Jeff out of Barnabas's trance long enough for Jeff to finish driving the bolt through the vampire's back, ultimately bursting through his bloody chest. Maggie, now no longer entranced, is rescued by Jeff, both briefly observing the bodies of the presumably dead vampire and Willie Loomis before departing the ruined chapel. In a post-credits scene, Barnabas's body transforms into a bat and then flies away.",

    "plot": "In 1975, three childhood friends—Jimmy Markum, Sean Devine, and Dave Boyle—are playing on a Boston street in their Irish-American neighborhood when two predators posing as police officers abduct Dave. He is sexually assaulted for four days before managing to escape. One abductor dies before he can be prosecuted, and the other dies by suicide in prison. The trauma leaves Dave deeply scarred. Twenty-five years later, the men have grown apart. Jimmy, an ex-convict, now runs a neighborhood convenience store; Sean is a Massachusetts State Police detective dealing with the recent departure of his pregnant wife, Lauren; and Dave, a blue-collar worker, still struggles with the psychological aftermath of his childhood abduction. Dave is married to Celeste, whose cousin Annabeth is Jimmy's second wife, linking the men through family ties. Jimmy's teenage daughter Katie plans to elope to Las Vegas with Brendan Harris, the son of a man Jimmy despises. One night, Dave sees Katie at a bar. Later that evening, she is found murdered. That same night, Dave returns home bloodied and shaken, claiming to Celeste that he may have killed a mugger in self-defense. Sean and his partner, Whitey Powers, begin investigating the murder. Meanwhile, Jimmy conducts his own parallel inquiry using his connections. The detectives discover that the murder weapon is a .38 Special revolver tied to a 1984 liquor store robbery committed by Brendan's father, “Just Ray” Harris, who has been missing since 1989. Brendan insists he knows nothing about the gun, though he claims Ray still sends the family money monthly. Suspicion grows around Dave as his story changes and his behavior becomes erratic. Celeste, increasingly afraid, eventually confides in Jimmy, believing Dave killed Katie. Jimmy and his associates invite Dave to a bar, get him drunk, and press him for a confession. Dave admits to killing someone that night—but says it was a child molester, not Katie. Jimmy does not believe him. When Dave falsely confesses under pressure, Jimmy stabs him to death and disposes of his body in the Mystic River. Concurrently, Brendan discovers that his mute younger brother, “Silent Ray,” and their friend John O’Shea were involved in Katie's death as part of a prank that turned violent. He confronts them, but John pulls a gun. Before he can shoot, Sean and Whitey arrive and arrest both boys. The following morning, Sean informs Jimmy that Ray and John have confessed to Katie's murder. He also reveals that Dave is wanted for the killing of a known child molester. Jimmy says nothing about his role in Dave's death, merely thanking Sean for solving the case, and remarks, “If only you'd been a little faster.” Sean then pointedly asks whether Jimmy plans to send monthly payments to Celeste as well. Sean reconciles with his wife, Lauren, while Jimmy confesses to Annabeth, who tells him that he did what a \"king\" must do, no matter how difficult. During a neighborhood parade, Dave's young son waits for his father, unaware of his fate. Sean spots Jimmy and makes a finger gun gesture, suggesting retribution may still come, while Jimmy responds with an indifferent shrug.",

They have been married for five or six years, and their marriage is suffering from a lack of communication and acts of quiet aggression, such as Jane installing drapes that John said he disliked. They first met in Bogotá, Colombia, claiming to be together to avoid being questioned by Colombian authorities. The two had a whirlwind courtship and married. In secret, John and Jane are skilled field operatives working for separate contract-killing firms and are both among the best in their field. They are adept at concealing their true profession from each other. The Smiths live in a large Colonial Revival house in the New York City suburbs, keeping up appearances by reluctantly socializing with their \"conventionally\" wealthy neighbors. Underneath their cover stories, John and Jane balance their marriage (which is apparently mundane, dull and suffocating) with their careers. After they are both assigned to kill DIA prisoner Benjamin \"The Tank\" Danz in a prison transfer, they run into each other on the job and the hit is botched. Knowing that their spouse is a fellow assassin makes both John and Jane fear that their marriage was just a part of the cover story and that their spouse will try to kill them in order to prevent their secret from being exposed. Following a tense dinner, Jane sneaks off and drives away from their home. John pursues her in hopes of talking things out, but slips against a fence, causing him to accidentally fire a gunshot that nearly hits Jane, thus solidifying her fears. Jane works with her team and steals John's armoury from their home. Jane tries to kill John but he escapes every time. After several escalating attempts on each other's lives, the Smiths' conflict ends in a massive shootout which nearly demolishes their house. During a protracted and evenly-matched fight, John and Jane pull guns aiming at each other. John finally realizes he cannot kill Jane, even if it means she will kill him instead, and lays his gun down. Jane discovers that she cannot shoot John either, and they spend a passionate night together. The renewed Smith partnership is threatened by their employers, who join forces to eliminate the couple. Eddie, John's best friend and co-worker, turns down a bounty of $400,000 for each of them. The Smiths are attacked by an army of assassins. Their pockmarked house is blown up and the Smiths steal their neighbor's minivan. They destroy their attackers' pursuing armored sedans, while bickering about their fighting styles and personal secrets they have discovered about each other. They meet with Eddie and decide to save their marriage. The Smiths kidnap Danz from his high-security prison to use as a bargaining chip. Danz tells them that he is merely bait, an intern hired by each of their employers after they discovered the Smiths were married; his clients hoped the Smiths would kill each other. Discarding each of their contingency plans, the Smiths make a last stand together, fending off an assault inside a home decorating store by heavily armed operatives. In the aftermath, the Smiths meet their marriage counselor again and say that their marriage is thriving.",

    "title": "Shadow Force",
    "plot": "Eight years previously, Kyrah Owens and Issac Sarr were the leaders of a multinational special forces group called Shadow Force, a CIA clandestine operations team performing assassinations in the interest of the United States Government under the direction of Jack Cinder. But Issac and Kyrah fell in love, Kyrah became pregnant with their son Ky, and both abruptly went underground to raise their child in peace. Cinder, who has a volatile temper and does not suffer defeat lightly, has declined to forgive them for their act of \"treason\" against him, especially since he was obsessively interested in Kyrah himself. Cinder later left the CIA and eventually rose to the rank of Secretary General of G7, but recently his past career has come under close scrutiny by the United States' Inspector General's office. With Cinder sending elimination teams after them all the time, Kyrah has assumed the role of bait, leading Cinder's assassins away from her family and eliminating them one by one. One day, however, Issac and Ky get accidentally entangled in a bank heist. When one of the robbers threatens his son, Issac attacks and neutralizes them, thereby drawing the public media's attention. When Cinder sees the footage and realizes that the Sarrs have a child, he blacklists them before the assembled G7 representatives and summons the rest of Shadow Force to hunt them down. Issac retreats with Ky, who is marginally aware of his parents' background history, to a concealed shelter in the Colombian jungle, where Kyrah rejoins them. With Ky's life on the line, Issac and Kyrah decide to take the fight to Cinder before he can eliminate them, and summon Kyrah's relatives and CIA contacts Auntie and Unc for help. As the Sarrs move to another hideout, they barely escape an ambush by Shadow Force, leading them to suspect that either Unc or Auntie must have ratted on them. After getting to Cartagena and separating from her family, Kyrah calls Cinder and demands a personal meeting on Cinder's private island off Cartagena, lest she exposes every one of his secrets to the OIG. While she proceeds to the island, Issac and Ky meet Auntie and Unc in Bogotá. On the island, Kyrah and Cinder have a tense reunion which escalates into Kyrah trying to shoot him, only to be foiled by a custom made Kevlar vest she failed to notice. Issac, Ky, Auntie and Unc are captured by Shadow Force and brought to the island, where Unc is revealed as Cinder's informant, a fact that Auntie has suspected all along. The tables suddenly turn when Patrick and Parker, Cinder's closest aides, identify themselves as OIG special agents assigned to track Cinder's criminal activities; a gunfight erupts in which Cinder, Patrick and Parker are wounded and the rest of Shadow Force killed. While Auntie and Ky intercept Unc as he tries to run, Kyrah is stunned by an explosive booby trap and taken hostage by Cinder. When Issac arrives, Kyrah silently gives him permission to shoot Cinder through her shoulder, enabling them to overwhelm and kill him. Six months later, the Sarrs have openly resumed their civilian life. Kyrah gets a call from Auntie, who has decided to found a new, morally better Shadow Force and asks her to join, an offer which Kyrah declines for now. As they celebrate Ky's birthday, Kyrah reveals to Issac that she is pregnant with their next child.",

    "title": "Jack Reacher",
    "plot": "In Pittsburgh, a man drives a van into a parking garage across the Allegheny River from PNC Park, dropping a quarter into the meter. Using a rifle, he shoots and kills five people on the river's North Shore Trail from long range before driving off. The Pittsburgh Police, headed by Detective Calvin Emerson, find a shell casing and the quarter used to pay for parking. A fingerprint on the coin belongs to James Barr, an ex-US Army sniper. When the police raid his house, they find the van and rifle, along with Barr unconscious. During an interrogation by Emerson and District Attorney Alex Rodin, Barr is offered a choice between life in prison in exchange for a full confession or a guaranteed death sentence, as Rodin has never lost a case. Barr instead writes \"Get Jack Reacher\" on a notepad. Reacher is a drifter and ex-U.S. Army Military Police Corps investigator and major. He arrives in Pittsburgh after seeing a news broadcast about Barr. Emerson and Rodin deny Reacher's request to view the evidence, but agree to let him see Barr, who was attacked by fellow inmates and is now in a coma. Reacher meets Barr's defense attorney, Helen Rodin, Alex Rodin's daughter. She tells him he can see the evidence if he will be her investigator, but Reacher retorts that he is not interested in clearing Barr. He reveals that Barr had gone on a killing spree during his tour of duty during the Iraq War, but was not court-martialed because, unknown to Barr, his military contractor victims had just emerged from a weekend of raping Iraqi women, and the US Army just wanted the whole mess forgotten. Reacher had vowed to take Barr down if he ever tried anything like that again. He agrees to investigate if Helen visits the victims' families to learn about the people murdered that day. Reacher goes to the crime scene and finds inconsistencies. A trained sniper would have shot from a van on the nearby Fort Duquesne Bridge. An apparently random bar fight makes Reacher realize that someone is attempting to strong-arm him into dropping his investigation. After Helen reports her findings about the victims to Reacher, he suggests that the owner of a local construction company, Oline Archer, was the real target. In contrast, the other victims served as a cover-up in order to make it look like a mass shooting of victims merely picked at random, rather than attention being focused on just Oline Archer's murder. Reacher is later framed for the murder of Sandy, the young woman who was paid to instigate the brawl. Reacher eventually follows up a hunch to a shooting range in neighboring Ohio, owned by former United States Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant Martin Cash. The real perpetrators are working for a mobbed-up construction firm led by an ex-Soviet prisoner known only as Zek Chelovek (\"prisoner human being\"). Zek's gang kidnaps Helen with the aid of Detective Emerson and holds her hostage at a quarry. With Cash's help, Reacher kills the henchmen (including Charlie, the true culprit behind the shootings) and Emerson, before confronting the Zek. The Zek gleefully points out that Reacher has killed everyone who could have testified against him and vows to frame Reacher for his own crimes, while also stating that, even if he is convicted, an American prison will be \"a retirement home\" compared to his previous incarceration in the Gulag. Convinced, Reacher fatally shoots the Zek in the head. When Barr awakens from his coma, he tells Helen that he has no memory of the crime, but believes that he must be guilty. Barr's mental explanation of how he would have committed the shootings proves Reacher's theory. A remorseful Barr is still willing to accept both responsibility and punishment, but Helen is confident he will be cleared. Meanwhile, Reacher, sitting on a bus, overhears a man verbally and physically abusing a young woman and gets up to confront him.",

One year later, teenager Sienna Shaw is preparing her Halloween costume: a Valkyrie character designed by her recently deceased father. Her younger brother Jonathan has become fixated with Art since discovering art of him in their father's sketchbook. That night, Sienna has a nightmare about a commercial for \"The Clown Cafe\" in which Art appears. He kills various Clown Cafe patrons as Sienna tries to pull a sword from a box of cereal. She wakes from the dream in her bedroom, where a fire is burning the dresser the sword is resting on, but the sword is unscathed. That day, Jonathan sees Art and the Little Pale Girl at school playing with a dead opossum and is blamed when his principal discovers the carcass. Sienna has a panic attack when her friends Allie and Brooke discuss Victoria Heyes's mutilation of talk show host Monica Brown. Sienna and Allie go to the costume shop, where they encounter Art. Art kills the shop vendor before arriving at Allie's home trick or treating. Allie ridicules him because she thinks he’s too old to go trick or treating. Art later breaks into Allie's home and brutally maims her, keeping her flayed body alive long enough to traumatize her mother, whom he later kills. Jonathan shows Sienna and their mother Barbara their father's sketchbook, filled with newspaper clippings revealing that the Little Pale Girl bears resemblance to Art's first victim Emily Crane. He believes their father knew how to stop Art, saying that he gifted her the sword for that purpose. Sienna departs for a Halloween party; Jonathan flees after Barbara slaps him. She is then shot and killed by Art, and when Jonathan returns home, Art kidnaps him and steals Sienna's sword. At the Halloween party, Brooke spikes Sienna's drink; Sienna has a panic attack after seeing the Little Pale Girl in the crowd. Brooke's boyfriend Jeff drives them home when Sienna is lured to The Terrifier attraction at the old abandoned carnival. The Little Pale Girl mimics Jonathan's voice over the phone, pleading for a ride home, while Sienna goes searching alone. After a big argument on the way, Art castrates and murders Jeff. Brooke is chased into the park and murdered as well, while Sienna is beaten unconscious. Sienna awakens to find Art using a scalpel on her brother and begins attacking him with his own weapons. The siblings discover Art is immortal and he wears them out with his endurance. He stabs Sienna with her father's sword and throws her into a portal to hell where she encounters the \"Clown Cafe\" again. Sienna dies but is resurrected by the sword. She decapitates Art while he is biting into Jonathan's calves. The Little Pale Girl takes his head and leaves as Sienna and Jonathan embrace.

His co-worker Sherry Margrave is romantically interested in him, but Nathan is hesitant due to his condition and inexperience with women. At a bar with Sherry, Nathan encounters his middle-school bully, who calls him \"Novocaine\". Sherry gets revenge for Nathan by tricking the bully into drinking a shot of hot sauce. The next morning, on Christmas Eve, a gang of robbers led by Simon Greenly rob the credit union. Simon murders Nathan's boss Nigel and takes Sherry as a hostage. Nathan impulsively steals a police car in pursuit of the car in which Sherry is being held, but he follows the wrong car and ends up in a confrontation with another robber, Ben Clark, in a restaurant kitchen. He eventually shoots Ben dead, but not before severely burning his hand while retrieving Ben's gun from a deep fryer. After noticing Ben's tattoo, Nathan asks his only friend, Roscoe Dixon, a gamer whom he has never met in person, to help him find the artist. He successfully tracks down the artist, Zeno, and interrogates him for Ben's address, hoping to find Sherry. After a brawl, Nathan obtains Ben's last name from Zeno, and he calls a colleague to find Ben's home address using his loan documents. Ben's house is booby-trapped, and Nathan ends up stuck in a snare; in desperation, he calls Roscoe. Ben's brother Andre enters the house and begins to torture Nathan, who feigns feeling pain. Roscoe arrives, and together they overpower and kill Andre. Police officer Mincy Langston and her partner Coltraine Duffy arrive at the house and arrest Roscoe, who has switched clothes with Nathan. Nathan locates Sherry and Simon at an auto shop and discovers she is Simon's adoptive sister and an accomplice to the heist. She originally intended to seduce Nathan to learn the bank vault code but developed real feelings for him and was horrified that Simon needlessly murdered her boss, Nigel. Simon tries to kill Nathan against Sherry's protests, but he is shot by an arriving Coltraine, while Sherry and Nathan are arrested. Simon in turn shoots Coltraine dead and wounds Mincy, escaping in the ambulance holding Nathan. Sherry frees herself from the handcuffs, and she pursues the ambulance while Roscoe drives a wounded Mincy to the hospital. After regaining consciousness, Nathan breaks free from the handcuffs and defibrillates Simon, causing him to crash. Having had enough of Nathan, Simon breaks his arm just as Sherry arrives. As he is about to kill Sherry, Nathan injects himself with adrenaline and kills Simon by sticking his exposed arm bone through Simon's jaw before falling unconscious. When Nathan awakes in a hospital two weeks later, he learns he has been sentenced to six months of house arrest and five years of probation instead of a lengthy prison sentence due to his saving the life of the police officer whose car he took.

    "plot": "In 1995, a hiker's vanishing in the remote mountains of Oregon sparks speculation about a virus transmitted by the region's wildlife, dubbed \"Hill Fever\" by locals but called ma'iingan odengwaan, or \"Face of the Wolf\", by Native American tribes. During a hunting trip in the area, a young Blake Lovell leaves his stern father Grady to hunt a deer and spots a mysterious humanoid creature. Grady catches up and takes him to hide in an elevated hunting blind. The monster comes close to catching them but is distracted by the deer. When Grady informs his friend Dan Kiel about the beast, implied to be the infected hiker, Dan turns down his suggestion to hunt it to protect Blake and Dan's son Derek. Thirty years later, Blake lives in San Francisco with his daughter Ginger and wife Charlotte, a journalist, where he works from home as a writer. Like his now-estranged father, he struggles to control his temper when he senses Ginger is in trouble, while Charlotte struggles with not spending enough time at home with their daughter and feeling estranged from her own family, causing a strain in their relationship. One day, he receives a death certificate for Grady, who went missing, and the keys to his childhood home. He decides to vacation there to pack up his father's belongings and to try repairing his marriage. Seeking directions in the forest, the family encounters Derek, who leads them to the house as the sun sets. Before they arrive, Blake swerves and drives off the side of the road at the sight of a creature like the one he saw as a child. The creature breaks into the truck, scratches Blake's arm, and kills Derek. Blake frantically leads his family to the house, turning on the generator and barricading the entrance as the monster searches for weak spots. With his arm bloody and infected, Blake starts losing teeth, sweating profusely, and experiencing noise and odor sensitivity. Hearing the creature howl, he puts his ear to a side door, only for the monster to grab his foot through the pet door and injure him further before Charlotte stops it by hitting it with a hammer. After Blake passes out and wakes up, Charlotte discovers he has lost some motor functions and his ability to speak and understand human language. He develops canine teeth and night vision, his hair starts thinning, and as Charlotte removes the bandages on his arm, he gnaws on it like an animal. While his skin blisters and patchy fur grows on his body, Charlotte spots Grady's run-down truck outside and jump-starts it. Before the family can drive away, the creature smashes the windshield, revealing itself as a werewolf and forcing them to seek shelter atop a greenhouse. Blake signals Charlotte to take Ginger back to the house and runs in the opposite direction to make the monster follow him. Ginger argues with Charlotte about leaving Blake to die before a limping and more deformed Blake returns. He tries to play a game with Ginger before he vomits one of the werewolf's fingers and menacingly approaches Charlotte. Regaining control, he prepares to leave to keep his family safe from the danger he is becoming, but as he opens the door, the werewolf tackles him. Blake puts himself between the monster and his family, and in the struggle, he bites the creature's throat and kills it. Recognizing a military tattoo on its arm, Blake realizes the werewolf is the infected Grady. He runs outside in another attempt to leave, and his bone structure undergoes its final changes, with claws forcing out his fingernails, while his vision becomes warped. Now fully transformed like his father, Blake, still self-aware but unable to restrain his primal instincts, breaks back into the house and positions himself behind Ginger. Charlotte slashes his hand with a knife and escapes with her. Blake claws his way into a nearby barn and tries sneaking towards his family in the dark, but is caught by a foothold trap that Charlotte laid down. He chews off his ensnared foot and continues pursuing as Charlotte and Ginger escape and hide in the hunting blind as the sun rises. Blake climbs up and surfaces over the door, and Charlotte points a rifle at him. Charlotte believes her husband has lost his humanity, but Ginger, described earlier by her father as always able to tell what he is thinking, convinces her that Blake is in pain and wants to die. The family shares a final look as Blake breaks through the door and Charlotte fatally shoots him. They comfort a dying Blake before walking out of the forest, taking in the beauty of a valley he once described seeing as a child.",

Presenting at a medical symposium, Ledgard privately discloses he has also conducted illegal transgenic experiments on humans. He is forbidden to continue with his research. On his secluded estate, Ledgard holds a young woman named Vera captive with the help of his servant Marilia. There he continues his experiments. While Ledgard is out, Marilia's estranged son Zeca, arrives and asks to hide there for a few days, having committed a robbery. Seeing Vera on Ledgard's security camera screens, Zeca mistakes her for Ledgard's deceased wife, Gal, and demands to see her in person. When Marilia refuses, Zeca binds and gags Marilia and then rapes Vera. Ledgard arrives and kills Zeca. While Ledgard disposes of Zeca's corpse, Marilia reveals to Vera that both Zeca and Ledgard are half-brothers and her sons, unbeknownst to them. Ledgard was adopted by Marilia's employers, while Zeca wasn't. While Ledgard went to medical school and married a woman named Gal, Zeca moved out to the streets and smuggled drugs. Years later, Zeca and Gal fell in love and ran off together. They were involved in a car crash which badly burnt Gal. Assuming she was dead, Zeca left the scene. Ledgard took Gal home and kept her in total darkness without any mirror to hide her burn scars. One day, while hearing her daughter Norma singing in the garden, Gal sees her own reflection in the window. Traumatized by the sight, Gal jumps to her death in front of Norma. Ledgard's dream reveals that six years earlier, he found his daughter Norma unconscious on the ground at a wedding party, presumably having been raped. Already mentally unstable after witnessing her mother's suicide and under effects of psychosis medication, a disoriented Norma saw Ledgard bending over her and mistakenly believed he raped her. Having developed a fear of all men, Norma spent years in a mental health facility, and eventually committed suicide. Vera, meanwhile, also dreams of the same event. A man named Vicente met Norma at the wedding party. In the garden, under the influence of drugs, they began getting intimate. While they are laying on the ground, the music plays the song Norma was singing when she witnessed her mother's death, triggering her and she started screaming. Vicente frantically attempted to hush her screams, but accidentally knocked her unconscious. Vicente fled the scene, his exit noticed by Ledgard. Ledgard tracked down and kidnapped Vicente. Holding him captive, Ledgard brutalizes Vicente to wear down his resistance. As punishment for ostensibly raping his daughter, Ledgard forcibly performed sex change operations and reconstructive surgeries on Vicente using transgenesis and gene delivery, turning him into a replica of his late wife giving him real breasts, an actual woman's voice and real female buttocks, and renamed him Vera. Over a period of six years, Vicente complies with Ledgard's experimentation to stay alive, and struggles to keep himself sane. During the night, Ledgard initiates sex, but Vera tells him that it is still painful after Zeca's rape. Ostensibly going to find lubricant, Vera retrieves Ledgard's gun and kills him. When Marilia barges into the bedroom, Vera fatally shoots her as well. Freed from captivity, Vicente returns to his mother's dress shop. Tearfully, he tells his lesbian ex-colleague Cristina, whom Vicente had loved six years prior, of his kidnapping, forced sex change, and the murders. As his mother enters the room, Vicente quietly reveals his identity to her: \"I am Vicente.\"",

    "plot": "Professional thief Danny Ocean is released from a New Jersey prison after serving four years. Upon his release, he meets one of his former associates, con man Frank Catton (in disguise as a dealer), at a Jersey casino. When the two meet afterwards in a bar, Ocean tells Catton about a plan to rob three Las Vegas casinos - the Bellagio, the Mirage, and the MGM Grand. Ocean then travels to Los Angeles to reunite with his former partner, Rusty Ryan. Together they approach their wealthy associate Reuben Tishkoff in Las Vegas with Ocean's proposal to rob the casinos—all owned by Tishkoff's rival, Terry Benedict. Eager to exact revenge on Benedict for demolishing his casino to make way for \"some gaudy monstrosity\", Tishkoff agrees. The trio then recruit eight specialists to carry out the heist: con man Frank Catton, retired grifter Saul Bloom, demolitions expert Basher Tarr, surveillance technician Livingston Dell, acrobat Yen, pickpocket Linus Caldwell, and the Malloy twins, Virgil and Turk, who serve as mechanics and drivers. Upon gathering everyone, Ocean holds a meeting in Tishkoff's house and explains the plan to rob the three casinos; according to the Nevada Gaming Commission, Ocean says, a casino must hold enough cash in reserve to cover every chip in rotation on the floor. Ocean explains that on the night the group plans to rob the casinos, there will be over $150 million in cash due to it being a fight night. A full-scale replica of the casino vault is constructed for practice, and each team member is assigned tasks to infiltrate the casinos, gather intel, and prepare for the operation. Linus, while tailing Benedict, learns that he is dating Tess, Ocean's ex-wife. Concerned that Ocean's true motivation is personal, Ryan considers aborting the plan, but Ocean insists on moving forward. Ocean later confronts Tess, rekindling unresolved tensions, and meets with Benedict, who has him forcibly removed and barred from his properties. On the night of the heist, Ocean deliberately gets himself captured by Benedict's security and detained in a surveillance-free room, where he is secretly aided by an accomplice. Meanwhile, the team initiates the plan: Saul, disguised as a high-roller, convinces Benedict to store a briefcase of valuable \"jewels\"—actually explosives—in the vault; Yen is smuggled inside the vault via a service cart; and Basher activates an electromagnetic pulse that disables power to the casino, including its security systems. With the power down, Ocean and Caldwell descend into the vault, subdue the guards, and use the disguised explosives to breach the vault door. Rusty contacts Benedict, informing him of the robbery and demanding that half the vault's contents be delivered to a waiting van or the entire haul will be destroyed. Benedict complies, only to later discover that the van was a decoy filled with worthless flyers and controlled remotely. Simultaneously, a SWAT team storms the vault and detonates the remaining explosives, seemingly destroying the remaining cash. However, Benedict soon realizes the footage he saw of the vault was fabricated, as the floor lacks the recently added Bellagio logo. It is revealed that the crew had impersonated the SWAT team, entered the vault under that guise, and exited with the stolen money in duffel bags. Ocean, having returned to the secure room, is confronted by Benedict but is not implicated in the crime. Tess watches a surveillance feed showing Benedict choosing the money over her, prompting her to leave him. Although Ocean is arrested for violating his parole, he and Tess reconcile before his departure. Three to six months later, Ocean is released from prison and picked up by Tess and Rusty.

    "title": "The Expendables",
    "plot": "An elite group of mercenaries named The Expendables, who are based in New Orleans, deploys to the Gulf of Aden to save hostages on a vessel from Somali pirates. The team consists of leader Barney Ross, blade specialist Lee Christmas, martial artist Yin Yang, military veteran Gunner Jensen, weapons specialist Hale Caesar, and demolitions expert Toll Road. Gunner instigates a firefight, causing casualties for the pirates. He then tries to hang a pirate, but Yang stops him when Barney and the team discourage the idea. Barney reluctantly discharges him from the team. Later, Christmas is upset to discover his girlfriend Lacy has left him for another man. Barney and rival Trench Mauser visit \"Mr. Church\" for a mission. Trench passes the contract to Barney, which is to overthrow dictator General Garza in Vilena, an island in the Gulf of Mexico. Barney and Christmas fly to Vilena for undercover reconnaissance and meet their contact, Sandra, but are discovered. It is revealed that ex-CIA officer James Munroe is keeping Garza in power as a figurehead for his own profiteering operations, while Sandra is revealed to be Garza's daughter. Barney aborts, but Sandra refuses to leave Vilena. Meanwhile, Gunner approaches Munroe to help and Garza is angered further when Sandra is waterboarded for information by Munroe. Meanwhile, Lacy has been physically abused by her new man, so Christmas beats him and his friends, revealing what he does for a living. Barney and the group discover that Church is a CIA operative and the real target is Munroe, who has gone rogue and joined forces with Garza to keep the drug money that funds the CIA to himself, but the CIA cannot afford a mission to kill one of their own directly because of bad publicity. Barney meets tattoo expert and friend Tool to express his feelings. Tool makes a confession about letting a woman commit suicide instead of saving her. Barney is then motivated to go back for Sandra alone, but Yang accompanies him. Gunner and hired men pursue them on the road, ending in an abandoned warehouse, where Yang and Gunner fight a second time. Barney shoots Gunner when he attempts to impale Yang on a pipe. Gunner makes amends and gives the layout of Garza's palace. Barney boards the plane with Yang and finds the rest of the team waiting, and they infiltrate Garza's compound. Thinking Munroe hired the team to kill him, Garza has his soldiers' faces painted, preparing them for a fight. The team plants explosives throughout the site but Barney, while saving Sandra, is captured by Munroe's henchmen. The team saves him and kills the Brit, but is pinned down by Garza's men as Paine wrestles Barney. Caesar fights back and Paine escapes. Garza finally stands up to Munroe, ordering him out and returning his money. Instead, as Garza rallies his men against the Americans, Munroe kills him and escapes with Paine and Sandra. Garza's men open fire against the team, who fight their way through, detonating the explosives and destroying the compound. Toll kills Paine by burning him alive while Barney and Caesar manage to destroy the helicopter before Munroe can escape. Barney and Christmas catch up to Munroe, where they save Sandra and kill Munroe. Later, Barney donates his mission reward for Sandra to restore Vilena. The team has returned home and are celebrating at Tool's tattoo parlor with the recovering and now redeemed Gunner. Christmas and Tool play a game of knife throwing during which Christmas composes a mocking poem about Tool and throws a bullseye from outside the building.",

    "title": "Immaculate",
    "plot": "Sister Mary sneaks into a superior's bedroom at night and steals a ring of keys to escape through the locked gates of a Catholic convent. Four hooded figures capture her and break her leg, then knock her unconscious. Mary later wakes up in a coffin and is buried alive. Young novice Sister Cecilia turned to Christianity at an early age. After surviving a drowning in a frozen lake and being declared dead for seven minutes, Cecilia is convinced God had saved her for a purpose. She receives an invitation from Father Sal Tedeschi to join a convent in Italy that tends to dying nuns. Cecilia takes her final vows to adhere to the evangelical counsels and becomes a nun, being decorated with a rosary. Cecilia befriends Sister Gwen and is struck by certain oddities, such as an elder nun having cross-shaped scars on the soles of her feet. The convent's chapel houses a relic, a Holy Nail that was used to crucify Jesus. After having nightmares of hooded figures, Cecilia is shocked to learn that she is pregnant, even though she is a virgin. The convent's inhabitants begin to treat her as the next Virgin Mary, with many proclaiming the child is a \"blessing\". Another nun, Sister Isabelle, tries to drown Cecilia out of jealousy and later commits suicide. Cecilia throws up one of her own teeth and her health worsens. Her request to be taken to a proper hospital is denied by Father Tedeschi. Gwen publicly chastises the convent superiors for this abnormality but is then taken away by Father Tedeschi and Deacon Enzo. Cecilia notices the inscription \"2 Corinthians 11:14\" behind the Virgin Mary picture in her room, which leads to an ominous phrase in the Bible. At night, Cecilia sneaks around the covenant and finds her personal file, and is shocked to find information about her childhood accident and a karyotype. Hearing a woman screaming, she investigates and is horrified to witness a hooded figure cutting out Gwen's tongue. An elder nun appears and silences Cecilia. She begs to escape, but the elder chastises her, saying that she will never leave the convent. Cecilia fakes a miscarriage to be taken to the hospital, but the deception is exposed and she is tied up. Tedeschi explains that he was a geneticist before becoming a priest and used DNA samples taken from the Holy Nail to impregnate nuns in the hopes of ushering in a new messiah. Before Cecilia, Tedeschi's numerous attempts failed, often resulting in malformed fetuses. Tedeschi brands a cross into Cecilia's feet, as seen in other nuns. Cecilia makes another attempt to escape. She beats Mother Superior to death using a crucifix, and shortly afterward, her water breaks. She manages to strangle the cardinal with her rosary before dousing Tedeschi's lab in ethanol. Tedeschi arrives and tries to stop her through physical force, but Cecilia narrowly escapes by igniting the ethanol with a lighter. Tedeschi manages to break out of the laboratory after extinguishing the flames and continues his pursuit of Cecilia, forcing her to flee into the catacombs under the convent. Cecilia finds Gwen's mutilated corpse along with a hole in the catacomb's walls. Tedeschi finds her just as she is about to escape and a struggle ensues. Tedeschi tries to cut Cecilia's stomach open, but she stabs him in the throat with the Holy Nail relic, which she had previously stolen from the chapel. After exiting the catacombs, Cecilia agonizingly gives birth and bites through the umbilical cord herself. She is horrified by the sight of the baby, which is heard making strange, animalistic noises. Cecilia stumbles away to grab and lift a nearby rock, which she uses to crush it to death.",

    "title": "The Town",
    "plot": "Four lifelong friends from Charlestown, Boston, Douglas \"Doug\" MacRay, James \"Jem\" Coughlin, Albert \"Gloansy\" MacGloan, and Desmond \"Dez\" Elden, rob a bank wearing masks. Against Doug's wishes, Jem takes bank manager Claire Keesey hostage, but later releases her unharmed. After discovering Claire lives in their neighborhood, Doug follows her to find out how much she has told authorities and to ensure that Jem does not eliminate her, being a witness. Soon, a relationship grows between them, and Doug hides it from the gang. Claire, however, does not realize Doug is one of the robbers. Doug tells Claire of his long-lost mother, who he believes went to live with his aunt in Tangerine, Florida. He also talks about how he almost became a professional ice hockey player. She tells him she saw a tattoo on one of the robbers' necks but did not inform the FBI. Doug realizes that Claire could identify Jem and send them all to prison. Knowing that Jem will kill her if he knows, he dissuades her from talking. Doug accomplishes this by telling Claire that if she informs the police, they will put her in witness protection likely to live in another state. His plan works, and she remains silent. FBI Special Agent Adam Frawley recognizes the gang's ties to local Irish mobster Fergus \"Fergie\" Colm, who fronts as a florist. During a visit to his father Stephen in prison, Doug shares his plan to leave Boston for Florida. The gang's next job, an armored car robbery in the North End. They disguise themselves as nuns, it goes awry, and they barely escape. Frawley interrogates Doug and his associates but is forced to release them for lack of evidence and failure to extract a confession. Doug asks Claire to go away with him to Florida, and she accepts. She quits her job, unaware that Frawley has tapped her phone. Frawley then shows his file on Doug to Claire, threatening to prosecute her as an accomplice. Shocked and distraught that Doug was one of her assailants, she cooperates with the FBI and breaks up with Doug. Doug tries to back out of an upcoming heist at Fenway Park, angering Jem, who fights with him over it. Fergie then threatens to kill Claire if he does not cooperate. He also reveals to Doug how he controlled his father into doing his bidding by turning Doug's mother into an addict, which ultimately led to her suicide. Doug reluctantly agrees to do the job, but swears he will kill Fergie if anything happens to Claire. At Fenway Park, Doug and Jem enter disguised as Boston police officers. They steal $3,500,000 in gate cash, and prepare to escape in an ambulance disguised as paramedics. Frawley uses Doug's ex-girlfriend (and Jem's sister) Krista's drug addiction to turn her into an informant. The FBI, tipped off by Krista, surround the perimeter alongside police and state troopers. Caught in a shootout with FBI SWAT agents, Dez and Gloansy are killed. Frawley spots Jem and they exchange gunfire in which Jem is wounded and forced to take cover. Determined to not go back to prison, he then commits suicide by cop. Doug witnesses his death before escaping with a police cruiser. Knowing that Claire is in danger and that he will never escape as long as Fergie is alive, Doug kills both him and his bodyguard Rusty. After contacting Claire and watching from across the street, Doug spots the FBI with her. She manages to warn him away. Doug escapes by donning an MBTA uniform from his uncle, which he pays him for, and later grabs a train. Meanwhile, Frawley deduces that Claire tipped Doug off, but is too cryptic to provide grounds for an arrest. Later, while Claire is gardening, she finds a buried bag containing money, a tangerine, and a note from Doug suggesting she can make better use of it and that they might see each other again one day. Claire donates the money, in memory of Doug's mother, to refurbish the ice hockey arena where Doug once played. From the deck of a small house, Doug looks out over the water, forlorn, but seemingly safe in Florida.",
